A SHOCKING ACCIDENT. William Pearman, aged 21, a seaman on the Edina, had his right leg torn off yes terday morning, whilst the vessel was be ing toWed out of dock. This shocking acci dent occurred in view of a number of spectators, and was due to trouble with the hawser. ? Noticing that the rope did not run freely Pearman went to clear it, and at the time stood with his right foot in an eye. This suddenly became jammed, and was noticed to be round his right leg, just above the ankle. Before Pearman was quite awai-fi'^Jf his danger the eye closed round Ms* leg': like n vice, and vainly did the poor ffeHb,w 'struggle to release himself.1 With another sudden wrench the rope cut through his leg, 'tearing it off, the se vered portion falling through the hawse jpipe into ''the' river.
