VICTORIA The steamer Alexandra brings three days later from Melbourne, her dates being to Tuesday, the 11th instant. The Argus states that the ceremony of unveiling the Burke and Wills monument has been appointed for Friday, the 21st instant, the anniversary of the day on which the lamented explorers returned to Cooper's Creek from Carpentaria. It is mentioned by the same paper that the stables attached to Carisbrook Hotel, Carisbrook, were burned down on Wednesday night last. The night happened to be calm and by the active exertions of the in- habitants, the flames were prevented spreading. The damage done is estimated at about £500. The M. A. Mail states that, on the farm of Mr. Dainty, recently devastated by the bush fire, a number of fruit trees, which were severely scorched and rendered leafless, have since put forth blossoms. Upon some of his vines, also, which did not escape severe injury, small bunches of crapes are being thrown out. The Bendigo Advertiser states that Mr. Shadrach Jones, who was lately engaged very extensively in business in Dunedin, has left that city somewhat suddenly, on his way to England. Mr. Jones was formerly in business in Sandhurst. There are few people in Warrnambool (says the Examiner), who know that within one mile of the township there is one of the most prolific vineyards in the district. We allude to that of Mr. McLean, at Russell's Creek. During a visit there the other day, we saw enough to convince us what can be done by care and perseverance in bringing the grape vine to perfection in this district. The vines were absolutely breaking down with fruit, and from one root alone Mr. McLean estimates he will have ten hundred- weight, and we should fully anticipate such a result, several of the branches bearing from twenty to thirty pounds. The grapes are mostly sweet-water, although here and there there are muscatels and Hamburgs. The ground where the vineyard is situated is of a reddish-brown, and is well protected from the south and west winds. The Kyneton Observer says :-The total claims from sufferers by the late bush-fires are now in, and repre- sent a stated loss of £9994 4s. 8d., made up as under :- Crops, £5707 17s. 10d ; fencing, £1158 15s.; buildings, £1410 5s. ; furniture and clothes, £634 14s. ; stock, £131 3s. 6d. ; agricultural implements, £951 9s. In the entire list not one of the sufferers appears to have been insured. A very destructive fire occurred at Daylesford early on Sunday morning. It broke out about one o'clock, in Messrs. Little and Noble's hay and corn store, and quickly extended to the premises on each side. According to the Mercury, the premises destroyed and the loss, so far as it could be ascertained, were as shown in the following :-" Messrs. Little and Noble, hay and corn store, with stock of produce, &c;, and stables ;' Mr. John Little's private residence,' furni- ture, &c;, partiallv burnt, and damaged by removal, loss, &c.; ; Mr. Hitt, blacksmith's forge destroyed, stock of iron, felloes, spokes, and crriage-building timber, totally burnt ; Mr. Mainon, tobacconist, stock and furniture ; Mr. A. Cross, ditto. In the last two cases some salvage was made, but of course much damaged by removal, water, &c.; Some damage was also done to Jamison's hotel, by remora! of inflam mable matter, &c; as at one time that establishment stood in imminent danger. We are not able to give an idea of the amount of loss sustained by Messrs. Little and Noble, but it is certain that they had in the store a very heavy stock of produce, grain, & c., all of which is destroyed beyond salvage, besides a quantity of harness, &c.;, and the household furniture of Mr. Little. That firm is insured in the London and Lancashire In- surance Company for £400, and there is no truth in the rumour that the policy was invalidated by some neglect. Mr. Hitt's loss is not ascertainable, but he also had a considerable stock of iron, seasoned tim- ber, spokes, felloes, &c;, on his premises. Mr.Mainou estimates his loss at £100, and Mr. Cross puts his at about the same figure. Mr. Lerich's stock was some- what damaged by removal and peculation; he, how- ever, is covered by insurance in the Australasian office. He states his loss as at £80 or £90. Duriing the height of the fire, the premises of Messrs. Duffus, Tennant, and Coade, on the opposite side of Will square, were only kept from ignition by the applica- tion of wet blankets and water, flakes of fire of con- siderable size being carried across by the wind. The telegraph wire which crossed the street at ths point was burnt through. Our Railways.-The Herald of the 10th instant states that a report from the President of the Board of Land and Works relative to the Victorian Railways, w as presented to the Legislative Assembly on Friday evening. It has since been published, and we pre- sent an abstract of its more important statements. Ia' December last 225 miles were being worked, includ- ing the Echuca extension, which had only been opened for tiaflic on the previous month. The deben- tures issued amounted to £8,001,270, and the net revenue for the year 1864 to £272,000, which was equivalent to 3 1/2 per cent, on the debenture capital. The actual expenditure, from loans and the consoli- dated revenue, appears, from one of the numerous* tables appended, to have been £8,783,124 7s. 5d., exclusive of £103,640 retained per centages and balances due on contracts. It is estimated, however, that ere the lines are completed, £9,490,000 will have been expended, or an average cost of £37,200 per mile. A comparison is made between this sum and the cost on seven of the prin- cipal English lines, there being only two constructed at less expense than the Victorian-namely, the Lon- don and South Western, £32,229, and the Great Eastern, £32,792. The gross revenue for 1864 was £515,538, being an increase over the preceding of £50,843. The goods traffic increased by £56,697, but the passengers and miscellaneous decreased by £5854. Tlie working expenses are increased by £7929; but the per centage has been reduced from 50 1/4 in 1863 to 47 1/4 in 1864. The per centage of only one English line is stated-namely, the Great Northern, which in 1863 was 5. The Murray line appears to be more profitable than the Ballaarat. The traffic on the former was £295,668 an increase of £55,415- whilst that on the Ballaarat branch has decreased. from £195,330 to £190,443. Owing to the economy practised in the working expenses, however, the de- partment continues to show a net increase in the revenue of £176. The decrease is chiefly occasioned in the passenger traffic, for although there were 201,143 passengers carried in 1864, as against 19.3,502 in 1863, the revenue was less by £7205 ; this result being attributable to the system of return and pas- senger traffic. On the Murray line there were 400,620 passengers in 1864 as against 351,503 in 1863, and on the Williamstown 362,066 as against 270,838. The revenue, however, was not proportionately benefited, and it is argued, that the working of the English lines affords no ana- logy as to the results which might be expected from still further reductions in the charges on the colonial railways, as our population is of limited extent. The comparative freedom from casualties which has existed is matter for congratulation, as from the opening of the lines in March, 1859, till 1864, the number of accidents have been very few, and there have been none of those disasters which are unfortu- nately of such frequent occurrence on the English ; and American railways.
