FORESTRY IN yiCTOKlA. ?';,,..- j Sir,— Having read- with deep interest the, articles in The Leader upon forest culture in Victoria, and the able mariner in whioh -the subjeot is treated, I have long looked for the time when this subjeot would lead to some practical result. It is pitiable to see the amount of deBtruotion in the State forests of Viotoriaj caused' by bush-fires, the omonnt of wealth' consumed, robbing the artisan of that which' Bhould. furnish him with employment arid coh ter a oenent upon iuo uuuiuiuuib^. x uubu tuu day is fast dawning when the hand of the ar tisan wi'l be engaged in converting the hidden wealth to good account. I see that already at the - foot of Mount Maoedon there ia a oabinet factory of no mean pretensions, turning the' old charred logs into that which is a standing proof of the adaptability of our colonial tim ber for the manufacture of . cabinet furniture.) It only requires the presence of those ao-: quainted with Mr Weber's theory to select the timber in the proper season, and select those best adapted far the various branches of in dustry in order to remove tho prejudice that exists against colonial woods. There is no .timber that comes into our market better adapted to our wants than that grown on our own soil. As a practioal meohanio of 16 years working in Australia, I pledge my reputation that there is not a branch of business but what can be supplied suooosBfally with tho fol lowing'timbors:— Kauri pine,Huon pipe, cedar, blue giim, red gum, myall, boxwood, iron bark, blaokwood, myrtle, and a variety of other timbers wbioh the workmen of Australia are ac quainted with, and whioh, if properly seasoned 1 maintain, are more durable and less Bubjeot to dry-rotfthan that of any of the imported timbers known to us.
