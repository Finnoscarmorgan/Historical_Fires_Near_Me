V " Varieties. f I heard a Boniface, who keeps a comfortable k hotel not a hundred miles down the Bay, tell n /" good yarn the other eTening.

" I will acquaint the landlord, Y Bir," said the waiter, "and see if ho' his any ( left." Now mine host, who had taken stock of ) his customer, was equal to the occasion. He ( had a good stock of vigorine in tho house, so, J washing off the label, in went the waiter with f a bottle of gold-top, and informed the gent y that his master had found a case.

" He remained a Week," said ) Boniface, " and when he paid his bill, which ( Included twenty-four bottles of gold-top, at six ) shillings a bottle, ho paid me the compliment ( of saying that he never drank better gold-top ) in his lile, for it did not give him the head- C ncho." ...
