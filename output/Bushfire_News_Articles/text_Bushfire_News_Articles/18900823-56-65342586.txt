Tale. My Wedding Day. A SOUTH AUSTRALIAN STORY. Chapter I. ' Well, Miss Grey, you aro going to havo a sooroher,' said Mr. Grcon, as ho greeted me one summer morning. I would gladly have doubted his word, for it was Christmas day, and, more, my wed ding day, as wall ; but early an it irna, the : Bun was shining from a cloudless sky — aliin . ing with all his might ; and, though he embrowned tho grass and baked tno earth, . and pumped up every drop of water long ugo, . leaving nothing bnt hot stones in the oreek ; beds, he sot to work as if he had just taken a contraot to dry up the deluge and wanted to get done in time, . 1 - Ah, well,' I said, trying to make the best of it, ' well, blessed is the bride the sun ?nines on, you know. : I left the shady verandah and wont across to the wool-shed to give a finishing touch to ' the wedding breakfast, already laid there on : a long.' table improvised for the occasion. Only the decorating part was left to mo ; 'and as I arranged guoh greenery and flowers as I had, the old saw kept running in ray bead: 'Blessed is the bride the gun '?nines on.' Surely the Omen is true, this once, for was there aver suoh a splendid fellow as Jack or suoh a Iuckv girl as Then I thought of my past life, and won dered if I was the same Mary Grey who two years — yes, only two years — ago had been all. alone in the world. I remembered my timid, soared feeling at being among strangers when I came as governess to this up-oountry run. How queer ihe life had seemed at first, and how home-like it seemed now. It was hard to realise that I could ever be afraid of , Mrs. Green, who was like a loving mother to me. , I soon got to like my work, too ; and then — yes, then carao Juok, and ha/1 things been ever co bad, life would have seemed ; oouleur de rose to me. So I was dreaming over my work that hot Christmas morning thirty years ago, when I was disturbed by Minnio Green. ' Oh, oome . anu see Mr. Stanley [Dick Stanley was to be . Jack's best man], and Mr. Brice, and — with i emphasis — ? the parson ! Suoh a funny little man, Hiss Grey, with yellow hair, and a pink face like a baby's and white hands. Do parsons always have pink faces and white hands.' . ; i ? M+V1\,M. UHU »u uff W4 «UU-VJ *** HUB Tf VHU It ? thla question, for just then Jaek appeared 'and Minnio having gono to havo another ,: look at the clerio'a English complexion and white hands which bad so impressed her, we fell into a conversation, [interesting enough ' ' to ourselves, but of no concern to outsidors ? till we were interrupted by Mrs. Green. '. ' ? Wellj upon my word,* she said, ? what on earth can you two have to talk about P Come Jury ; It is time for you to think of dressing You oan't havo anything vory particular to My to Jack hero, and if you have.^here in all the rest of your life to say it in.' With' whioh profound remark she sent Jaok to the dimngr- roDm, where a pionio sort of first breakfast was going on ; and taking me to ''' 'my room, she brought me a a cup of tea and told me to restalittlo, for I had a thirty-mile ride before me. Now, though my dress was simple in tho ? extreme, and I could have put it on myself in five minutes, being a bride I must be dressed. Mrs. Green und Minnio, who was to he my bridesmaid, undertook this office and hindered me sadly. My drets was plain . wnue musun, piinpiy made, ana I had not . intended wearing a veil ; but Mrs. Green said . that as they seldom saw a wedding, and she did not suppose I would bo married again i , in a hurry, I might as well do the thing in , Style . while I was about it ; so to please her ,.. I shrouded myself in a lorjgth of plain tulle . ; that oovered me almost from head to foot, !. really the effect wai rather good. , At last I was dressed ; but somehow wo1 managed to bo late and it was a quarter of ?n hour behind time when I went aoroea to .':- the wood-shed on Mr. Green's arm ; while . ' Biddy held - an umbrella over my head, and Mrs. Green followed sticking in utterly tin v:! necessary pins to the vory last moment. -, .(Every one was waiting ; nnd the shed deco ..' rated .with suoh greenery as was available, looked quite festive. At one end stood the j m breakfast table with the cake, home marie but imposing, a towering monument to Mm. , Green's housewifely skill. By a small table ?tood the clergyman in his surplice, looking v ? trifle out of place ; whilo round about were .-arranged all available seats from chain to . mukinfr-ntcols and slab benohep, with stiok v .legs. They were all occupied, for as I have i- already said, a wedding was not an every. ?? day occurrence, and people had turned out in ' lull force. . ' 'Wo advanoed with all possiblo decorum, ' and the oeremony proceeded as usual t;ll the ' ring had bten put on and tho blessing given, when some one,' breathless and dusty, dashed in at the door and cried,*''' Fire ! - Bush firje 1 Close : here.'. 'Instantly 'most 'of the forms were upset and there was a xush for the' door. ' 'Hi ! Stop a minute,' cried Jack, as 'he collared his two friends and dragged them back, 'we will get this over now.* , ._,,!' The clergyman .hesitated, ithen^ skipping a good deal, lie began the exhortation on which wives get so much good advice and husbands ao little. . . . ,,„ „ ./?..,;.'. .,,:.) ? \ ,' 1 Oh, never mind all that,' ? cried' . Jack, stamping with impatience : ' we will have the. ? amazemsnt' and all .the rest of it seme other time. What |h»ve we to sign P. Be quick.* . ; . ? , ....,-? . :.? j . . Jaok's ' friend* made the poor olergyman show where he had to sigh, and we all did it : in a dasperate hurry, the two 'witnesses, scrawling something when their turn came and bolting at once. Jack- just took me in his arms and gave me a hurried kiss. * Good by, dear litile wife,' he whispered, ' good by' ; and he was feone, leaving me and tne clergyman alone together. - ?? j Ho— tho clergyman — was a younsr man just out from home. He had a clear com plexion and fair hair parted down the middle and was altogether the : mlldest-Iookiriir little man imaginable ; his little round face just now displaying the blankest possible astonishment. ,' Ye husbands — love'th him self— yr wives— subject— plaiting of hair and wearing of gold — araazoment,* he mat* tered incoherently, looking from me, stand ing alone in my white veil and dress, to the deserted and upturned forms, and the cake towering la solemn grandeur; to the end of the room.' I believe he manfully intended to do his duty, if no one else did, and finish that ceremony to tho bitter end ; but to read ' that exhortation at one poor woman left all' alone would have been, to say the least of it, personal ; so he gave it up and shook hands, as is the practice of clergymen.',' . j : 'I— I wish you ovory happiness, Mrs.' Rushton,' he stammered ; then, remembering that I had . just been unceremoniously de serted by my bridegroom, and not ..being sure whether such was the 'oustom of, the country or not, he muttered something about ' sympathy' ; and then, gathering his wits together with a violent effort, he burst i out like Mr. Wilkie ;? - Where are theyP .What is the meaning of this most indecorous .be haviour? , ;.,;.,'? j -, ' . , I ; I did not answer, but ran to the door to lookout. ?,-;?. ?
