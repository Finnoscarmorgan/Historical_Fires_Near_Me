The returns in wool and stock are taken from a good dip of 116 bales, averaging 18JA at last miss in 'London. Tbe actual expenses of washing, shearing, conveyance, &c.; are given. Olie' estimate of the capability of the best gnting land on the Lower Wimmem, adopted in this case, is that given by a lessee of such land, who has fully tested its capability, and is in aooordance with my own experience. In the following calculations so allowance it made for the risks of soab or other diseases in the sheep, for seasons of drought, lack of increase, or bush-fires. It may be supposed from the figures given herewith, that any lessee who pays 2s. per acre under such cireum stances will forfeit his improvements at the end of the term, if not sooner.

It would therefore be liable to forfeiture, as well m the lease, within two years. To arrive at the result, if the farm were 10,000 scree, mixed sheep are supposed to be tbe stock, one-half being breedibg ewes, and the eumjos stock of young wethers and aged ewes sold at current prices yearly.
