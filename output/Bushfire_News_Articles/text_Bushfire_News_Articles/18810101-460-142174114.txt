VICTORIA. MARYBOROUGH, THURSDAY. A large bush-fire was raging at 1 p.m. about & mile and a half from Avoca. It com- menced in Mr. Morrish's paddock, where it burned the grass and fencing. From thence it spread to Mr. Buhlert's land, and after wards to Kaye's, where strenuous exertions were being nade to stay its further progress. The conflagration is regarded as a serious one, and likely to menace Avoca. The cry of fire was raised in Maryborough this afternoon, but as it was only in a small garden plot the flames were soon extinguished.
