TESTIMIONIAL TO THE 1EV. FATHER ItO ALROY. ON TVoWednesday evening a mooeting was hold in the large room over Mir. lRogers's for the purpose of taking steps for getting up a testimonial to the Rev. Father bII Alroy. On the motion of Mr. Charles Gillespio the chair was talen by Mr. lIc Govern. The Chairman road the advcrtisement calling the meoeting. He then proceeded to say that some of our meetings in Goulburn wero noisy, but generally they weont on favourably. On the present occasion there could be no necessity for cautioning the people on this subject. Ho would therefore call on those who were to take part in the meeting to do so. He then called on Mlr. Philip Dignam to move the first resolution. r. Digunam, Mr.P., then moved That thin moetleg, In nlew of the greet progret male by the Catholic church in the Goulburn district during tihe eour ytnre that It hns been unrder Father Me Alrey's charrge, con gratulatet him upop the success thet hosr under Ood's bloss Ong, attended ids efforte. Ho had not come prepared with any sot speech, inasmuch as on a quIeCtion of this kiind any person who was a catholic could speak without preparation. He felt hound to call attention to fircts within his own knowledge relative to this district. When a young man hie had to come many miles to attllend to his duty, antd then had to kneel down in a small building opposite the Argyle Store. Withll tire blessing of God they had got over lthis. lThey had their churlch, their presbytery, and thecir regular minister. oBut theo benrefits derived from the labohurr of Father Mc Alroy were not confined to Goalburn. He had been the meanls of erectinrg buildings for tihe worship of God in many places in the brush. With all their feelings to their own church thley wero happy to kInow that other churches hald ministers who were striving to do tthat whicih lhey rhad rc ceeded in doing. It had been said that their people had no particularly good feeling towards other bodies of Christians; buit he believed that no other body were more anxious tiran theioy that all should Ihave the moans of worshipping their lIrker. It was arl avys their desiro to contribute towards thie support of their minister end to erect buildigsr in all parts of the district so tirat all people shcorrid have lire threCrens of approaching their SIaker properly. Let trhem look round the district, and contemplate the amount of energy that must rhave been brought to bear to erect so many places of worship. There had ahlays been the fatal mistake in their body thiat they were not sufficiently united except when called upon by the church; but whenever this was done he had never'found anyone refuse to give towards the erection of churches. Look at tire churches at the Brcadalbano and at Tarrlga. ie tioir thouht tit ce could challenge any other district to shoaw that so much had been done with such limited means during the lato bad seasons. MeIost of the membere of their church were men whoso means depended entirely on their own exertions. He could enlargo on the subject of Father Me Alroy's labours; but y was afrlid he might he trespassing on their time. i lIo was proud to take part in this meeting. Tlhey I had o n blessedleh with a clergmae es energetic is f any in Now South Wales; and he trlusted that thisi a mnooting would show that they respected energy and a talent and porseverance. And that, thev were fully aware of the blessicgs they had received through I the labolrs of their present pastor. Mr. John \Walsh, in seconding theo resolution, said that they ought to show their appreeiotion of the moen of talent and energy that were omong them. Fathor lc Alrov he beoliered had donoe more thtn any other clergyman in Now South Wales. It had been said that Father Mc Alroy needed no other testimonial than the convent of the sisters of morcy. But this brought no return to him: it remained only for the benefit of the people. Without the assistance of the poople no doubt Father Mc Alroy could do but little; but still not the less was it true that to his exertions was due all that had been done. It lhad been said that the present was not a fit time to present a tostimnonial to Father Ic Aloroy. It had bedn said that they should wait till he was going away, or till harvest was over. Now it wasn not known that Father Mo Alroy was going at all; so that if they waited they might have to wait for some years. And with respect to the harvest, he thought that that would be gathered in by the time they iwoer ready to present the testimbnial. Me begged leave to second the resolution. The resolution was then put and carried unoani motsly. MIr. Patrick Sheehy proposed: lIsh tidts meetino Is" sf 'orslen thlat tho:'exiraordtnary ] nerety snd seal dlsptnayed sby Fatther Ste Array In tsle erectons ot tloc convent snd ansoroum otaurohes thmrsoout the mission,, 00sneit ots in the exeise of ehis orietlty funsctioos, imperatively roil foe a substntlia rerosnition from thoss la wlooso hehslf he hbo so uuremustlntgtly ioutoe"d. Father Mc Alr'oys 'claims were so many that he should have to. confino himself to a few. "His labours in Ireland, and in Victoria, and at Yoss, highly appreciated as they had been, seemed only to have invigorated him for increased efforts in the Goulburn district. The variouis places in this dis trict whore he had erected churches prevented people from having to meet in public-housds. His piety and his 'holiness of lifo, is well as his energy, ren dered him worthy of ail that could he soid in ilis praise, while his charity towards the distressed and his mnniflcenco were lnown throughout the southern districts. M[r. Lynch seconded the resolution. He had long sines arrived at the conclusion that Father Ing Alroy wasnoordinary man. Severe and numerous as his labonrs had boon, so wetll had they been performed that his people reverenced him and looltked to him as their best friend. lio hlad always paid the highest respect to occlesiastical authority, and his good quali ties had gained for him the esteem of those of other religious persuasions. Whlen all presoent wore detad and gone the edifices he had roeared would remain as lasting memorials to his honour. The resolution was then put and carried unani mously. Mr. P. T.

Mr. Dignam, i.P., then addiressed a fewt words to thle meeting expressing his osatisflction at the erec tion of the convent of the elsters of mercy, which prevented their having to senod their daughters to a distance to school.

'iThe object of fho meeting, which was called by advertisement, was to consider the best course to adopt for getting up thle Goulburn annueal races for 1867. After some little discussion, it was thought advisable to find out if thie Argyle Jockey Club intended to take any steps to hlave a race-meeting dering tIhe coming nutumn. Should this club not be dispocsed to takeo the matter in hcand, anothter publie meeting will Ie called to makle aIr rangemenuts for getting up races, collecting soubscrip tion, &e.; We acre glad thact there is somne prospect of oucr ccannual races being revived, and think it was wise postp~ecieg the matter to learn whether the Jockey Club is still in existence or not. It certaioly hlls been in abeyance for two or three years past. Whlen we look back esd thinkl of what the Goulburn races were some years ago, when Jorrocks, Plo'ver, Splortsman, MIuleyson, Samson, and other crackst, contested for our prizes, we cannot help wishing success to the present movement. A good race meeting always denotes prosperity, and would now be n sign that better times have set in.

A reident, who for two years could scarcely move about, even with the aid of crutches, can now walk briskly with no better help thau ' walking-stick, the remldial agent being flour of' sulphur. The mode of applicatlion is very sinple, consisting merely in dredging the sotcks with s!ulphUr, so that the sales of the nlaked feet are in cntinuous contact with it.

Saturday is said to Isavo been thIe hottest day yet experienced, but that would be difficult to determine. On that day the thermometer rose to 1410 degrees Farenhoit in the sun, and 105 degrees tsronheit in the shade. On Sunday afternoon there was an appearance of rain, but it passed away.

PUnILIC Scinoor ArT EseU CIsREKc.--W'VO learn with much pleasure that an application has been sent to the Council of Education in Sydney, to whom has been entrusted the initiation throughout the colony of the provisions of the Public Schools Act, intro duced in Parliament by the colonial secretary, and passed into law after an opposition, which for viru loncy, distortion of fisets, outbursts of ignorant bigotry, and general disregard of Christian feeling, has never been surpassed in this colony, whlich has been fismous for its veoxed quelstions. The schools established under thsi act will be found of incaleul able benefit in theb country districts, especially on the gold-flolds, the inlhabitants of which are strong advocates of sscalr educatlion, and will, we doubt not, fully appreciate the boon conferred on their elhilsren. Tllero are about two hundred children on this gold-field fit for school, inearly all of whomu are now growimg up in idlsenss and vice, iand ignorant of their duty to tlheir Czeutor aind society. W'o ernestly hope thait, whenu this school is established, parests will endeavour to sendl their children regu larly to it, and so fit them to fight their battle with the world on something like even terms.

Busr-rrlars.-Th exotremo dryness of the grass and of thire stubble in thie cultivation paddocks ren ders it very necessary that every precantion should be trlen to prevent ignition which would in all like lihood lead to enormous bush-fires. On Saturday last a very extensive fire was very nearly occurring at Fairyholo Creek, Yass district, owing to PIr. Alt having commenced to burn off his stubble. Tirhe fire communicated with the grass outside thre pad dock, and had it not been for vigorous measures it woulrd be impossible to oay where the devalstation would have ended. Mr. Zouch has had a narrow escape from being a sufferer. His crop of wheat had been cut and'i tooked and was waiting to be drawn in, when some heedless juvenile sportsmen visited the paddock and commenced to discharge their fowl isg-pices amongst the stubble at the birds that were garnering. Instead of using wads they had resorted to thie less expcnsivo mratcrilal of paper, whlich of coarse ignited, and filling amongst the stubble it quiclly caught fire. LIad it not been for timely aid the whole of the wheat stooks would probably have been destroyed. Owing to some similar folly on the part of the lovers of the gun, Mr. Ledger, of the Little River, has had nearly the whole of his grass burnt. Surely thie most ardent sportsmen should have some consideration for the property of others, and more so when that which is imperilled wasm cul tivated for human food.-Yass Courier. To Sonscarntnns.-The Tumut Times has the following remarks, which are equally applicable to our own ease. WV need only add that those of our debtors who haysve already received nlawyer's lotters, or whoso papers lihave beeni discontinued, may rely on receiving summonses for the next district or small debts court in their neighborhoods:-Our accounts for the past rquairter are now rendered, and we desire to'draw the attention of subscribers to a maitter personal to ourselves. For a long time past large nrumbers of them have been dilatory in satisit'iog our demands, and owe regret to lind some of trree, foer, five, and ven esix years in arrears. Soeiurg tIhat tire times Ihad Ilren bad, we have not been hard upon dcfiurltcrs; but have waited patiently in the hope that they would at last pay up. It is not in our power to waiit any longer. The pro duction of this journal every wecli involves a hoeavy cash expcnditure, which must be met. When this goes on for three, six, nino, and twelve months, without any return, our readers will realise some of the dlifficulties of our position; but when con stituents presume upon our leniency, and neglect to pay for a period of five or six years, then it becomes time that we should take active steps to enforce payment. Although our need has at times boon grerat, we have sel dom attempted to cnfbreo payment by harsll means, in the hlope that by showing consideration to others, mwe shlould receive like treatment at their hands. But we have not. rWe must be just as well as generous. ,Vs now appeal to the good fiithl of defaulting subscribers to settle up without further delaiy. We should be sorry to be compelled to hiave recourse to what are generally termed harsh means; but in the case of accounts of long standing there seems to be no other alternative ; and we herewith give a fial notice, tbhat after the 31st instant, ill unpaid accounts of more than two years standing will be sued for in tire next district court. If dofirulting subscribers would onrly bear in mind that their filurilre to pay has been a great and seriours hin drance to us, they would not regard thire determina tiohn at which we hlave arrived as a harsh one. Wo respectfully solicit an immediate settlement of thlb accounts; rand we regret to say that, with reference to those of long stanrding, we must use legal pressure. In order that there maiy be no oxcuso we invite pay mont in any form that may be most con veenint, either in postage-stamps, bankl-notes, post- oelice orders, or any other way, but pay ment we must have made, and that within the prcescribed tiine. We are obliged to write thus plainly, because when we conch our application fior payment in mrilder terms we are not understood, at lanst it would soornm 8so from the non-compliance with .our oft-repeated requests. Defaulters who come within the pale of our remarks will, therefore, take rnotice that on the first of February next, should their accounts be thleon unpaid, they will be handed over to our solicitor for legal recovery, and this without fail. We have now another class of detralting subscribers to address, viz., those who do not pay small sums, and never intend to pay large amounts. We regret to find thait we have somen of this class in our books, alnd to such we inotify that urnlcss we are fivoured with a settlement of their small accounts before the end of this month, wo sharll discontinue supplying them with the news paper, and decline to furnish it unless payment be mardo quarterly in advance. We trust our sub scribers, to whom these compulsory remiarks apply, will take heed and avoid the unpleasantness of legal proceedings, as well as the additional expenses attending it.
