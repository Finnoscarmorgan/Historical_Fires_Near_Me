SOUTH AUSTRALIA. ' Parliament has been prorogued to the 14th of February. The papers almost daily report ex tensive bush-fires, causing immense destruction of crops and other property. Upon the loss of crops generally, the Register of the 20fch makea this gloomy comment: â€” 'From the statements ef our special reporter, who has just returned from meetings held at Wilkston, Sheoak Log, and Templars, it appears that the more tho state of the crops is inquired into throughout the country which lies within a radiua of 10 or 15 miles round Gawler the worse are the accounts which are received. The harvest, in fact, so far as those places are concerned, is a complete failure. Under these deplorable circumstances, we are glad to hear that several of the largest landowners, in the cose of tenant formers, have stepped forward and liberally granted remissions of rent. But, in addition to this, it seems absolutely certain that seed wheat will have to be supplied under some such regulations as those which we lately referred to as being adopted a little while ago in New South Wales.'
