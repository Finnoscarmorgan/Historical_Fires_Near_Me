Wax Vestas and Bush-Fires. I am, sir, &c.;, ROCKET. Winton, 16th September. Sir, —Cannot something be done to prohibit the importation or use of wax vestas in this colony? More than half of the bush fires this Tear have been caused by them. Men muster- Ing (through carelessness) drop them about the paddocks and the rats ignite them. This is no supposition of mine, sb wo had an ocular de monstration of the fact. While we were camped out the other night we saw a rat nibble at a match and set fire to the grass. Should we have another good season, and should nothing be done in the matter, there will be a tremendous loss of property, of stock, and per haps of human life. Hoping someone will take the case in hand.—
