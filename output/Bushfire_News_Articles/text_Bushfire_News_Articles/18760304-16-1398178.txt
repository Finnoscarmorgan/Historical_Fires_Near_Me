Blackall [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] February 18. FINE rain has fallen at Blackall and as it has the appearance of being a general rain, I trust it may prove to be so. The rain fell through a period of about twelve hours, at times in smart showers, but not as yet sufficiently heavy to make much water. It will, however, give the grass a fine start, which was much wanted, as, from the long continuance of dry weather and the destruction caused in the grass by bush fires, feed was in some places becoming un- pleasantly scarce, although I have not heard of any actual loss. On the contrary, stock has been doing remarkably well, and if this rain has been general, all inconvenience from scarcity of feed will be removed ; but more and heavier rain is required to replenish exhausted waterholes ; more especially on the dry country between the Barcoo and the Thomson Rivers ; not only for the use of the stock, but also to enable dam making operations to be car- ried on, as there are large tracts of country there, entirely destitute of water ; after a short interval of dry weather, enough not even being procurable to keep the men at work, without carting it long distances. February 19. I am informed by the manager of Lorne, who came in last night, that the rain did not extend to that station, and that they will be badly off for grass for lambing. Also, a gentleman from the Thomson yesterday informed me that the rain only reached about five miles past Avington, down the river. So that it was only a local rain after all News of general interest is scarce, but sev oral matters of local importance might chum attention Notibly,theextremeapathyof the Government m regard to the Court house hue Tho coutroct foi tins building was intended to be let at the same time a» that for the Lands Ofh«e but it vv as discov end then vvns not money enough m the oiigmal estimate to complete the tvvo buildings mid as the Louds Ofhee was the moie important it was completed, omi had at hist to do duty as Post Othce, Police Court, Ciown Linds Oflice, Gov el mm nt bavmgs Bunk, and audience room m gener ii for my body or iv irj body vv ho might hive business with the C C L , the P Al, or the CPS , nud the most absind thing is, tint all this time the timber foi the new Court li nise is lying warping and rotting on the giound, on tho proposed site of the building lints something liku £200 or £2 i0 vvoith of timber, procuicd tttidet considei tble diflicitlty, will be allowed to becomo useless for tho want of the necessaiy expenditure toeiect it into a building 'lho leeson given foi the present state of things is that the woik was not done withm the original estimate, but, let mc ask, how many Government works-oi, foi tho mitter of th it, piivato works either-ne com pleted for the first pioposed estimate?
