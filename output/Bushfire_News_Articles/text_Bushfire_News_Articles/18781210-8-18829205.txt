GRATFON. Friday. [Evening JVews.]-The lengthened spell of dry weather has broken, and there have been some light showers in the vicinity of the town. Outside of the municipality there was very heavy rain last night. It is reported that the House at Mountain View, the pro- perty of Mr. David Laird, was completely gutted by fire last night. It was only partially insured, mostly in the Victorian Insurance Company. Bush-fires have been prevalent in the vicinity of the house for some days, but they had been quite subdued. The house has boen untenanted for a considerable time, the proprietors having another house where they reside, at some distance from the place de- stroyed. The house, which is built of stone, and the land on which it was built, was ad- vertised as the first prize in the Mountain View Estate Lottery. The ticket holders are anxious as to the results. The fire has not yet been officially reported to the police, but it will most likely be done in the course of the day, when there will probably be an inquiry held. The entrances for the South Grafton Maiden Plate are Yarraman, "Woodpecker, Princess, and Beatrice ; and for the Handi- cap, Stockwell, Tomboy, Bullocky, Euroda, Yarraman, Tartar, and Tocal. A Masonic lodge, under the Scotch consti- tution, called the " Livingstone," has been formed at Rocky Mouth. Much satisfaction is expressed here at Mr. Bawden's action in the Assembly on the Land Bill, and especially on his giving notice of a motion of confidence in the Government.
