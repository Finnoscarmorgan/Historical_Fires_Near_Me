In America^ attention of Congress was lately directed to the importance of forming extensile plantations on the prairies, and of repairing in some degree, in those states wbwh a generation back were occnmed by "the bootT),," the 2S occasioned by the too sweeping clearances of the- settler. And in reference to the prairies a very curious circumstance is mentioned. Never in man's memory or tradition were there forests on thbse vast grassy plains-nothing but scattered belts of timber beside the watercourses; but since the migrations of the conatleu herds, of buffalo were interrupted by the | settler's presence tfees of various kinds are growing up in many directions, *nd if theire, be only a little human Forbear, ance and protection nature seems regdj to furnish extensive forests whAethey werie never seen before.^ The trampling j of cattle and their habit of browsing on the tender shoots are fatalto the growth of trees-a fact which must be reool I lected in the care of our Victorian State forests. , While our woods fare Btijl extensive u the time for* judicious selection offotwt reserves, and reserves have accordingly been made under the Land Aclfe<)f;l(J6t and 1865. A board has been fytfnM to consider the best means ,0f ptyfrptfog and improving theft, and the repeat; of the board is now before us- Under the Land 4.ct of 1802, 8,567 acres weretbw set taide, with 24,000 more specially for the supply of timber. Under the amend ing act of 1865 the total reserve if 82,866 acres. There are only two forests of considerable extent included in the list-Bullarook, of 42,000 acres, and Dan denong, of 25,000; the rest are of small size. Butihe.boardjrigUUy recommend* that fromiime to .time, particular tracts of counter, which ^iyibe lfound unsaid able for settlement shall be added,-and duly. pK^t^and^t^LiJfear Mel bourne all the goddTreea h^ve long since been cut down,$nd,tl>e citizen nnac* quainfced with the bush has no ideiof the magnificent timber to be seef |n the more secluded andmoister mountain region*. Mr. Pebcy Ho»&KiK8oir;, iionoraiy «e' cretaiy to the board, found, near the sburce# tbfc Wori Yallook, a tree jraich i|i a'atyrafght line measured 330ft. jth® diameter Ift.from (lie ground was 19ft) Muyoftti, tgrot tiM ^ lug&£-tQnK'a*te> « twenty-such |^,of ^apparent frffl,P height 22SXBSS2&9& - ~^y ^TJiereTs an enormous coneutnp '^tfvaodin this colony-nothing'like ^ it WEB some years ago, weather Zrd bouses beiDg fewer, but very great rill The report tells ub that sjnde the Seorery of the gold-fields we havepaid f er eight and a hSlf millions sterling for Vprfed-timber, and it is recommended ' be extensive plantations bf ine the wood most in demand by,the builder. On the gold-fields there ;i8 already great inconvenience as to the supply of wood suitable for underground j/res. The adjacent woodlands being Bsed up- tIie articIe ifls to brought long distances. It has become'a "very "gerioiis item of miningexpenditure/'and jf by and by scarcer and dearer, the cir cumstance " will seriously interfere with "our mining enterprise." State forests, if properly managed, will prevent this failure of supply. The report proposes to place them under the control of com jniBsioners to be appointed trustees, and that there shall be a new code of conditions to be observed by persons licensed to cut timber within the reserves, The privilege, so liberally extended, of faking timber ad libitum from Crown lauds has been shamefully abused by licensees of all sorts. They not only t"ake Trhat they want, but we are told waste a hundred times more. They cut down timber and pick the best, leaving 'the remainder on the ground, to furnish material for the next bush-fire. Ejval sawyers, on the dog-in-the- manger principle, cut down more than they .re quire, merely to prevent'an opponent getting it, or "to block up hisaccesp to "some coveted patch of fine timber.*' Then, to construct the bark shanty of the wood cutter a multitude' of the best stringy bark trees are destroyed, as only one sheet of bark is -taken from each tree. All this sort of thing the board Would" amend within the State fore'Bts; Kul Itl8 a in reference ^to!lour 1 woodland at $0 manv.has ^ . right to abuse a privilegfe jo iibera% extended by the State, and it sfceftiB to us that on a clear conviction the offender's licence ought to be cancelled, or else such a fine inflicted as would prevent a repetition' of the malpractice. . We cannot* see tjiat. some check on the present gross system of recklessly wasting our timber resources: should be considered a hardship fey'any*' body. It is not permitted in Europe, and it is4 time to moderate the (evil in Fictoria. , I The report contains A long' iiat of valuable English and other exotic trees which it ib desirable to plant in the State forests, and which grow far more rapidly., here than in the old countries. . Also a Hist of native trees which it is important not only to plant in the reserves, but to protect wherever found now. Such are the sassafras, valuable in medicine; black* Wood, dogwood, musk wood, &c.;, of great value to % cabinetmaker and turnier; the three species of caUijxis, now. in1 dinger, of extinction, and whioh yield a fine resin; the hop-scrub, in whichthfere is a principle resembling quinine; the acacia, the bark of which already largely exported for tanning; and a hjost more of trees and shrubs at present wantonly destroyed or used/or the meanest purposes. We hope this very snggeetive reporfwill soon be made the hash of Bome practical legislation' \ in deference to our forests. . '
