DRILLING VOLUNTEERS. To the Editor of the Times. Sir—In Jamaica and other colonies it is tlio practice to meet at an early hour in the morning. In a word, in the coolest hour of ilayliyht. And why should it be otherwise here, where the heat is equal to the tropics ? This evening the artillery meet at half-past 4. Is it possible that they can do so without cruel discomfort, and, in truth, without positive risk of sickness being the result. The dog-day will tell. The suggested arrangement involves, | ho doubt, nn audible bugle call. This may be a serious obstacle, but I throw out the hint. NOT CHEVRON. Reported Destruction of tiie City of Melbourne by Fire.—Yesterday a rumour was very prevalent in town to the effect that half of the above city had been destroyed by a lire, the work of incendi aries and rioters. The rumour, however, appears to have originated in some extensive bush-fires which were visible at the Fort Phillip Heads when the steamer Bosphorus left. Probable Diminution of Shipments from England.—At the latest date the July overland mail had just arrived, and the Timet of the 4th contains an abridgment of our summary. It is considered probable that the gloomy accounts of trade therein contained will materially diminish shipments, which previously had been very slowly brought forward. Freights had fallen as low as 60s to 60s per ton. Smuggling.—Charles Edward Austatt, mas ter of the vessel Charles Ferdinand, was yesterday fined £26 by II. R. Wiglev, Esq., for a breach of the Custom Laws.
