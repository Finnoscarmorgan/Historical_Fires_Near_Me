Kelly, of tee Victorian Customs Department, called upon Mr. Willis as a member of the Council of the Albany Chamber of Commerce. Messrs Howe and Kelly have been commissioned by the Government of Victoria to undertake a " commercial embassy " to India, China, and Japan. The object of the trip is set out at length in the Argus. They are to ascertain what products of Victoria can be placed on the markets of the countries they are commissioned to visit. They take with them 1(>() cases of samples including wines, preserved meats, ale, jams and preserves, biscuits, hams, brandy, soup, sauces, compressed fodder, cheese, butter, and condensed milk. It is a significant fact that the Victorian Government leaving red tape lines have determined to adopt business like measures for developing the trade of the colony. We understand that both Messrs Rowe and Kelly are both highly capable men and that they may be expected to carry out their mission in a thorough manner, it is very probable that their labors may result in benefits, uot only to Victoria but to the whole of Australia,
