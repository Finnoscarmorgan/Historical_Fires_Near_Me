TIRES IN THE SOUTH. GREAT DESTRUCTION TO PROPERTY. BITSHFIRES IS THE ECHUHGA \- i DISTRICT. Daring the past fortnight the Echunga district has been tlie scene of extensive bush fires, the effects of which hare increased in seriousness -during the last two or three days. The fire started about Wednesday, February 15—the date of opening the Glen Taggart jgoldfield-—and since then it has covered a1 ■veiy large extent of country, at least 12 or 15 j iqnare miles being ravaged by the destroying i element. Until Wednesday the fire was kept j out of the wattle country '.around Bchunga, j but then the wind swept it down from the ranges towards the Plantation Company's land, and considerable damage was done to private - properties. Mr. James Warland was the greatest sufferer, losing a large number of wattles and much wattle- bark, bnt fortunately the fire was confined to the outskirts of his farm, and his homestead escaped destruction, although outbuildings went before the flames. Mr. Kavanagh had two haystacks burnt to the ground, and Mr. Penrose and other residents sustained loss, bat no houses, we are pleased to hear, were reached by the fire. YeBterd&y; and- last night there was quite a host of hard workers engaged'in fighting the ijames, helpers coming from all the neighbor 1 ing districts, Wnd as a result of their efforts the fire: appearedto he mastered or at least kept .within bounds. At a late hour lost night it was considered that the worst was over, and the only danger feared was that a 'breeze might spring up in the morning and extend the fire-swept area.
