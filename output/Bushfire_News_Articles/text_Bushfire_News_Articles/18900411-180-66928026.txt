OUR VASSE LETTER. FFboh our Correspondent. ] BUB8EI.TON, March 31. : I regret having to. report yet ftnotber accident, which happened fcere last Thurs day evening. Mr. Gale, of Fairlawn, in endeavouring to separate two cows that were fighting, broke his right forearm. The fractured limb was afterwards set by Dr.- -Canny, who fortunately was still in Jusselton at the time, and s» far as I can learn tiie safferer ie progressing Batista c torily. - ttaater G. Leaf, of tiie telegraph office, has been very ill lately, and has also been attended by Or. Canny, who seems to be both clever and popular, and who seems to have come here just in the sick of time, when our own resident medico was absent. Mr. W. Moore, bookBeller,;of Bunbury, who had been to the Augusta and Quindalup mills, returned last Saturday, and on his way back exhibited his magic lantern at New Town. Many of the scenes were very good and made a capital treat for the ] audience, which, however, was not lar^e, many of the settlers being absent at the Bridgetown ra^s. On the following Sunday Mr. Moore, as he usually do is on his visits here, conducted a religious service. Mr. Finlayson, ef Strelley Farm, narrow ly escaped being burnt out the other day through a bushfire. Fortunately a number of Mr. Finlayson'e neighbours were at hand, and with their timely assistance the fire was prevented from doing much damage It is reported that the Messrs. Higgins, living up the Capel River, were sufferers to the extent of about £100, through a bush fire, the other week ; the principal property destroyed consisting of hay and other fodder, ete., and some outbuildings. At a meeting of the Begatta-Sports Com mittee, held on Saturday last, the majority of those present agreed to postpone the regatta and sports indefinitely. It was suggested by some to fix the Prince of Wales's Birthday for the occasion — but the time seemed rather too remote for lik ing ahead.
