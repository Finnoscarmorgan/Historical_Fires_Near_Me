COUNTRY NEWS. TENNYSON, Tuesday, Feb. 28. A good rain set in on Saturday night, and continued till nearly mid-day on Sunday, in which time 90 points of rain fell. This will enable formers to begin ploughing and pre- paring the fields for sowing. There is still a good supply of feed and water for stock, and stock generally are in good condition. This is a state of affairs that has not existed for some seasons. The harvest was a good one in this district. The average yield of wheat was between three and four bags per acre.
