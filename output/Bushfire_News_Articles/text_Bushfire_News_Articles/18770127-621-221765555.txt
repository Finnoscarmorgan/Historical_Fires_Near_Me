BUSH-FIRE AT BUNINYONG. A very extensive fire, but one which happily did not do much damage, occurred on Saturday morning at Mount Buninyong, one-half of which j was swept completely bare by the raging ele- ment, with the exception of the tall trees. The fire is supposed to have originated through the grass being set alight by a farmer named Joseph Innes, while in a drunken state. When the smoke was seen ascending in large volumes, the 1 Buninyong fire-bell was rung, and the firemen hastened with all speed towards the Mount. The mounted police of the district also put in an appearance, and, together with a couple of hundred farm labourers, succeeded in keeping the flames back from the crops. A dense I undergrowth, consisting of grass, bushes, etc., a harbour for snakes and other vermin, has been completely swept away. This is regarded on all hands as a good riddance. One or two of I the fire-fighters venturing too near the flames, I were scorched, but not seriously. Watchers were left during the night, in order to observe the progress of the fire, hut the worst was ap parently over. As night drew on the scene from Ballarat and Buninyong, and towards the back of the mount, was magnificent. From base to top the mount appeared to foe one im mense roaring sheet of flame, this terrific sight I being witnessed by a large number of people from Ballarat. On Sunday morning no signs I could be observed of the late conflagration ex cept the blackened ground, dead snakes being met with plentifully. A large number of wal labies and several kangaroos were observed flying before the fire, in which a number of them were consumed. The supposed author of the conflagration, Innes, has been arrested and lodged in the Buninyong lock-up, charged with the offence. Bail was allowed and obtained in the sum of £1,000, but so excited were the people of the neighbourhood that it was deemed pru- I dent to keep him in custody out of the way of I harm. — Ballarat Courier.
