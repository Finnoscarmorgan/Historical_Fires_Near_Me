A BUSHFIRE. At night The winds were up, and then with fourfold speed A harsh gigantic growth of smoke and fire 'Would roar along iho bottoms: in the wake Of fainting flocks of parrots, wallaroos, And 'wildered wild thiugs, scattering right and left, ., 'For safety vhguo, throughout the general gloom. Anon, the nearer hillside growing trees Would take the Burges; thus from bough to bough Was borne tho flaming terror 1 bole and spire. Rank after r,ank, now pillared, ringed, and rolled ' 'J In blinding blaze, stood out against the dead Down-smothered dark for fifty leagues nway. For fifty leagues 1 and when the winds wore strong, For fifty more ! but in tlie olden time These fires were countel ns the, harbingers, Of life-essential storms; since out of smoke And heat there cniue across the midnight ways Abundant comfort with up- gathered cl uds, And runnels babbling of a plenteous fall.
