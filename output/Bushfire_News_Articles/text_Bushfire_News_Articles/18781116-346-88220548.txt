INGLEWOOD. (FBOM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Friday, 15th November. A meeting of the committee of the North Western Agricultural Society was held yester- day at the Pelican Hotel. Present—Messrs. Klein (president), Langdon, Hill, Redwood, and Isaac. A letter was read from Mr. W. Hall, of Glenalbyn, relating to the coming field trial of reapers and binders, and it was resolved that the trial should take place on the 28th inst. A con- siderable amount of discussion took place relative to matters in connection with the late show; after which the various accounts were passed for payment, and the meeting ad- journed. The sale of Mr. Bourke's property, at Hay antni, took place yesterday, conducted by Mr. T. Morrow, auctioneer, of this town, and good prizes were realised. The land was sold to Mr. Alexander Gray at £3 2s. per acre. A large number of people were in attendance. On Wednesday next an important sale of horse stock, etc., belonging to Mr. J. Finlay, of Towimiiuil, will be held by Mr. S. Deeble, at his saleyards, Bridgewater. Full particulars appear in your advertising columns. A very pleasant change in the weather took place yesterday afternoon, caused by the wind going right round to the south, During the day some serious bushfires took place along the Taniagulla road, which did considerable damage to fencing, ote. At one timo the farms of Mr. Youughusbaud and others were in jeopardy of being swept away. Nearer to Inglewood, Messrs. Rosser and Flaherty saved their houses only by two hours of the greatest exertion. This latter danger was caused by the boys setting fire to hollow logs the previous night to burn out rabbits, and then leaving the logs alight. It is a pity some of these careless young scamps cannot be brought to justice. I learn that there is every probability of a match being arranged for the first Saturday in December between the Inglewood Cricket Club and the Bkkdigo Advertiser Club, to be played on the ground of the former.
