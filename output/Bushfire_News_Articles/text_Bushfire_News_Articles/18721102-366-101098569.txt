JUNOTION POINT. (From our correspondent.) A FEW nights ago an aurora surpassing in brllliancy that seen in Araluen a short time before the great flood ol February, 1860, was visible here, At first sight the idea suggested was that of a large bush-fire but by closely observing it, it was soon to illuminate the sky to the southward for a considerable height. the earthquake felt so extensively was also ex- perienced here by a great many of our inhabitants although not by myself, which I consider strange, as being a native of Jamaica, where earthquakes are so prevalent, I thought it almost a matter of impossi- bility that one could occur without my feeling it, which accounts for my not reporting it before. Mining.-The reef In the Royal Standard has widened out to two feet, The stone obtained in the last new shaft sunk on the Nil Desporandum is now about being tented, and all appearance will prove to be very ?. In the prospecting-shaft, sunk on the Dog-Trap by Messrs. Cunningham and party, stone of superior quality has been procured. A contract for putting down a shaft on the No. 2 Victoria has been taken. I am informed that a very wide reef has come on to in the lower tunnel of the Washington. The Stockyard continues to keep up its reputation. There are several shaft on copper-lodes being put down; but I cannot now give particulars. 28th October.
