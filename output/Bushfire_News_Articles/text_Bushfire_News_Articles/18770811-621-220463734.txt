MINING. An important and somewhat remarkable dis covery is reported as having been made at the Hodgkinson River goldfields. A curious gold- bearing lode has been found, and the extra ordinary outcrop extends for a distance of no less than eleven miles, forming the spme of a serrated ridge. The reef, strange to say, runs north-easterly and south-westerly, and, with the exception of the cross reefs at iStawell, deviates more than any known Australian i reefs from the ordinary northerly and southerly ran. Along the spine of the ridge huge oat- crops of quartz occur, which present % starifebge appearance, the contrast between the white quartz and the surrounding country, which has recently been blackened by great bush-fires, being very great. The outcrops present coarse specks of gold to the naked eye, and a crashing of fifty tons gave 2oz. to the ton.
