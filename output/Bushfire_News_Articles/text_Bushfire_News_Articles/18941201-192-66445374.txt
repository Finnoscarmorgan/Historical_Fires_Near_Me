Schofield's Siding. Since niy last report our little village bas been thrown into a state of excitement by the action of some person shooting Jack Collins' favourite saddle-horse. I did not think we had such a person in our midst, but, as the song says, " He's ail right when you know him, hut you've.got to know him first." Bush-fires are raging down here. On Monday last Mr. Rosuel's bush caught fire, and a lot of damage was done. Mr Wharton's mill is in full swing. Some 80 tracks went to market from here last week. Borne races are coming off here on the 8th December for bridles, &c.; The course | is about 160 yards from the Siding, so roll up, boys, if your reins are getting weak, or your bits worn, and put some new harness on your Carbines.
