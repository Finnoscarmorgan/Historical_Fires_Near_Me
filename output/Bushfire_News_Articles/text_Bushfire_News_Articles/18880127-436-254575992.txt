RUTHERGLEN. (FROM OUB OWN OOBBESPONDENT.) Since writing. last we hAve had a pleasant change,in the weather. Thi days considerably cooler and the nights quite cool. Up to date our district is free from bush-fires. Ooe of the poorest harvests that has been for some years is now about finished. I think the average wheat yield could be put down at seven bushels to the acre, The vine-growers . are making a fair start at the Melbourne grape.mar ket. Last Tuesday 20 tons of grapes and five tons of other fruit left the Rutherglea station. .Returns to hand vary considerably from 5s. to 16s Many make a mistake by sending unripe fruit, thinking that anything will fetch a price iu Melbourne. Last year 500 tons was sent from here, which quantity will be exceeded this year if the returns are at all favorable. The return from the Great Northern for the past fortnight was 89oz. gold. The Northern Extended Company are busy crecting machinery, which is all on the ground. Brown and Bue are still breaking good stone. We were well off for entertainments last week. Mrs rDr. Longshore gave a series of lectures in the Temperance' Hall, on Anatomy, Physiology, and the Laws of Health." The attendance at the lectures was not large, but those who did go were very well satisfied with the lady lecturer. Mr. C. H. Taylor's "Called Back Company " played to a crowded house on Friday night, and gave great satisfaction.
