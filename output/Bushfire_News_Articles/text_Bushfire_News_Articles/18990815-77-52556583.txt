RAGLAN. [From Our Own Correspondent.] A fortnight ngo the infant son of Mrs. Tiinmion was severely burnt about the feet jnnd legs through walking into a fire in the 'yard used for washing purposes. Kerie acid was applied, which soothed thc little sufferer wonderfully. Oil was subsequently j used ns a dressing, and thc little fellow is now almost recovered. I Thc limestone which is so plentiful on the resumed portion of Raglan run, oppo- site, the township, is being utilised by the Miliquin and Yengarie Sugar-refining Com pony. Under the management of Captain Cray some 200 tons of stone have been car- ted to the bank of the creek nwuiting ship- ment to Bundaberg. I Good stendy rain fell during Thursday night and yesterday. This was followed Inst night by heavy frost. A lnrgc bush-fire started to rage on the Twelve-mile on Thursday, bul fortunately thc rain coming that night prevented it doing much damage. . The weather to-day is beautifully Â«lear and bright. j Raglan, 12lh August, 1800.
