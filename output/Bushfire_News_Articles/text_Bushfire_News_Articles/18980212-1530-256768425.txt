VICTORIA. BUSH FIRES. MKLBOUIINK, February 10. Reports from Gippsland and other fire-stricken pnrts of the country show that no fnrtlic-r danger is threatened, but a heavy fall of rain is badly wanted to extinguish the smouldering fires. At a meeting of the council of the churches, held this afternoon, it was decided to invite the churches and public generally to observe next Sunday as a day of confession and prayer for rain. • An organised effort is being made by the Government and municipal officials to afford relief to the sufferers. The Government intends to grant loans to the burnt- out settlers at 3 per cent, and will not require the repayment of any portion of the capital until the lapse of .five years. The losses of individual settlers are, with few exceptions, under £500, but hundreds are penniless and destitute. The Gippsland Municipal Association has called a meeting of all the Gippsland shires at the Melbourne Town Hall for next Tuesday, when the extent and measure of the losses will be ascertained, and steps taken to give effective help. Subscriptions to the fund for the relief of the sufferers by tlio Imsli fires now amount to £7,150.
