RUTHERGLEN. (FHOM OUB OWN COBBESPONDENT.) Another old and respected resident has joined the great majority—Miss K. A. Sherry, who had passed the threescore and ten. She died on Tuesday morning last, after a long and painful illness. Her remains were followed to the Carljle cemetery by a large number of friends who respected her whilst she was amongst them. Mr. Schlue's horse bolted from the front of Mr. Hamilton's store early last lionday morning. Fortunately the wheels of the trap struck a post in front of the post office, which caused a clean capsize. With the exception of the vehicle being a little broken, no damage was.done. For the safety of pedestrians no vehicle should be left in the street without a wheel being chained. v One wheat buyer here has taken in about 6000 bags of wheat, ranging in price from 2s. 9cL to 3s, 2d. per bushel.
