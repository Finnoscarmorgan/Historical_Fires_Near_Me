AT BAIRNSDALE. The " Courier" says :-The intense heat on Saturday caused a bush fire to break out early in the morning in Mr D. Hoddinott's paddock at Forge Creek. Willing hands were soon gathered to do battle against the fire fiend, but, with the strong wind blow- ing, their labor was of little avail, and the whole country from Forge Creek to Paynesville was burnt and miles of fencing destroyed. Messrs Smith and Condon nearly lost their houses, the fire getting to within 6ft or 8ft of them before it was checked. The heaviest losers were Messrs Martin, 800 acres of grass and fencing; Condon, 8oo acres of grass and fencing; Smith, 7oo acres of grass and fencing ;and Messrs Humphrey and Brownlow. The hill on the Clifton Estate was a perfect picture on Saturday night, the burning trees resembling the lights of a city, and, although the fire had done so much harm, the sight was greatly admired by the hundreds who were parading the streets.
