Perrett addressed the class on " Has the present Premier the confid ence of the Labour party ?" Mr. Perrett spoke vely fluently on the subject, and his remarks were listened to with much attention. Mr. J. E. Kelly had charge of the question "Is the Labour member any benefi?t to the colony?" The meeting dispersed, at 9d0; after spending a very agreeable evening. The weather still keeps extremely dry, and there is no prospect, of rain. Bush-fires are raging in thesout-districts, and the atmosphere here is full of smoke, and has been so for some days past.
