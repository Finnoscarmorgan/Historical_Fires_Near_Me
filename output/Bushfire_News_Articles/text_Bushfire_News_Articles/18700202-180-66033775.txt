GINGIN. From our own Correspondent. Gingin, notwithstanding its natural re sources and beauty, its undulating- bills and valleys, its delicious stream of pure water, its rich agricultural and pastoral lands, and the many comforts it affords, the settlers are, I regret to say, in a very unsettled state, owing to a spirit of antagonism which is prevalent in the locality. Every attempt made for the benefit of the district suffers from opposition. Tbe new townsite has its opponents, and tbe Book Society and tbe Cricket Club have their opponents also. While the majority who are peacably disposed remain neutral, the mischievousuess of some and the per versity of others keep tbe place in continual confusion. It is not my desire to indulge in personalties, but certain parties may feel the truth of my statement; and if these hints do not augment but lessen the evils they are intended to correct, I shall consider myself rewarded for performing a very un pleasant doty. The Gingin hotel has been open from the beginning of the year, and, thanks to the snperior arrangements of the landlord and the vigilance of P.C. Gavin, everything goes on orderly and well, and Mr. Cockram's establishment will prove of great convenience. We are looking out for a Magistrate's visit monthly. A general store would be a boon to this place, for dealers in a small way neither benefit themselves nor those they serve. The harvest is gathered in, and yields on au average six bushels to the acre. The atmos phere ifi excessively hot, owing to the bush fires which are raging around. Jan. 29.
