MAHONGA. After a long run of hot weather it broke on Wednesday, and we had a fine night's rain, which cooled tbe air for a while. The residents of Mabong* were startled to see a great bush-fire in one of Mr. Rand's paddocks. About 20,000 acres were burned before prompt assistance could be obtained.
