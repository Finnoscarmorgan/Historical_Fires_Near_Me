CLABlS. I From our own CorresDondent.l Clare, M or ember 4. The weather last week and the beginning of this has been unusually hot for the season. Tuesday was intended to have been a holiday, in honour of the first anniversary - of the Foresters' Club, or Court iHclhauin, but the disagreeableness of the weather rendered the demonstration a comparative failure. A most excellent dinner provided for 100 persons had to be enjoyed by 30 only, who, how ever, did full justice to the viands set before them by Host Oronin, of the Commercial HoteL At night a ball was given in the Clare Hall. The rain that fell during the night of Wednes day was one-fifth of an inch. It has freshened the gaidens a little, hut the hot winds following the frosts have done great damage. On Tuesday evening, October 31, a report of a bushfire, extending itself towards Clare, set the inhabitants on the alert. The fire was discovered to be in Mr. March's paddock, and was soon ex tinguished.
