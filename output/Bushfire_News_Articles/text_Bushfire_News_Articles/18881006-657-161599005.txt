SANDY CREEK. [from our own correspondent.] Just a tow lines trom tlrrs part of the country for your popular little paper. An accident happened to Mr. W. F. Fitzgerald, J.P., through being thrown out of his buggy, and reciving such in juries as to cause death. Tlris is the second acciden that has occurred here lately, Mr. I. B. Keys losing one of his children through the capsize of a waggonettee. The weather is much pleasantel' since the late fall ot rain, and the grass is coming up well, but we want a great deal more for the crops, and to fill the dams and creeks. If we do not get more rain, and the weather keeps dry, the grass will soon be missing again, and I am afraid there will not be much wheat about. More rain would also save the potato and maize crops, and assist the gardens. Everything seems to be slack for the want the refreshing showers of rain. Some of the farmers are busy putting down wells. This is a wise precaution, and if carried out on a more extensive scale would save much of the perishing stock. We have had some bush-fires lately, but the showers of rain have prevented their progress, and it is to be hoped that these troubles are at an end. I notice that the Road Superinten dent has pegged out several places on the Sandy Creek road, for repairs, and I suppose teders will be called for the work to be done.
