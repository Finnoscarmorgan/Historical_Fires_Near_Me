? A relief fond has been started by the townspeople for the assistance of those dairymen who had their holdings destroyed by bosh fires on Sunday last. The damage is now ascertained to be •Bornons, a tract of aeven miles in length by three in breadth having been laid • ' waste. Orer 10.000 acres of grass and many miles of fencing were consumed, about 30 dairymen being rained. Their houses were saved from destruction, but tlie r means of livelihood is gone, as cattle have to be sold at nominal prices to p-erent starvation. 'It is proposed to apply the fund now being raised to the purchase of fencing wire.
