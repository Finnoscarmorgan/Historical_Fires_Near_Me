NORTHAM. From our own Correspondent. On the whole, the weather has been very hot during the week, having been augmented by several bushfires in various directions throughout the district. One was occasioned last Wednesday on the Grass Valley estate, by a dead tree having been struck and set on fire by lightning. On Tuesday evening last, a terrific wind passed over the town blowing a thick cloud of dust along â€” so thick that a house two chains off could not be discerned. Trees, in all directions, were torn up, haystacks were upset, and the galvanised roofing was partly taken off of a house. On Saturday week last, a number of our local athletes, including Messrs. Lockyer brothers, Sermon and Driscoll, left by rail for Perth, to take part in the sports of the W.A. Eight Hours Association on Monday. The company in which they had to run, was too good for them, apparently, as none of them obtained a place in the Sheffield Handicap in which they all competed. It is to be hoped that they will make a better show at the Greenhills Annual Sports, which take place on the 12th inst. Mr. James Byfield's Roller Flour Mill will soon be completed, and will be of inestimable value, not only to Northam, but to all the Eastern Districts. It is the intention of the owner to celebrate the opening with a dinner, to which the lead ing residents of the Eastern Districts, Perth, and Fremantle, will be invited. The now store of that energetic firm Throssell, Son and Stewart, will also be finished and furnished throughout, in a few weeks. It is a great improvement on our local architecture, and is undoubtedly an orna ment to our busy little town. The Convent building too, the foundation stone of which was laid by His Lordship the Bishop, some few months ago, will be ready for the good Sisters of St. Joseph about the close of this month. It is a magnificent structure second to none in the town. February 3rd.
