MINING INTELLIGENCE. GOLD. Batman's Company.—The captain reports to the following effect: —'" The works on the mine are carried on with persevering energy. The .black leader last reported on has been traced a considerable distance to the north west, and I have started a shaft, which is now down 22 feet, logged up, and windlass fixed. We _ have cut- four leaders, from 2 to 6 inches big, at about 12 feet from surface, going down, increasing in size as depth is ob tained, and underlaying, to the east. The black reef is going down perpendicular, which I expect will make to the reef, and from the auriferous nature of the stone something good may be expected. ... There has been an exten sive bush-fire. If it had not been for the prompt assistance we received, the whole of the buildings might have "been consumed, but for tunately the galvanized iron saved them. The blacksmith's shop caught, but' we put it out with buckets of water. The logging of the shaft was all in a complete blaze; fortunately the powder was in the 30 feet level of the main shaft. The only damage done was burning an. axe and shovel-handle.
