PARKES. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Monday, November 1. The new water works were opened on Monday last by Mr. Young, Minister for Works, who, in company with a number of Government supporters, including Messrs R. T. Ball, T. Brown, and T.Cotton, M.P's., at the invitation of tho council, visited Parkes on the occasion. Mr. Young and party were given a banquet at night, at which some ex cellent speeches, chiefly dealing with the fiscal policy of the country, were made. On Saturday evening a fire broke out in the stables belonging to Mrs. Blamey's Club House Hotel, and it was not until the build ing was totally destroyed that the flames could be extinguished. Had it not been for the prompt action of the fire brigade adjacent buildings would have caught the flames, and far more serious damage would have been caused. The crops in this district are, on account of the scattered rains that have fallen during the last month, very variable. In some places the wheat is 5ft. high, and expected to yield five to six bags per acre, while in others the late sown is not 1 foot high and parching up. Grass is abundant, and bush-fires will have to be guarded against during the summer. The weather at present is dry with rain threatening.
