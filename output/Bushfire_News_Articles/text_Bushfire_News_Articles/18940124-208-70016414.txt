Summer has set in properly now; over 100.degrees in the shade on Sunday. In a week or so more the bushfires will com- mence, and no doubt will be very bad .indeed, as the grass is exceptionally long and thick. A boy, only 4½ years old, son of Mr. Head, was lost ii the swamp on Tuesday evening, 16th inst, and up to now there have been no tidings of him. The black trackers and search parties have been out every day, but cannot find even a trace or mark. A few of the residents have a very de- cided idea that there is gold in the To- muc Valley flats, and I believe it is their intention to get a diamond drill and give some of the valleys here a trial. It is to he hoped they will strike something pay- able. I am informed the fancy poultry breed- ers around Pakenham have some young stock coming on that will make the pro- fessional exhibition around Melbourne "sit up" this year. I notice the Minne- haha poultry farm has a consignment on 'board the Australasian" from the best yards in England. Great disatsfaction is felt throughout this district by the action of one of the trustees of the Mornington Farmers' So- iety in blocking the way of holding a show this year. They think it is a most contemptable action on his part to make the public suffer because he has some jealously with others who are work- ing tooth and nail to make it a success. At a meeting held some time ago to test the question of removing the show yards to Berwick. it was carried that they be so removed, although the Narree VWarren folk fought hard against it. I believe a gentleman offered a site free near the station, but if I remember rightly he. made.a promise some time ago of £20, and by all accounts it is still on promise. No wonder the committee did not jump at his last gift. No sign of the child lost in the swamp. The search parties are still at work, but without sucess.
