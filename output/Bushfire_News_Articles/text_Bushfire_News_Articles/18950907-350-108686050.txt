Katoomba ITews. (BY OUR CORRESPONDENT.) There were no cases at (be local Police Court this week. There is considerable damage being done around here with the winds and the fires that are raging on the ridges all around, presenting a very pretty sight at night-time. The catapult nuisance is raging here just now, and several windows have been broken and people just missed being hit. It would be advisable for the owners to burn them, as the police have determined to make an example of the first person they see using | one. The new Oourt-house is proceeding very slowly towards completion. It was ex pected the contractors would have handed it over weeks ago. To make matters worse,. the wind, which has been blowing hurricane rate of late? blew the new fence down on Wednesday night, and the public say it was I a great pity the whole ot the unsightly six feet paling fence facing the township, whioh has been placed there, had not blown away altogether, as it should have been a nice picket fence to show the building off, instead of hiding it as it now does.
