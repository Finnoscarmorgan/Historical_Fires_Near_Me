BUSH FIRES IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT. (BY TELEGRAPH FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) CAMPERDOWN, FRIDAY. The flames of an apparently very extensive bush are beyond Lake Colongulac have been visible from here. No particulars have yet come to hand, but so far as can be judged from what was seen here the fire seems to have started towards sundown this evening in the direction of the Westbank Estate ; and as a strong wind was blowing towards the east, it rapidly spread to the Koort Koortnung Station, and came close to Chirn- side's homestead. It traversed the eastern Cloven Hill, and crossing the road, entered Coles's estate, and soon enveloped Western Cloven Hill. At one time a face of flame some eight or 10 miles in length was plainly visible, stretching from west to east, Its depth from north to south cannot be at present estimated, but it is thought not to extend far in those directions. Details can- not be obtained before to-morrow. The fire appeared to be burning from 6 o'clock this afternoon until 9 to- night, and few signs of it are now visible, so that it has apparently beau subdued. The rate at which it travelled westward was something marvel- lous, and as the country over which it passed is all plain, covered with long dry grass, its speed is hardly to be wondered at. A strict watch will be kept to- morrow, and should it again break out, organised assistance will be sent from Camperdown.
