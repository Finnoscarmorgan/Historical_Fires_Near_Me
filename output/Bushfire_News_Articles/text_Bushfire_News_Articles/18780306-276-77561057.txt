?w 11 -* ? ? KINGSTON. " I .' (From our own Coneapondent.) t March .2. c ' The' Surveyor-General, accompanied by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, Sassed through here en route for Adelaide uring the -w;eek. They. were, entertained at theRoyal Mail Hotel by a (deputation from the District Council and several in fluential members of our community. Several complaints have of late been made on account of the irregularity ex isting in the conveying of parcels between here and Mount Gambier,' but it is not clear whether the fault lies with the railway authorities or mail contractors.: We are sure it needs only to be mentioned to be remedied. During the week a parcel of English magazines for Messrs. Watson and Wedd was .detained at . Narracoorte for some cause as yet un known, which must have greatly incon venienced, not only the members of that firrn, but likewise the subscribers to the different periodicals, who were no doubt anxiously waiting,the arrival of the mail. The parcels arriving from Mount Gambier, which are often detained, are of still more importance. They are, for the greater part, from Dr. Jackson, who, I am convinced, has as many patients in Kingston as in any place of its size, the detention of whose parcels are often at tended with serious results. It is to be hoped some remedy will be adopted to in future prevent such inconveniences. I hear a movement is on foot to memorialise the Postmaster-General to alter the arrival and departure of the mails. I have not seen the memorial, but amongst other clauses am informed that it proposes to lessen the time wasted on the road between Milang and Mount ?? Gambier-a-grievance complained of by nearly every one travelling this route. We have had very hot weather of late, ?which has been rendered more so by the quantities of bushfires in the neighbour hood.
