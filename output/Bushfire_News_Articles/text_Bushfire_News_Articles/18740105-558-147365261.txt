DEYSDALE. I (from our own correspondent.) Saturday. January 3rd. Another large bush-fire is burning near Drysdale, and appears to be gradually drawing near the township. It is now burning between Drysdale and Grass-tree Hill. ' A meeting is called for "Wednesday evening next for appointing trustees for the land set apart for racing and recreation purposes at Drysdale. I hear that Messrs Humble and Co. have come to the rescue, and will at once supply Mr Inglis, ; of Drysdale, with another threshing machine, so that he will not lose so much , time as, no doubt, the incendiary who was the cause of the destruction of his â–  other being burnt intended he should do.
