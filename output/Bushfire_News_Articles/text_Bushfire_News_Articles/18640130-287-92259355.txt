KAPUNDA. [Correspondent] Jsnuaiy £3. The bush-fire 1 mentioned in my last was not on the Julia Creek, as stated, but in the neighbourhood of Mr. Abraham White's, and Mr. Gillow's, on the Light. An inquest was held yesterday at the latter gentleman's residence, by Mr. J. S. Brovt£, S.M., Coroner, and a respectable jury, of whom Mr. O. White was foreman, to enquire into itB origin. After a great many witnesses had been examined, the Jury returned a verdict ^d -the effect, ' that how the fire originated was unknown.' This is. I am informed. the fourth fire that has taken ple?e in that distiict, and on the last occasion had not the conflagration been extinguished when it was, it muBt in a few ^ minuteB have reached Mr. White's wheat paddock, when the result must have been disastrous, and, pro bably, the whole neighbourhood would have been one mass of conflagration. Messrs. Wbit9 and Gk-odet:ld :nt8ud offeiirg 10,000 bushels of wheat for sale t3-moi?ow by auction, which is rather a novel proceeding for tb'S place, but is likely that there will be much com petition, as there are several wheatbuyers established here, irrespective of those who attend on Satu-day's to purchase for firms in other places. The weather is all that can be desired for the farmers to enable them to reap their crops advan tageously, but it will be some time before the whole are gathered. Owing to the farmers being thus employed the quantity of wheat coming to market is not eo large as it was' a few days' sines. The prices to-day are — Wheat, 4s. per bushel ; oats, from 5s. to 6s. do. ; barley, 2s. 6d. do. Flour, £12 per ton.
