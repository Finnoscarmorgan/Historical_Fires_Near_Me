THE WEATHER. I he following is the oiheuu record of temperature during, the past week, sup plied from the Melbourne Observatory : — " The weather at the beginning of last week was very fine and pleasant, with a cool gentle breeze from S.W., but on the ISth it became hot and sultry, and each succeeding day, with a cloudless sky, the heat became more intense, and with the thick haze and smoke from bush-fires' more oppressive, until at eleven a.m. on the 22nd the wind went round from north to S.W., which reduced the temperature in . ten minutes from 101.8 to 76.0, and was followed during the .evening by light rainahowera. The five days from Monday, the ISth, to Friday, the 22nd, is the period of greatest heat recorded in Melbourne, the average temperature for the twenty-four hours on the 18th having been 76.2; 19th, 83.4; 20th, 94.0; 21st, 93.7 ; 22nd, 84.0 ;. giving an average for tho five days of 56. 3 ; while the highest five-day average on record only reaches 80.9, from 6th to 10 th January, 1872\. The daily averages on the 20th and 21st were also the highest on record, viz., 94.0"and 93.7 respectively ; 91.3 being the maximum on 14th January, 1862, on which daythftabsolute maximum recorded since 1858 occurredrviz.j-lll.R_ The lowest tem- porature, 50. K whs ' recorded -on., theearly morning of thql7th- The- highcctjreading- of. the barometer, 29.9S8, occurred onr the evening of the.23rd, with light S.W. breeze;,, the lowest, _ 29.584, on the' afternoon ; of the 21st, with a- strong hot north wind. Rain fell to the amount of 0.17 inches, making the total rainfall since the beginning of the year 057 inches. Mr. Groves continues to publish his Weather Guide. That for 1875 we have just received from the publishers. Mr. Groves' prognostications and Mr, Ellery's tables do not correspond very accurately, however. The folio wing may be taken as in stances of this 19th January, 1875 — Groves : . Strong breeze, . Ellery : Fine, clear, hot. 20th January — Groves: Brisk wind. Ellery: Hot, cloudless, thick haze. 21st — Groves : Moderate and fine. Ellery Fine, haze, very hot. 22nd — Groves : Strong wind, inclined to thunder and rain. Ellery: Fine, cloudless, and very hot, 23rd — Groves : Strong breeze. Ellery : Fine, cloudless, and very hot. 24th — Groves : Moderate and fine. Ellery : Fine and very, hot. 25th— Groves : Moderate and -fine, Ellery : Overcast and cool. 26th — Groves : Fresh and showery. Ellery : Fine, cloudy, ; and. cool. 27th — GrovcB; Moderate aiid fine. Ellery : Fine and overcast. These samples are enough to show the value of the prognostications. The Benditjo Independent states that Wed nesday morning broke with fierce heat, and the sun rose more like a ball of fire than anything else, and all. flay the rays were ob scured by dense smoke, apparently arising from a ring of bash fires all round Sandhurst. To give an idea of the density of the atmos phere thus smoke-laden, itmay be stated that from the Black Swan corner the tower of the City Family Hotel was only mistily percep tible, and tho ranges at the rear of Back Creek were shrouded from view by a blue haze. It was said early in the day that tho Whipstick scrub was again on fire, and it is highly probable that such is tho case. Up to Wednesday, 27th inst., says the Star, the total number of deaths registered inBallarat West for the month of January was 55 ; of this number 25 were caused by measles. During December the number of deaths was 28. In Ballarat East tho mortality appears to have been greater' than this for the month of January, 60 deaths haying been registered up to the 27th inst. The births during tho same period numbered 31\. Last week the deaths there numbered 25\. Out of the 60 deaths which have oc curred, 50 are said to have been caused by measles, the remainder being caused by diphtheria, erysipelas, peritonitis, diarrhcea, jaundice, consumption, brain fever, scarla- tina, asthma and premature birth. In the same district, from the 1st January, 1874, to 31st December, 1874, the deaths num bered 209.
