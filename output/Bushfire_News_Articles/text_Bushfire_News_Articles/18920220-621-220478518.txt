MISCELLANEOUS Bush -Fires. AVOCA. Extensive bush fires are raging at Elm- hurst and Middle Creek. At the former place thev have destroyed 6,000 acres of grass, and at the latter they are raging over an area of six miles, and have destroyed 10 miles of fencing, also sheep and other stock. Every effort has been made to prevent this loss, but without success. BRIGHT, Tuesday. On Wednesday last a farmer named Robinson, of Wandiligong, had a narrow escape of losing his house and out-buildings through a bush fire, which was only stayed through the united efforts of a number of men. Messrs. E. M. Rollason and James Manfield, of Porepunkah, have lost several miles of fencing and the whole of their grass. Many similar losses are also reported. CASTLEMAINE, Tuesday. The Ravenswood estate, recently purchased by Dr. Atkinson, of Bendigo, appears to be unfortunate in the matter of fires. Only a few months since an extensive con- flagration took place there, and this afternoon, shortly before sundown, another very serious fire occurred. The flames were first seen from an eminence on the eastern side of the railway line, midway between Harcourt and Elphinstone. The flames spread with great rapidity, and within an hour or so about 300 acres were ablaze. The heavy timber, fed by rank under- growth, caught quickly, and to-night burning trees and dead timber on the heights of Mount Alexander presented a grand but fearful spectacle. The wind carried the fire into dangerous proximity to the railway, but owing to the vigilance of gangers, so far no damage has been done to the line. It is surmised that the fire was due to the heat influence on phosphorised grain laid for rabbits. For several days past bush fires have been raging at Glenluce, a farming district some 15 miles south of Castlemaine. It was reported to-night that hundreds of acres of grass, with a large quantity of tim- ber and fencing, had been destroyed.
