TnK WOODCAKTEBS. I hops to tiud that owing to the action taken by the wood carters, and with the assistance of our members, the silly measure of locking up the dead v^ood in the Creswick forest from the carters aftd splitters will be stopped, so the-fircwood ring cannot, if such was their intention, benefit at the expense of the consumer by the little move. No doubt we ought to look after our forests, and hare wholesome laws to preserve the young growing timber, as is done in other countries. Russia, for instance, is called "thelsnd of everlasting forests"—a title simply due to her wise furest laws, from which it may not be too late to learn a -wriukle. It takes about eighty years for the trees to reach maluvity, so every forest is divided into eighty parts, each part as it arrives at maturity being cut down every year to be fresh planted and let stand another eighty y-ars. By this means they have timber in every stage of development. But if wc want goad forests in the future, we muBt not only protect but assist Nature now. It is, however, the height of absurd cruelty to suddenly stop a number of hard-working carters aud splitters utilising the dead wood lying on the ground. It is far better for it to be burnt in our fireplaces than by bush-fires. I have known a district where there was not a stick of standing timber, and yet on this being suddenly proclaimed a forest, the various families were hindered from chopping the stumps before their doors, and as tliey were getting their living'by splitting, they were obliged to remove in great misery " to seek fresh fields and pastures new." This is idiotic administration. It is neither Liberalism nor Conservatism, for true Conservatism is conserving what ought to be conserved, that is the sound gruwicg timber, and removing what ought to be removed, the fallen dead timber and decaying rubbish. But, unfortunately for humanity nowadays, Conservatism goes in fur destroying the good and preserving'the bad. •
