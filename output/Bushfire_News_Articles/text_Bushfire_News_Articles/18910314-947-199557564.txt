The Warden, in a few appro priate rsmarks. formally opened tho fair, and then business commenced in ;' real earnest. The room was tastefully draped,' a large amount of labour and: artistic. taste was displayed in arranging the flower stall, amd the stalls of fancy and needlework were well furnished, and did a good trade.'''The refreshment room, held in the adjoining school-room', was well patronised, and con tained all the usual niceties usually found oh such tables. - The vegetable stalls were also well supplied,and found ready buyers. Baffling started' early,' and the various articles went off at - extreme figures. The sale of Btock on the second day pissed off well, and our local auctioneer, wielded the hammer as if he had been trained to the work.- The rooms were crowded during the day, and in the evening there was hardly standing room. -This, I believe, is the first thing of the kind ever' attempted' in Boss, and from what I hear it will be thepopulai way of raising money. ?

Our FUnders Island correspondent writes under date February 18.:— A re markable fall of rain took place here on January 31. It started at 2 o'clock a.m., and lasted till 4-20 a.m. During that two hours and 20 minutes all the lower portions of Green Island were entirely covered with water, and thousands of young mutton' birds in the rookery were destroyed through being suffocated in the holes, and at present it would be a difficult matter to get a hundred young birds there: People living in the Strait3 for years have not witnessed the like before, and describe it' as' a 'water spout.' On Chappie Island, the damage done to the young birds was enormous, and people here with large families, who are almost dependent on the' mutton birds for an existence; will feel the' loss very much. Strange to say the other islands about seem to ' have suffered little or nothing by the downfall. ';? \; ' ' ; !

Gladstones, were spending a part of the winter in Florence, and the King of Italy, hearing of this, dispatched a Court Cham berlain' from Borne specially to conduct them over the private living apartments of the' Pitti Palace, which are inaccessible to the vulgar tourist. In tb« banqueting hall of thePalace the GHadstonian party, which, un like that in the House of Commons, was a large one, was shown a unique gold dinner service wrought by Benvenuto Cellini in his prime. Tha pieces were handed round1 for loving:, admiration, and to the delight of all present it began to be whispered about that Mr. Gladstone (who is a thorough master of the subject) would favour .them with a short discourse on the' history arid merits of the. work. Ttey' gathered - close: around him, and in dead silence the Court Chamberlain handed him' the great central rose- water dish,, which he : wiw to uso'by! way of text.

'' !' i ' '.The' coining ; billionaire!' ia.;. for the .moment the. great, object of speculative ;curiosity in. the United States, and the' only, question is. when ; will .he come,;, and. what effect ; will- his ? coming have on society. Millionaires are already (says the Daily News), beginning; :-to .pass unnoticed. There- are believed -to. be at. least a hun ;dred of them. .Seventy American estates are known to average 35,000,000dol each,and only, last year, -by- the consolidation of two estates, asingle citizen has become worth — to-use the good old-fasshioned phrase which smacks . so strongly v;oC the worship of Plutus— at least .£200,000,000. When it is considered: that large estates have a ten dency ; to t»row - much faster than small ones; and: that even at the present moderate rates of interest it would take only another 40 years to convert a fortune of .£200 000,000 by; mere investment and xe-in vestment into a billion, it is evident that the advent of the billionaire is no very remote possibility; j When he comes there will probably be many half-billionaires, and still more probably a very large number' . who count their dollars bythe hundred thousand. Well may Mr Shear man, who discourses on this theme in the Forum, express anxiety regarding the power which such enormous wealth must confer on individuals.-.. The cure, according to this authority, is to be found in abolishing the present mode of raising revenue, which is regardfid as unduly favouring tho wealthy, and substituting a system of direct taxation. One of the latest BUggestiPns as a solu- , tion of the platinum mystery is that Mr Pound deceived himself into the belief that the rocklrbm the Otway Proprietary Company's 'mine contained the precious metal,' and !that he dreamed like the ancient alchemists of being able to trans fuse metals.' .Meantime, ^and pending legal prpceedirige, Mr, Pound declines- to - give any explanation'to the press.
