At the Coachmaker's. [WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.] (Concluded from last week.) BY MARY HANNAY FOOTT. " I am so slow," said the bullock-dray, " that if I undertook to tell anything of a story it would be weeks before we came to the end of it. So perhaps the best thing I can do is just to tell a little about my own family and then a little about our friend Jack Winter.!' " Our friend!" exclaimed the basket-carriage, the victoria, and the coach, all at once. "Do you know him too ?" ••Well," replied the bullock-dray, "con sidering that we travelled for-days together and camped together for weeks after that, I think I may say I know him as well as meet folks do. I wiU:teHyouaU aboutk." : -All .the. company ..were much surprised at hearing this, and awaited With eager, curiosity .  The Sto-x Told bt th*. Bci<tocic-v --Y. ..." We bad a selection about 800 miles weat.of here, but nearly all the cattle perished in the long drought., Thau a bush-fire look all our fencing,and .even the^hut itself. Luckily the team and myself were saved, so.Dave li'Millan (our owner) went fencing for a bit till he, had saved enough to buy another .team arid a: waggon—'The, Star of. the Weat'my mate's name is, and mine is '.The, Pride of. the ,paroo."' : .-..'.:■.:/.*•• '•'.;,..:.. .-..... ..

Marianne was "as good ns a boy to her father. She would fetch up the bul locks of a morning, and ride, all 'day alongside the second team ho as to keep them up to their work. And she knew how to make theui travel too !—nearly as well as Dave himself. ; "Our living wasn't got by fencing any mora after we bought the Star. We went ou the . roads —carrying, you know." ".Do you mean that Mr. M'Millan became a carrier?" inquired the little basket-carriage politely, anxious to understand the story aright. " Yes, ma'am," replied the bullock-dray, " we took loading to stations, and selections, and to gold-mining places. We carried wire, and flour, and sugar, and jam, and boots, and trousers, and saddles, and tobacco, and—and gvog." " What is grog?" inquired the victoria. " Grog is horrid things to drink," said the sociable, forgetting, in her eagerness to be obliging, that it is not good manners to reply to a question put to some one else. " The roan horse told me so," sho added. "He says that grog is at the bottom of many a bad smash." " Some months ago," said the bnllock-dray, resuming his story, "we had loading on—the Star and me—for Reefer's Rises Irom a town on the Downs. It was in winter, and the nights were very cold and frosty. One evening we came to a small township on the bank of a river, and we found that there had been" heavy rains up above, and that the water was so high at the ford that we could not cross. Dave turned out the bullocks, and helped the missus and the baby down from tho spring cart. The youngsters jumped out after her, and scuttled about gathering sticks for the tire. Marianne let go Punch and Blossom. Nanny, the brown goat, skipped about in great glee, tearing off the fresh shoots of the saplings, and devouring them as fast as she could. And Joey, the parret, hopped to and fro in his cage, pioking berries from the bush on which it hung, and screaming for joy. By-and-by, whet supper was nearly ready, Marianne discovered that some one had made a ferry over the ford by stretching a wire across the river from a tree on our 9ide to one on the opposite bank, then attaching a half tank to the wire by means of some hobble-rings, so that people could pull themselves over. Marianne no sooner found out this than she rushed down to the river and got into the tank to cross to the other side and back again by way of amusomont. When sho had pulled half-way aorots, a young fellow, car rying his swag, came down the track from the township as if he were making for the ford. Just as he was within a few yards of the river bank down went the boat and Marianne with it. It had heeled over, filled with water, broken away from the hobble-rings, and sunk to the bottom of the river. Dave set off at full speed to try and rescue Marianne, kicking off his boots as he tore along, with the missus and all tbe little youngsters running after him, screaming as loud as they could bawl. But the young fellow was bcfoie him, and, Hinging off his swag, he plunged into the water and saved onr Marianne. The missus threw her arms round his neck and kissed him, and Dave shook hands with him, and all the little young sters put a finger in their mouths and stare 1 at him with all their might. Then they marched him up to tho camp and into the calico tent. And when he came out of it he was dressed in a clean flannel shirt of Dave's and a pair of his white moleskin trousers and the missus's best boots. Then they all had supper, and after that the young fellow travelled to Reefer's Rises with Dave and us all. When we got there and the loading was delivered the bullocks needed a spell. While they were spelling Dave and the young fellow went prospecting together in tbe scrub about the Rises, and one day they found a reef which made both their fortunes. Dave doesn't mean to part with the Star and me. He is going to lend us to an old mate of his. the missus's brother, who is down on his luck. But before we go on the roads -with him we are to be painted up and have our names done over with freßh gold. That is the Star over there in the corner—fast asleep. I forgot to tell you the name of the young fellow who pulled Marianne out of the river, and helped her father to find the Big Reef. It is—what do. you think?— Jack Winter!" "And you feel certain that your Jack is ours?" inquired the Victoria. ♦'Quite certain, ma'am," replied the bullock dray. •' Irhearfl him tell all aboutthe missing: -SOOO-to Dave and the nriss-s one night liyytHe, fire." ..• "What became of Punch and Blossom?" . inquired' the sociable. ' • The - roan horse- will never forgive me if I cannot tell him thai," *' And Marianne ?" suggested tbe little basket carriage, •>- and the others ?" " Pray do fell us," entreated the Victoria. "I am quite interested m Marianne, Does, she go, to Bchool now ?" "Yes, ma'am," replied the••;bullock-dray, , "and from all I hear she is,ono of the smartest girls.there.: She 5b learning ; to ploy the piano, .too, and whcn.Bhc is in full swing it heats all thefbullock-beris I ever, heard.' The youngsters go to school as well—all but the baby—and the niis'sris has "nothing to do but drive out ih the; ' httggy with.

Dave wanted'to buy a pair pf smart, young hOffies, but. the: missus ahook her head audi said, 'Give me old friendsf So.she had her. way; as 'she generally doe's. The brown goat \- lias two little kids, and "the parrot" has. learnt: :io say, • Ha, Marianne f "Who got a duckirvg?"! "The thing that puzsle6 me," remarked the doctor's buggy," is how on earth Marianne arid the young fellow got 'over it; and" no' medical, raatK-i'suppose,'witbm scores of miles-." _*■ i '*• Thalnkb so much for your story r'-exclafnjiedi the victoria-.

T -■ -;•■■■■ " ■•■.•■."••...: < Tab Stout Toltj nt the Coach.' " Ouv friend, the bullock-dray, has lightened my. burden 11 good deal for me, and-1 am glad of it, for it is (retting on for .'sunrise, and none of us have.had our fair night's, sleep. I knew all about the Big Reef, and meant to .cll'you of Jack Winter's luck, but nB you have already heard of that I will start from the day he left Reefer's Rises with me to return to town., Wo* had four insides—a young schoolmistress, who was coming down for ner'holidays; a. sick, miner, bound for the hospital; a Chinese cook, going home to the Flowery Laud to live on hl» little savings; and an elderly official employed bj Jack's old bank, who was bringing down a lot of gold bought at the Rises. Bob (my driver) was,- of coarse, on the box. Jack Winter was seated at Bob's left hand. We had a team of four, fit and fresh. " All went well till we came to the middle of the Ten-mile Scrub. Then two fellows dashed out of the timber, and rode alongside us. They pointed revolvers at Bob, and mado him pull up the horses. The next thing they did was to tell the banker that he must hand over his gold. What was the poor man to do but obey? The scoundrels rode off with their booty, but no sooner were their backs turned than Jack Winter and our Bob, after a few words with one another, took out the horses and rode the-leaders off bareback in pursuit of the robbers. The reason, I have since heard, why they did not resist the robbery was that they feared, if they did so, the young schoolmistress and the sick mirier might bo frightened or hurt. Our two heroes were away for some time, and everybody was very anxious about them, but by-and-by they once more emerged from the scrub. They hail not been wasting their time—that was easily to be seen! Not only did they rclurn with the stolen treasures, but they brought with them also the men who had taken it. After this the horses were restored to me, and we started once more on our journey. Only the young schoolmistress now sat on the box-seat beside Boh, and the twobushranyciS—very much cast down by thoir misfortunes—-joined the little company of inside*. Ah soon as we got to the next township they were handed over to the police, and the rest of us continued our jour ney in pence. When we drovo into town we had another advontmo whioh the victoria has already told you of—the time when Jack saved Miss Angela and her aunt. One of my axles is cracked —that is why lam here. Bob knew of it at the Rises, but he said he thought he would chance it for another journey rntlier thin have to wait there while it was mending. lam very glad he did so—though at the time I thought hiiii foolhardy—since my stay here has 1< d to my making so many never-to-be-forgotten friends." As the coach uttered theac last words he looked fondly towards tho little basket- carriage She smiled in return nnd said : " Thank yoa.' Good night." All the others echoed her words, although instead of " Good night" they might well have said " Good morning." Early in the follow'*i3 day a group of happy friends met at the coachmnkcr's. The mat to arrive was Bob the driver, came to see about the cracked n*c!c. Jack Winter appeared a minute alter wit'i G:-ay Fairy to fetch home his mother's litf tc basket-carriage. The two men shook hands heartily, and Bob remarked: •' They've come down handsome have t'io bank. I'll liny IV.c old coach if they'll sell anl take over tho mail contract.*' •« Just then Aunt Se'iua came nit? t'io yard. She was er.eited and tearful, but ber tesrs were tears of joy. ••Jack!" she exclaimed, "I have been to your mother'n, and she told me v\:cre to find you, for I ould not wait. You ni".:t come to the bank at once—at once. My brother wants to go down on his knees 15 you. And ho do 1. Those dreadful ponies ! I love them after all!" •' Very forgiving of you!" said Jack laughing. •* Forgiving ? No! They have behaved far better than I have done! For I know vow -that it wan I who lost that money, Jack. But they have found it t" '•Found the £6000?" inquired Jack. " The ponies?" " Yes, indeed they have," replied Aunt Selina. "It was only yesterday. My brother had them brought out of the stible to be Bhown to someone who spoke of buying them. They broke away from the groom, pranced all over the garden (frightening my poor canaries most terribly), broke • down tlie great laurel bush, and—there w&b; the missing money 1 M And then Jack' harnes«'ed Gray Fairy to. tho little basket-varria^c, and' he and Aunt Selina drove away together. ———»——.———.———,———.———— —i—___——■j» . . . ' . . ■.... - . ,' i . -. ' *' Mr. Arthur Kavanagh, the armless and leg less gentleman, who sat for sevbral yean in Parliament, died on Christmas morning (soya the Social Gossip correspondence of the Mcl : bourne i Argus)." He came of an ancient kingly family in. Ireland, and hia property hod descended to hun in right line horu.father to son, from a period before Sirpngbow's con quest.' Hia deiorniity wa* ascribed by the people to the late fulfilment of a. curse pro nounced by a fairy who had been left but of a christening party. It was prophesied that the property would- oafs to and. pass away with an a-auleaa and legless heir. Other children are said to. have been born in the family; with these deficiencies, but.they were never the holders of the property ; and the late Mr. Kavanagh was not the.eldest son. of.his parents, hub the eldest son was burnt to death owing to his night fshk\\. r catching Axe whilst. he was shaving, saiAt .tho . truncated heir, thus came into possession .at last fi ''..' The; property Juts not passed..,awaywithhim, for he - leaves three ; shapely [and .perfect; children; but most ..of.-- its. profits may- be supposed to luyve disappeared, judging by the. fact that he has died in a mean* square, mostly, com posed of lodging-hpuses, oS the High-street, Kensington. .. Mr, Kavanagh afforded a rare example of courage in refusing, to eubmit to the disabilities, which nature had seemed to impose. He, [had travelled,.extensively, even on camel-back. HefWaa a fair shot (being carried on a man's she^ders and firing his gun by a special maohmery-) r; , He was an enthusiastic yachtsman, and.had Qualified as a ••master" in the. merchant service. With a bifj head,, a rugged countenance, and a gruff voice, he was, nevertheless, an agreeable and instructive companion. When in the Houso he was a frequent speaker on Irish, affairs, and after he lost his seat he devoted his very con siderable business- powers to one and another of the variouß' landlord organisations which have been formed to resist the Irish land move ment. He . lived to he 58, and. there is no doubt that hia death was accelerated' by an oppressive sense of the misfortunes and" de cadence of the class to which he belonged.
