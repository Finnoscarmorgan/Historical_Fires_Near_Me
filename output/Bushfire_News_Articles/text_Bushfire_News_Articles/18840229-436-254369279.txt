BOWNA. Beautiful Nature has once more favored our district with a little of tbe precious fluid, and a delightfully cool change has taken place. The rain, as everybody knows, was most welcome, and weather prophets predict that there is more to follow. The bush-fire which was raging so terribly last Sunday week has, I think, been quite extinguished. A most eventful part of tbe year for tbis village is again drawing nearâ€”viz., Easier Monday, our annual race day. Bowna race*, which are always so successfully carried out, are a great attraction for visitors. Crowds from all parts of the district flock here on that day, and I hope this year will not be an exception to the general rule. Cricket matches have been rather scarce about here lately, but I hope soon to hear of our club again ehiniug forth.
