It is ' TOWN.' And like this things went on till one day, when the. gum. leaves hung lifelessly down In the haze . of a ring of bush-fires, that by night made each hill seem a town. They had yarded some steers to be branded — a wild-looking, dangerous lot — And young Freddie had lighted his fire, and the iron wad just getting hot. When Joe Smith, the new boundary rider, whtiso conduct was painfully flash, Passed along down the side of the fence, hitch iu{{ in his red silk-woven sash. All at ouoo came a rush as of water, and Joe made ono spring past the gate, Which withstood for a moment, then crashed with the strain of the multiplied weight.
