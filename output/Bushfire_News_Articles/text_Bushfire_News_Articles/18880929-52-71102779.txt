. BUMBERRY. September 22. OUR NEIGHBORS.-Laßt week tro wore over at Moora. The' road lies through Glendaruel, whore the hillsides are just now covered with nodding feathery shrubs in a bazo of golden blossom. Then tho country opens out in a fino expanse of levol and slightly undulating land. On< the left and front aro woll-oultivatod farms ; while to tho risrhi lie uioo sized paddocks of open ringbarked timbor country, whioh oontain many an aoro of splendid agricultural land. The neat wiro folioing, good gatos, and numerous tanks and darna show the attention giron to the comfort of tho ehoop and tho improvement of the country. Tho ßtation ia about eleven miles from horo, and just an ogrooablo canter. Ono special feature at tho homestead ia tho grand spring well OIOBO to tho houpo, giving a constant and plentiful Bnppiy of delightful water for domeatio purposoa, and for the uso of the homo cattlo ; running through the gardon, where irrigation ia carried on to a small ex tent; and filling a dam in other paddocks. The interesting prouesa of lamb-marking was going on, and the tallies indicated a fair average per centage, notwithstanding tho dry and cold winter. Government regulations for marking Bheep with a station earmark are somewhat as follow: "neaR, oaR, foR, Rama, oR wotheRa-efl* For Females." Tho Moura sheep are also branded cor respondingly. That ia to aay^ the brand on male Bheep iq placed on the near side, while ewes are branded on the right flank. Tais, it seems, assiets in pioking them out more readily when required. We had a good view of a bushfire working up the rugged sides of "the House of Lords," a mountain at some little distance from the home station.
