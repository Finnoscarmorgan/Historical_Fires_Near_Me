LENEVA AND UPPER INDIGO. (FBOM OUB OWN CORRESPONDENT.) SATURDAY, December 30 Since I last wrote we hare experienced rather a peculiar state of weather. The rain, as a late though very welcome visitor to aid us in the fight against ravaging bush-fires which have been devastating our districts lately, favored us with a few downpours shortly before Christmas, and besides doing a great amount of benefit to the various crops which were badly in need of it, gave us every hopes of cool pleasant weather for the general Christmas festivities; but our hopes were raised but to fall again, for Christmas and Boxing Days proved tbe hottest days of the season, and only those who loved the scorching rays of a burning sun resorted to their wonted fields to indulge in their usual Boxing Day sports, such as picnicing, racing, athletic sports, &c.; It is curious to note that each pleasure-seekers were many. To-morrow night (New Fear's Eve) the youth and beauty of Leneva and her adjacent vicinities follow their usual custom by meeting in the Leneva Athenaeum hall for tbe purpose of dancing the old year out and new year in. A very pleasant evening is anticipated, as fair ladies and brave gents from Wodonga, Yackandandah, and Baranduda are cordially invited to participate in our annual " social fly round." Tbe last two days these localities have under gone a thorough soaking. A steady rain set in on Saturday morning early, and has continued to descend almost continuously till this (Sunday) afternoon ; and to-night the heavens look full of rain. The clerk of the weather has evidently returned from his Exhibition trip.
