POSTPONEMENT OF THE ANNUAL | ' REGATTA. SIR,-I am very sorry to see that the Regatta Association are going to make an- other big bungle of the citizens' national holiday by postponing the regatta. It seems to me their only cause is the dangerous state of the cattle jetties. Upon personal inspec- tion, I find that the jetties can be made Bafe in about three days at the most,'and why postpone the regatta ? , The Regatta Com- mittee were aware of the dilapidated state of the jetties at least three mouths ago, and the dilatory way they have acted does not ensure a very successful regatta for the public who give their subscriptions->enr after year very willingly. By the committee put- ting off the regatta, great dissatisfaction has been caused amongst all aquatic mon, who condemn their deoision has been very frivol- ous. Bargcmeu, for instance, como to town, lay up their vessols on the slips to get them io firat-olass trim for a certain date, and that date is altered. I ask how can these men afford to lose their time, trouble and expense they are put to by the notion of the association. The Regatta Association ought to have learned a good lesson from their past experience in postponing regattas. Thank ino you for your valuable space. Yours.eto. I BUSHFIRE.
