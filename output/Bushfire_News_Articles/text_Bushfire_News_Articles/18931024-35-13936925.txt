As this is not a class question, so also is it not a party question, and we cannot supposo that any politician would desiro to employ it for any merely party purpose. But while sympathising with and sharing tho fooling which has animated Mr. Itero in taking stops towards bringing this matter under the attention of the Government, wo find our- selves unable to conour in his view that it is not for those who moro in the subject to propound a definito plan of action. Wo must confess to the bolief that the whole utility of the movement depends upon a practical and legitimate plan of action being put forward. It certainly cannot be Baid with justice that this is a responsibility which spocially attaches to tho Government. "What, in- deed, does tho movement amount to if no definite proposals are embodied in it ? It simply amounts to snying that " somu thing ought to be done " for the unem- ployed-ii this can proporly and possibly bo done. But, as wo havo said before, this is not a novel proposition, or one the property of which inheres in any person or party. Ministers would recognise this just as cordially as Mr. REID. Tho practical question remains what this " somothing " is to bo. If any man has an answer to tliis question which satisfies his own mind it ia his duty to put that answer boforo the public. Tho re- sponsibility of answering it is not a mordy political or official one. It is not restricted | to Ministors of the Crown. It attaches to ovoryono in proportion to his ability to supply the answer. And wo cannot seo that any end can bo served by any deputa- tion ot mombers of Parliament waiting on the Government to demand that " something " be done unless they givo intelligible shape to this affirmation by stating first what thoy wish to bo dono, and secondly showing tho reasons for bolioviug that a romoiy to the ovil would bo tho outcome. It helps us to seo this gravo question in its proper perspective if wo roaliso that, awful in its naturo and in its effects as is this condition of a largo contingont of unemployed and hungry labour by which our civilisation is shamod and defaced, it is one from which no country and no period is free. It differs in its extont and intensity according to tho fluctuations of pros- perity and tho riso and fall of tho demand for labour, but in good or bad times it is always thoro. So far ns this colony is ooncorned wo had this con- dition of thousands of unemployed in times of lavish expondituro on public works, which are now looked back upon as timos of prosperity. And at the present time we seo evidence of its oxistenco in all of the colonios, in the United States, in Eng- land, and in the chief countrios on the Continent of Europe. It would be wrong to put forward this condition of univer- sality of tho problom as reason for, refusing to attempt its solution, or at least ita mitigation. It would bo equally wrong for those who call upon tho Govornmont to suddenly deviso a roniedy, which they uro themsolves unable to suggest, were they to overlook tho chronic and per sistont chnractor and univorsal range of tho malady for which they demand a cure. Sotting aside, then, tho few casual suggestions, whichreflootioncanhardly con- firm, put forward by Mr. HELD in his speoch in tho Assembly on this subject, we havo tho fact that, though all aro agreed as to tho scriou8nossand,womayadd,tho danger aud discredit to general society of this terrible evil, no practical plan for coping with it has yet beon broachod. It is to bo hopod that, in tho interest of avoid- ing a moroly storilo rosult and of precluding that character of election- eering wliich has boon attributed to the movement, the time which remains before the Bonding of a deputation will bo diligently and conscientiously utilised in framing a practical and serious plan. If wo are not prepared with distinct sugges- tions in this direction, wo can at least help in preventing futility and failure by point- ing out tho negative conditions wliich must bo kept in mind. It is not too much to say, and Mr. REID and other spoakers on his sido of the question admitted tho fact, that it would bo usoloss to propose that tho Govornmont should levy taxation on tho working soction of tho com- munity to próvido relief works for tho rost. It is noodloss to point out the objections to that courso. They oro supported by roason and by general experience and aro deeply engraved in the political history of Now South Wales. Tho Promior has positively ro fused to liston to any such suggestion, and it cannot bo questioned that tho country would sup]iorfc him in tho refusal. Next theio is the suggestion of resuming publio works. Apart from the consideration that it is impossible for us to do this on more than a very restricted scale, wo have tho further consideration that such works undortakou morely to provide employment dangerously roBomblo relief works. Woro wo to con- duct thom on tho principio of employing workers according to tho longthof timothoy had beon in the colony, or to tho question whether thoy were mnrriod or unmarried, as suggested by Mr. EEID, all vestige of difference from relief works puro and simplo would disappear. Whatever might bo tho precautions takon, tho offoct would bo to bring tho unomployod of all the colonies to our torritory, and having conceded tho principio of tho duty of the State to provide employment, wo could not deny it to thom. Finally, it is utterly Usoloss to talk vaguoly about gotting rid of tho difficulty by " settling the unem- ployed on tho lands of the colony." That might go for something last yoar, but it is worthless now. Wo aro ongaged in trying tho experiment, and so far the indications are not encouraging. As Mr. LYNE said in Parliament tho othor evening, plenty of pooplo will go on the land as long ns they are " paid £25 to go thoro." What we have to soo is whether thoy will remain thero when the money _ is gone. These considerations which we havo adduced .serve only, we freely concede, as warning beacons. They show whore it is useless to attempt to go. They do not indicate the path loading to a practical and encouraging plan of action. But if this movemont is to como to anything moro than vague and futilo talk, that plan is what the movers in the matter must be 1 roporod to put before the judgment of the community. The trustees of the National Park con- tinue to show good work done in the conservancy of that public domain, marked with an increasing measure of public appreciation. The report just laid before Parliament makes those results plain. It is now little more than thirteen years since by the doubling of its area Sir JOHN ROBERTSON dedicated to the people of New South Wales the National Park. But that was not the park which we now know. It was then a tract of harsh and rugged country, difficult of access, and hardly tempting oven when reached. Naturally, the demand being all but non-existent, there was an absence of accommodation, the beautiful gorges and hillsides were overgrown with brush and scrub, and through such a wilderness the wayfarer had to make his road to those points he might desire to reach. Year by year the work of making this great pleasure-ground fully available to the people has gone on, supported by the moderate votes of Parliament, and directed on the whole with judgment and good taste. Mistakes haeo been made, but they are insignificant when account is taken of the nature of the task and of the case with which the judicious improve- ment of a virgin territory might have been suffered to degenerate into a process of vandalism worse, because more thorough, than the mischief wrought by careless and idle hands. What the trustees have done is in the nature of a conservancy. Fences have been erected to preserve the land from trespass, roads and paths made so that visitors could reach the beauty spots, such buildings have been constructed as were required for employees or tourists, water has been conserved, and the destruction of the flora and the indigenous or imported fauna has been rigorously prohibited. In this way a great deal of useful work has been done, while so unobtrusive is it that the character of the landscape is not impaired but rather displayed in its hap- piest aspects. By those persistent efforts, seconded by the cheap regular service of trains, the National Park has not only been evolved from a scrubby and hilly waste into the resort so much admired by those who know it, but also the number of such admirers is increased every year. The many make an occasional holiday trip admirers the few spend days or weeks in a charming retirement. It does not call for much prescience to realise what so great an area of the char- acteristic coast country within so short a distance of the capital as well as of several important centres of population must become in the future. Our coast scenery may be wanting in some of those features which are fondly remembered by natives of other maritime lands. We have no lochs or fiords to break the line of land ; the rich vegetation of the South of Europe gives place to a low bush, monotonous iu colour and size ; and the historic associations which bestow dignity and intorost on the coasts of Europe are lacking to these shores. Yet it has a beauty of its own, this littoral of ours. The winds of the sea and the barrenness of the immediate shore compel the vegetation of the seaside to be limited in variety and beauty. But not far inland, where the soil is kindlier and the climate also favourable, a different appearance meets the eye. So it is at the National Park. At this time of the year the hillsides and the flats by the creeks are bright with wild flowers growing amid a profusion of handsome shrubs and creepers, which in turn are lowly when compared to the semi- tropical palms, the characteristic eucalypts, and other noble trees. It was a wise and patriotic sentiment which in- duced the Government of 1880 to set apart for all time as the resort of all the com- munity an area so accessible to the great bulk of the people, and one large enough in point of size to preserve the effectual features of the metropolitan coastlands. Year by year the national character of that domain must increase. Outside its precincts the hand of man is changing the face of the land. Settlement increases, the forest primeval falls, and the indi- genous growth yields place to other forms of life. With their shelter and their food preserves disappearing, with the competi- tion of introduced birds, and with the destruction wrought among them by the Cockney sportsmen to whom everything that is wild is fair game, the birds of the coast scatter and thin. The flora under- goes a similar change. But inside the bounds of the National Park it is not so, it should not ever be so. There the beautiful flowers of this part of the country bloom as freely as if the wild flower show had never been. There the graceful silver flourishes, spared from bushfires or woodcutters or the cleavers. There the native birds resort, and even the most shy repay the hospitality that saves them from disturbance or destruction by their confidence and their uncaged beauty. Though we have no Yellowstone Park or Niagara Reservation, it is probable that the total of our public lands dedicated to popular enjoyment would be found to bear comparison with that of any country. It is true that some of the land has been parted with which should have been re- tained, such for instance as the fore- shores of the harbour, respecting which a want of foresight has deprived this capital of an adornment such as would have been almost unique—a public drive and parade by the seaside all along the indentations of Port Jackson. But we have not done amiss at other points of our territory. In the Mountains a number of the places commanding the noblest prospects or the fairest haunts are public property. Scarcely a town of any importance in the colony but has its park for the recreation of all, even where wood- land or plain begins from the ends of the main streets. The National Park is a different possession from these. Though it is so near to Sydney it is a heritage of the whole people. It will preserve, far out- lasting the generation that dedicated it, a portion of the metropolitan coast in which the primitive features of that landscape will remain only so far touched by the changes all about it as may have been found necessary for public access and convenience. And more and more, as the lands of the metropolitan and adjacent counties pass into private occupation and use, the reservation of the National Park will serve useful purposes for public enjoyment, for holiday-makings, and for that tranquil and sanative retreat to nature of which in one of his latest books Mr. STEVENSON gave such a charming picture from Barbizon. There is much cause for congratulation in the settlement of differences between the Steamship Owners of Australasia and the Marine Engineers, and the signing of an agreement for a term of years. Not, indeed, because the engineers have con- sented to a considerable reduction of wages and to the introduction of a method of calculating the nominal horse-power of the vessels they work on which will have the effect of making the all-round reduction press more heavily still. There is no satisfaction in a reduc- tion of wages or profits per se, but the reverse. The point is that the reduc- tions have been accepted after the taking of a ballot amongst the men, and a conference between their re- presentatives and those of the owners, at which the whole question was fairly discussed. All that took place has not been reported ; but enough has been reported to indicate that there has been an honest endeavour to look the situation in the face. The owners on their side pointed out how the changed conditions of the trade had affected the interests of the capital invested in it ; and on the side of the men the opinion was candidly expressed that in some degree the difficulty was the result of over-competition. The pro- bability is that at last the con- ditions were thoroughly understood, and the inevitable was accopted under the feel- ing that it was inevitable. How much mischief has been caused in other trade difficulties through failure to arrive at this conclusion, by reason of want of candour or want of confidence. Where free men are concerned—and in communities like those freedom should never be surrendered there will always be a line beyond which neither employer nor employed can rightly be expected to go in making concessions. Men are at liberty to refuse to work for what they consider an inefficient wage, and employers are at liberty to bring their works to a stop when they cease to yield a profit. How many a disastrous strike has taken place for want of a clear understanding of the un- controllable conditions of trade, The engineers are to be credited with an in- telligent recognition of the requirements of the times, and also of the principle that it is better under trying circumstances that a trade should be nursed even at some sacrifice than be driven away or destroyed by blind efforts to resist the irresistible. It is to have the midsummer menace of Australia brought very close to us when we may see the clouds of smoke from forest fires wafted to north and south of the capital, and read of conflagrations along the Parra- matta and of shipmasters navigating their vessels into port through seas lighted by the flaming headlands. During last week the succession of hot winds prepared the country over which they passed for an outbreak of bush fires, and in the metro- politan counties the fires came, luckily without the widespread damage which in settled regions they are capable of doing. For that we may be grateful, but it would not be amiss to look rather beyond the immediate occasion for gratitude and con- sider the possibilities of the near future. It already seems likely that the season before the country will be found exacting. Though early, the summer begins to be hot and dry. What this means is that in a short time we may have every condition conducive to damage through bush fires. Water will be scarce, grass will be ready to catch ablaze at the least provocation, and the bush will be full of inflam- mable material. If the summer is thus unfavourable, what has so often happened will happen again. One of the many accidents that lead to bush fires will occur ; then crops and growing food will be destroyed, fencing burned to the ground, domestic and de- pastured animals will lose their lives, and perhaps here and there a farmer's homestead will suffer. Added to these losses must be reckoned the prodigies of human toil which these disastrous occa- sions call for in repressing or diverting the course of conflagration. Such is the nature of the country that even where some protective measures have been taken, such as strips of green cultivation, ploughed ground, hedges, and so forth, complete protection is as yet out of the power of of even the farmer who culti- vates a comparatively small area. In those circumstances it becomes in the highest degree incumbent on all who pay a due regard to the rights of others to guard against risking property by carelessness in the use of fire. Work- people, travellers, picknickers, and others owe it to the community not to increase the inevitable danger of our severe summers by preventable dangers. It is nearly im- possible to ascertain the origin of a great bush fire, because it destroys the evidences, but it is suspected that carelessness is re- sponsible for not a few. It is not too much to ask of all persons traversing the country at this time of year to see that they do not leave along their course the material to start a destructive fire.
