NEWS OF THE WEEK. The Rev. D. P. M. Hulberfc has been making a pastoral tour round portion of this district. He started on the evening of Tues day, the 15th inst., visited several farms, held service at Mrs. Booking's homestead next day, and a morning service at Mr. Whitticker's farm on the Thursday. The rev. gentleman then proceeded to Mr. Horsley's station, at Yabtree, to hold evening service. We have not of latd visited this locality, but we learn that such have been the judicious im provements the present occupant has effected that if any of the Hillas family were now to revisit Yabtree they would hardly know the .place again. Mr. Hulbert christened some infant3, and was gratified to hear that the elder children of several families in that locality went regularly to receive religious instruction at Mrs. Windeyer's Sunday-school. Twenty seven persona assembled at Mr. Wbit ticker's for divine service, and we understand that upwards of sixty people have been bene fited by this pastoral' visitation of Mr. Humbert;. The rev. gentleman has since vasited , Adelong and' on Thursday left Gun dagajforjGoulbum.^ ^_ ? _ j 'On Monday last an examination of the children attending the. Church of England school, 'South Gundagai, took place, prior to the breaking up for the Christinas holidays. ,G.,,Stuckey. Esq., one of the LuchI Board, was present. The scholars answered the questions put by Mr. McCutcheon with great readiness, and the discipline,. intelligence, and marked improvement in the various branches they displayed, as contrasted with their perfor mances at their last examination, before Mr. Coburn, inspector, proved that their preceptor had labored diligently and skilfully in his vocation. The attendance has greatly in creased since Mr. McCutcheon has assumed the mastership of the school, and we trust that it will continue to be well supported. In time perhaps a better school building may be obtained ; meanwhile it is satisfactory to learn that the children are carefully taught in the present place. According to their annual custom the Liver pool and London and Globe Insurance Com pany have issued an almanac for the ensuing year to their constituents. It is remarkably tastefully and elegantly got up. This artistic .'production is from the office of Mr. Lee: lithographer; Sydney, and is orna mental [in addition tajujng useful in- any counting house or othjSfpla^eVf business.' ' Dr. R. N. .CobbeuT has, \hÂ« official organ intimates, been appointed Government vaccina tor for the Gundaa&i; district, j ? __ ? ' We have been requested to givo the follow ing abstract of the memoranda forwarded by Mr. Ficzhardinge to the Attorney-General, relative to the charge of attempted suicide brought against Mr. Russell, at Wagga Wagga, a report of which appeared in our lost issue. The Attorney-General, as we stated, at once directed that Mr. Russell should be admitted to bail, and it is very doubtful whether any further proceedings will be taken in the matter. The statement we refer to asserts that Mr. Russell, at the hearing of the charge, before the Wagga Wagga Bench, had no opportunity of vindicating himself, because when Mr Russell's solicitor rose to address the 'bench on his behalf, and to propose to call witnesses as to his previous habits and mental condition, or the state of mind he was in at the time he made the assertions on the strength of which ho was given into custody, and also to state the reasons that caused Mr Russell to assert that he had intended to shoot himself. the Police Magistrate stated that the Bench had already decided to commit the case for trial, thu3 virtually closing the case on an ex parte statement. The facts that would have been stated are (the memoranda show) as fol lows: He (Mr Russell) had been harrassed by privato affairs, had been for three nights previous without sleep, and had driven sixty miles when he reached Kyamba on the 10th inst., eating nothing by the way, but drinking brandy to sustain him. :After attempting vain-' lytii pTocoeTtto'Albury'heVent toTaed'and fell asleep, but awoke up shortly after, and felt his head so bad that he called up the landlord and, as was stated, was seized with a sort of fit, during which he (Mr. Russell) suddenly rose and shut and locked the door of his room. Mr. Smith and the others then entered the room through the window, doubtless adding to Mr. Russell's state of alarm and nervousness thereby. When he had a little recovered he sat up with Messrs. Rouse, Lavender and Smith, and was allowed to drink several glasses of brandy. After arranging to go to Albury next morning Mr. Russell retired to bed, and now recollects distinctly fearing some one would jump in at his window and do him some injury. He, therefore, sought for his revolver, (which ho always placed when travelling underneath his niattross) and having found it sat up in the bed watching, to warn anyone from annoying him further. Hence, as stated in the evident. 'MV. Russell called out ' stand clear ' when Mr. Smith came into the room and laid hold of him, and in the struggle the pistol went off accidentally. On being'told by Mr. Rouse that he had wounded and nearly snot Mr. Smith, Mr. Russell, being, half delirious and not responsible for his statements at the time, and fearing such an accusation might be brought against him, burst into hysterical tears, and said he meant to kill himself, not being collected enough to reflect upon the serious nature of the offence he was thus charging himself with. The document we quote from asserts that Mr. Russell never in his life contemplated suicide. After he had slept he awoke in perfect .con sciousness, as if from some horrid dream, and was so self possessed that he was allowed to drive in his own buggy to Wagga Wagga. His position, charged as he then was with such, a grave offence, was worse than before, and had he been inclined to attempt suicide he had both a razor and a knife in his possession. Mr. Smith admitted that Mr. Russell was in 'r^eifee^pessesaionHjfjJuB^paases. .but^BsitWhia, Was unable to withdraw the' charge against him. It was also urged that Mr. Russell had suffered deeply from the imprisonment of four days and nights he had already undergone, on a charge based entirely on words he made use of when laboring under excitement which produced a state of mind akin to temporary, insanity; that he could produce ample medical testimony to his previous and' present sanity ; and satisfactory evidence . as to his general habits and', character. This statement we trust will have the effect of clearing Mr. Russell from any further annoyance relative to this unfortunate affair. A rather unpleasant snake adventure hap pened to the wife and children of Mr. Antonio Melzer, of Gundagai, the other day. They had descended into the wine cellar at the back of their residence, at Spring flat, when they were alarmed by a hissing noise, and on looking round saw a large snake sitting erect under the steps, like an animated corkscrew, and darting out its forked tongue in a menacing manner. Not being able to get away they called out, and their cries brought Mr. Melzer to their assistance, but as he also came into the cellar before he was aware of the cause of their alarm, and was unable to get out to procure a weapon, his aid was of little avail. At length Mr. Melzer made a hole in the roof by which he escaped, and having procured the assistance of a neighbour named Paslow they made a hole in the wall opposite to the steps, introduced the muzzle of a gun, and shot the reptile. The snake was of a leaden colour, very thick in the middle, and six feet six inches long. A flock of 7,500 travelling sheep belonging to Messrs. Stinson, passed through Gundagai on Thursday last in charge of Mr. John Large. '? ' A Gundagai pig startled a horse that was being watered on Tuesday, and the rider mounted thereon came]to/grief, Being.pledg ed;to secrecy we can give no'furtherpartioulars than to say tho accident is not likely to cause nny serious consequences. . ... . :, . Evans' grand moving panorama, depicting incidents in the life and adventures of James Morrill, will be exhibited this evening at Webb's Assembly rooms. As it is quite a new exhibition - we are not in a position personally to speak of its merits, but judging from .the eulogies passed . upon, it by the press of the towns where it has.- already been shewn we should imagine it to be as .interesting as that of the Amorican War. The proprietor -is known to ub, and if enterprise will et all times command success, he must now be in very affluent circumstances. _ ? We are glad to learn that the rumour. that the f Oidium Tuckerii 'had appeared at- the Lake Albert vineyards, near Wagga Wagga, is incorrect.- Our ' vignerons,' should, however, still carefully inspect their vines at once. With regard to remedies used, Mr. Fowler, of Camp belltown, has applied successfully a solution of Bitlphur and lime. The lime and sulphur, in equal parts of 4J lbs., were well mixed in a dry state, and put into two gallons of water and boiled for fifteen minutes. -This solution can, of course, be used in any weather; but tho dry sulphur should he applied on a calm, hot, dry day, and in the morning so that the sun may quickly come on it. .In: moat cbbos two applications will be sufficient, if care is taken to sulphur tho whole plant. .This week the weather has been intensely hot, ranging from 102 to 108 degrees in the shade, the air has been dim with smoke and haze, and bush fires have been burning ia many of the ranges round Gundagai. All tha bush, indeed, from Nangus in a north eastern direction, as far as Cuotntnundra, has been ia flames, and station holders have been up watching for some nights. At Nangus a strong able-bodied man while assisting to beat out the flames' was so overcome by the heat that he fell senseless on the burning grass, and but for tho ttid of his mates might have heen seriously if not fatally injured. Hot winds, blazing sunshine, tepid water, heat, glare, dust, bush-fires, dried herbage, . ; and a plague of flies, are sorry Christmas boxes ; but they aro what .the season presents ? ... ;. to residents within our locality. Perhaps, in .',..? a minor way, none suffer more inconvenience ? ? from such weather than newspaper proprie tors. It is almost impossible for pressmen to keep the rollers used for laying on the ink, . which are chiefly compounded of glue and : treacle, from melting. Our .readers who have complained of smudginess in our last issue little know the difficulties with which we have had to contend. We have already had .to make three new rollers this week, and it is. quite possible that before the inside of the present hsue is printsd off we may, have to get a fourth manufactured. if (j-n Christmas diiy there was a pleftsantfH^Tf -Htf! breeze and the air was a trifle- cooler than -in. the previous part of the week, which would doubtless enable all people to do ample justice to their Christmas dinners. Gundagai put on a holiday aspect, the various houses of enter tainment and stores being decked with ' green boughs in honor of the day. Even the temporary aspect of verdure and csolness thus imparted to our streets was so refreshing that we could not but again reflect how great an. \ ? ' ' improvement to the general appearance of our township and to the comfort of our residents might be effected by planting a row of trees on each side of the main street, as we formerly ? .'.'. suggested. The religious services appropriate for tho day were conducted in St. John's ' ' ? Anglican church by the Rev. H. S. Seaborn. A telegraph line inspector has sometimes hard duties to uerfom. The late bush fires having burned down many of the posts be tween the Adelong Crossing place and Mun darlo, Mr. Smithers started on Thursday morn ing to repair the damage done. The day was ' intensely hot, and while effecting his mission, ' Mr. Smithers was so overcome by the sun'a rays and the heat from the smouldering fires around that he was only able to crawl to thjjj||^ .' shade of a tree when he fainted. On rccovePBHfc ing he found his clothes burned, his hands ';^P? blistered, and his pocket handkerchief smoul dering away in his pocket. Mr. Smithers, with great exertion, effected the temporary renair3 necessarv. and started this morninir to complete his task. It is an undeniable fact that the reverend Mr. Hulbert's pastoral visit to Gundagai has had the effect' of causing the church wardens and other office-bearers to send their unconditional resignation to the Bishop of the Diocese. The contract of P. J. McAlister and W. J.. Bowen has been accepted for a mail by coach between Murrumburrah, Cootamundra, Junee, and Wagga Wagga via Bethungra and Conju- gong, once a week for one year, at Â£125. The next homeward mail will be despatched from Sydney on the 2nd January. Letters - and papers intended to go by it should be posted in Gundagai' not later than Thursday next. ? ..:.' -.- Among a list'of' approved claims for pre emptive leases in' ihe' ' Government Gazette * we find tho following :â Leah Howe, Jugiong, 960 acres, County Buccleugh; R.

We have seen in one or two papers a paragraph, originally derived from the ' Wagga -Wigga Advertiser,' stating, relative to some remarks that appeared in this journal as to 'the snagging operations on the Murnimbidgee, ' Our contemporary (the ' Gundagai Times '): - - predicts a - brilliant future for the- .farmers ?? ? ?

'commenced- it was supposed '* ';,. . an outlet -for the surplus produce oÂ£.these ' . districts existed in lower RiTcrina, and we urged that if our residents, did', not provide themselves with a river steamer and barges ' '. to test the merits of the water communication now, -at great expense, placed within 'their Tencb. no one would be likely to find these- ' '- -essentials for them. We wish wt-'eonld ?' predict ??'?'? a brilliant future for the formers of oiir district,' from river transit or from any othor source; but at present 'we do not see it. : No doubt it will eventually arrive, but, aa in the case of the ' good time coming ' foretold in song, they will have to 'wait a littls longer ' for it. We have never, in truth, been ;.. . sanguine as to the benefits tho clearing of the ;?-, river would confer on our district, _ but we . should like,' nevertheless, to see an attempt mode to test its merits. The river is now, we understand, fairly cleared between Gundagai . and Wagga Wagga,- with, the exception. of i; Borne few large snags, which the steam winch constructed in this locality will remove on it* downward progress ; and the staff of men, . punts, -kc., have left for Narandora, to procooA with tho downward clearing of tho river.

He regretted to be thus personal, that he should be dragged from a bed of sick ness to vindicate his honour from the gross as perdonajof this pettyfogging politician, this paltry logician, this confused metaphysician.
