I TO THE EDITOR OP THE HERALD. | Sir -It is with regret that m my cattleowuers in tho Northorn districts note the fact that the Minis- ter« of Agriculture of tho different colonies aro apparently unable to agree on tim mattoi of quaran- tine lines, as v. o feel that gre itcr secunty would result it New South Wales wero co operating with QuecDsl ind in trying to stay the spread of the ticks It seems to us that one colony should assist the other m just tho samo manner as settlers would do in tho case of a bushfire Each settler would uot wait for tho tiro at Ins ov, a boundary, but would co out to assist his neighbour to keep tho fire from spreading A fence mil not stop ticks, neither mil a parallel line nor a meridian, hut as cattle appear to bo their principal carrying agents thcro might be somo chance of staying then progress bv drawing a cimiaiitmn hue along the high v. aterflhed Anyouo who knows anything about tho workiug of cattle knows that it is much ussier to keep them aivaj from a boundary which follows the top of a high nug« than from oue which follows a watercourse whoro they go every da) for water, or u parallel line v, hich probably crosses every watercourse m the district Could not the Ne« South Wales authorities make a compromise with Queensland m this war-Instead of running tho quaiantmo lino roughly along the 118th meridian, could they not rnnit from a point on tho border near Killarney along the main dividing rango towards loon oomba, and thcuce either north or noith- west by ono of tho ranges, or nest by the railway line, on condition that Queensland keeps it a strict quarantine hue, and also that she allows no cattle from the present infected country to bo into Unsbane, and m addition keeps the Logan country as a buffer area ? lins would leave tho Darling Downs, Moonie, and Roma diBtnct3 free to send their stoek into New South Wales lliose districts aro and alwavs have beou perfect!} free from infection, aud by releasing thcin from quarantino New South Wales would also havo their support on her side in the matter of keep- ing infected or suspected cattle from coming into Ilrisbane, viboreas at present the feeling in Southern Queensland scorns to bo that Now South Wales has clo"od so much of tho border that she might just as well closo the lot By running the quarantine uno along tho main rango tho ticks might bo kept confined to tho coast country but ii Queensland does not make thnt a quuruütiuo line-and sho is hardlv likely to do so without pressure from Now South Wales-tho ticks might ev ontually como across the main range on lo tho Condamme, and the proposed two-rail fence from Killarney to Wallangarra won't stop thom w hen Queensland cattle carry thom up to tho border 1 lluro is not much danger of thom crossing into New South Wales near tho Tweed and Richmond, as the border there is uearlj all covered with Bcrub, through winch cattlo will not pass , but anyono who knows tho country whero the border divides the Condamino and M'Intjro country from New South Wales will realise that no power on earth eau stop tho tickB crossing if once brought cljso te the border by Queensland cattle It is true that the border of tho colony follows the watershed the greater part of tho way from Wallangarra to Killarney , but tho rango in that part is very low, and the country is closely Bcttlod on both sidoB along tho border lino The present arrangements witn regard to saddle horses and vehicles croBsing the border are very m couvoment to travellers For instance, if a messenger is sent to carry this letter und others to Killarney, which, though two miles inside Queensland, is our nearest telegraph and railway station, he canuot ndo back into New South Wales without either going first to Warw lok (a further distance of 2,1 milos) to procuro a certificate from a Queensland inspector or el»o waiting in Killarney till the following Thurs- day winch is tho Queensland inspector's day for visiting that place 1 his in a district perfectly freo from infection seems to bo an unnecessary inconvcni ouco to tho travelling public I mi, &c;, BOVINE FEDERATIONISr. Upper Clarenco, Juno 1}.
