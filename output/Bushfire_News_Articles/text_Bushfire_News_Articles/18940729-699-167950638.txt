BLACK MONDAY. Victoria has had its ' Black Thursday ' ? when bush-fires devastated vast areas, and the smoke of ravage darkened the heavens. It has had its ' Black Wednesday '—when Graham Berry (with Prognathous Patterson as s very willing lieutenant) gleefully sacked hundreds of Civil servants. It is now to have its ' Black Monday.' PrognathouB Patterson, the quondam man of bones and blood and shambles, held a Cabinet meeting last Monday, and decided to dismiss about 500 men in the Victorian Railway Depart ment, and about 100 men in other branches of the service — principally the Post-Ofllce. Up till now, most people thought that tho Bailway Commissioners were the arbiters of the fates of the railway servants, but Prog nathouB Patterson wants to affirm the prin ciple that political power inles the fates of those unfortunates. Those dismissed will chiefly be railway porters, engine-cleaners, i ettlers, carriage-cleaners, and 'some clerks.' The small fry, it will be perceived, and not the fattcd-calvcB and the curled darlings. As a sort of let-'em-down-easy pretence, there ib s showy programme spoken of to grant these retired officials ' special facilities for settling on the Crown lands of the colony :' areas on the Murray and in Eastern Gippsland bein? specially indicated. Will the Democratic lynxes in Victoria please keep their optics open for mallee lands job bery, for which there is plenty of scope ? This suddenly affectionate talk of throwing open cleared mallee lands to pretendedly pitied dischargees, smells 'ancient and fish like.' Let the local lynxes report fully to the world whatever they observe. The croco dile tears of Prognathous Patterson are hum bug. If the officials are not wanted let him say so at once, and discharge them without waste of bogus emotion. If they are wanted, then Patterson's conduct is tyrannical and unwarrantable. Lynxes, watch I — and see whether the vacancies are speedily filled up with protegees.
