TRUNDLE. (FROM OUB OWN CORRESPONDENT.) We had about 80 points of rain on Monday, 29th ultâ€ž which was very welcome, especially to sheepowners, as it has knocked nearly all the grass-seeds out which have been destructive to sheep and wool in this locality this season. Since then the weather has been warm and windy, and smoke from bush-fires is to be seen almost daily. I am told that a brick-kiln is to be started here at a not far distant date. This will be a boon to settlers. They will have them close at hand then instead of having to cart them long distances as now. Iu response to an invitation from Mr. and Mrs. John M'Keowen, of Wilga-park, I journeyed thither on New Year s Day, and towards dusk buggies and horsemen were to be seen rolling up from all quarters. After an hour had been spent in preparing his or her toilet dancing was commenced and kept up continuously until about 12 o'clock, when supper was announced, wbich was served in tbe spacious verandah of the dwellinghouse. The table was found to contain viands of every description, a credit to tbe caterers. Upwards of 80 ladies and gentlemen sat down, and all seemed to enjoy what was before them. After ample justice had been done to the edibles a re turn was made to the ballroom, where, with the exception of a few very appropriate songs being given, dancing was resumed and kept going hard and fast until broad daylight, when after partaking of breakfast and a hearty shakehands with our always generous host and hostess all started for their respective homes, thoroughly satisfied that the last had been one of the most enjoyable nights ever spent in Trundle.
