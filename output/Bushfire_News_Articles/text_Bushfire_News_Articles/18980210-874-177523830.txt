A BUSH-FIRE TRAGEDY. For Dudeleigh on a holiday The woods with joy abound, And wending there hie lonely way / A sylvan pool he found. And through the long dry grass it ran, And o'er the fallen logs To Tvhere Augustas bathed—poor man! And burned up all hie togs 1 "A Bwim is just the thing to please ; There's no one near the place." He bathed, and on the northern breez® The bush-fire came apace. Toung Dudeleigh roamed the bushland dressed In twigs and such green goods, ^IJntil the peelers did arrest \- This wild man of the woods.
