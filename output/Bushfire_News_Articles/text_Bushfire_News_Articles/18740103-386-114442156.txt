Telegraphic Intelligence. BUNBURY, 2nd. Jan. The telegram in Wednesday's Inquirer is an untruthful misrepresentation. Mr. Carey was pulled off hishorse and his whip wrenched away from him; that used by Dr. Love grove was a 'comnmon jockey whip'; wounds on the liead look as if it had a very heavy butt end, and life was for days endangered. 'Itre was no crowd whatever, it occurred early in the morning, at least four hours he fore the election, and in an out of the way place. So far from Banyan being a well known paralytic, he is a nell-known stock rider, and as such has been employed by Dr. Lovegrove for yea s in charge of the town hern, while sometimes rationed and clothed by the Governm nt. M. Carer as a public duty asked for no more than an investiga. tion it must now take place. . ( )RTI-HAM. 2nd Jan. Bush fires raging. Mr. Smith, and M. Oliver lost most of their wheat by it ; Chas. IHicks lost wheat, hay, barley and sandal wood. Reported that Mr. E. Hammersley lost all his outbuildings and machinery, nothing saved except dwelling house; can not vouch for truth but believe it correct. Heat frightful; thermometer 112 in the shade. SATURDAY.
