It is also a story of movement, that begins in one place and moves with the fire to another. Gellibrand to Lake Colac, this is the vicinity of the fire.
This story was actually published in William Howitt’s book “Tallangatta, the Squatters Home A story of Australian Life’ (1857) published in London⁠2 , what are the iterations of the different ways that this story has travelled? And who told this story? “Black Thursday” published in the Illawarra Mercury (Wollongong, NSW) by an unattributed author on the 1st December 1856, was originally published in “Household Worlds,” a weekly English magazine edited by Charles Dickens in the 1850s. There are a number of stories that mention “Black Thursday” in the data-set (how many in total?), with three that take their title directly from the event:","“By this means he had hitherto prevented the fire from reaching his homestead ; and he had strongly recommended the same plan to his neighbors, though generally with little effect”
“The circle within his clear boundary was untouched by the fire”.
“He had felled the forest-trees, leaving only one here and there, at such distances that there was little fear of ignition. As the summer dried the grass, he had set fire to it on days when the wind was gentle enough to leave the flame at command ; watching, branch in hand, to beat out any blaze that might have travelled into the forest. By this means he had hitherto prevented the fire from reaching his homestead ; and he had strongly recommended the same plan to his neighbors, though generally with little effect, Now the fire was so terrible, and sparks flew so wide on the wind, thatlie feared they might kindle the grass round his homestead, and that he might find everything and every person the e consumed. But, behold ! the gleaming, welcome water of Lake Colac”.",Precise,Point,"Lake Colac, VIC","He suddenly checked his horse, and listening, grew pale at the sound which reached him. It was a low deep roar, as of a wind in the tree-trops, or of a waterfall, distant, and smothered in a deep ravine. ' God have mercy ! ' he exclaimed : ' a bush fire I and in this thick forest ! ' Once more he sprang forward, shouting, thundering with his whip. He and the herd were galloping along the narrow wood track. But, as he had turned west ward in tho direction of his home, the woods — of which he had before seen the boundary — now closed for some miles upon him ; and, as he could not turn right or left for the chaos of vines and scrub that obstructed the forest, the idea of being overtaken there by tho bnsh-fire was horrible.",17685,Black Thursday,Black Thursday,1856-12-01,1856-12-01,,1,,N,,Household Words,669,"Illawarra Mercury (Wollongong, NSW : 1856 - 1950)",Illawarra Mercury,"-34.4248336, 150.8931132","Wollongong, NSW",Provincial,New South Wales,2629,William Howitt,,Unattributed,Male,British,,,Unknown,British,,Unattributed,"the squatter, and dashed his horse over fallen trees ; through crashing thickets, first on one side of the road, and then on the other. Crack, crack went the stinging, slashing whip ; loud was the bark of dogs ; and the mob of cattle ruelied forward at headlong speed. The young man gazed upward ; and, through the only narrow opening of the forest saw strange volumes of smoke rolling southward. Hotter, hotter, strongly and more steadily came the wind. He suddenly checked his horse, and listening, grew pale at the sound which reached him. It was a low deep roar, as of a wind in the tree-trops, or of a waterfall, distant, and smothered in a deep ravine. ' God have mercy ! ' he exclaimed : ' a bush fire I and in this thick forest !

This part of the story is about bushrangers in Tasmania – the threat of bushrangers and not of Aboriginal people – in this case it about collusion with a bush-ranger, but is a sotry about how despite precautions, it is a possum who sets fire to the bush; the difficulties of the bush:","The party indulged in a laugh in which Juniper himself joined, and Maxwell, in order to remove erroneous impressions from the Colonel's mind, related in terms highly complimentary to Juniper his adventure with the bushranger at the time of the fire. Mrs. Maxwell also took that opportunity to acknowledge the services of Mr. Juniper in arresting the progress of the fire, as, were it not for him, their house would in all proba- bility have been burned down. "" I believe, Colonel,"" she continued, "" that the bush-fires in New South Wales are much more terrible than they are here ?"" "" I don't know, ma'am,"" said the officer, "" what they are here, but I think I ought to know something about them there. I wasonce, ma'am, up at my station with my son Frederick, and took it into my head to go on an exploring expedition. We took a tent and some provisions with us, thinking probably to be out a few nights. It was in the middlel of summer, the heat was sufficient to broil a chop on a rock, and the grass was so dry that it would almost have taken fire if you walked upon it with nails in your boots. On the second day we found a dry creek, and rambling along it for some distance found a hole containing some pure-water, at which Fred was so delighted that he nearly tumbled into it. Well, ma'am, I thought we would have tea, and in order to boil the kettle I to pulled out my flint and steel and began to strike a light ' What are you going to do, father ?' said Fred. ' To light a fire,' sir, said I.' ' For God's sake,' said he, ' don't, we can do without tea ; if the bush takes fire, it will leave us as bare as when we were born.' ' Hold your tongue, sir?' said I ; do you to think I havn't lived long enough in the world to know how to take care of a fire—as for being bare I shan't wonder at seeing you go out of the world as naked as you came into it.' "" While I was speaking I struck a light and scraped a few twigs and bark together at the root of a big hollow gum-tree, and soon had a nice little fire that could not possibly do any damage, though that cautious son of mine was not satisfied but began to scrape away all round it to prevent its catching the grass, while I went to the water-hole and filled the kettle.When I came back the scamp was still scraping away, and I roared to him to take himself off, or I would throw the kettle of water all over him—when just at that moment, Sir, a lot of rubbish and dust shot down front the hollow tree, and bump and squash thundered a great hairy badger as big as a mastiff, which jumped right into the fire, then ran between my legs, knocking me down on Fred's back, so that we scrambled thus together for ten minutes before we could get up, and when we did the bush was in a blaze."" "" Dear me,"" said Mrs. Maxwell, "" that was great misfortune; I hope your homesteal did not get burned."" "" No, ma'am, the manager had burnt a train round it before the hot summer came on —the only wise thing I ever knew him to do —but the grass on a hundred thousand acres was burnt as bare as the desert of Idumea."" "" What did the poor sheep do, Sir ?"" asked Juniper. "" The beat thing they could, Sir ; they had to watch the grass growing again and nibble at it the same way as you would in a time of famine at the tail of a rat after his body had been done for."" Mr. Juniper laughed.

Old Colonial Weather, chapter XXXVII is a curious chapter taken from the collection “Recollections of a Septuagenarian” printed into the South Australian Register. In this collection (so and so) reflects on changes in Australian society since earlier ‘colonial days;’ this particular chapter explores changes in climate and weather. He reflects, “these and other processes consequent on our settling here have, as old colonists agree, considerably modified our weather. My present business, however, is with that old and kindred phenomena as we found them on arrival in the colony”",,,Black Thursday,"That day fruits of all kinds then in season were literally roasted on the trees, having the exact flavour of fruit long submitted to the action of fire. Leaves of trees and bushes and the upper portions of vegetables were so thoroughly calcined that a mere touch reduced them to powder. The whole of Australia appears to have been subjected to the inclemency of that unearthly day, and it assumed much greater severity in Victoria and New South Wales than in South Australia. When engaged in gold-digging in the ad joining colony in 1852 several Victorian settlers, for the time similarly engaged, narrated to me extraordinary scenes which they had witnessed in the uncultivated districts of that colony on Black Thurs day. Enormous bush-fires were burning in every direction, sheep and cattle were roasted alive, and several human lives were sacrificed. In some instances, while one fire was rushing and roaring along another conflagration would burst forth a few miles ahead, as if the eager demon of fire had vaulted unseen over the intervening space. It is a curious fact, to which I can personally bear testimony, that the abori ginals of Victoria uniformly attributed the origin of gold to Black Thursday, which immediately preceded its discovery.

The very leaves of the trees cracked, in the heat, and appeared. to be ae inflammable as tinder. As summer advanced the temperature became torrid, and on the morning of February 6, 1851, the wind, which blew from the north, resembled the breath of a furnace. The air was darkened by volumes of smoke, relieved by showers of sparks. The forests were ablaze, and on' the ranges the confla gration transformed their wooded slopes into appalling masses of incandescent columns and arches. A fierce and violent wind blew from the north and north-west, and by some inexplicable means it wrapped the whole country in a sheet of flame— -fierce, awful, and irresistible. The impetuous onrush of the flames left nothing behind but heaps of charred ruins and a pitiable scene. Many lives were lost, valuable property and live stock destroyed, and such devastation as could never be effaced from the recollection of those who had witnessed and survived the* calamity that took place. From the bold promontory of Cape 'Otway, and for the space of 300 miles by 150 miles, and far beyond Goulbum, the Broken Bay River and the Ovens, there remained to be seen traces of the terrible bush fire which took place in February. of .the year 1851. ;",precise,polygon,"numbr of locations, identifying sites in Victoria from Kilmore to the Otways","The wind dashing from the nor^^n. .gusts of inconceivable heat Beefl3pdrifco8tsear the very face and shrivel up the lungs.

Thither shepherds had driven their flocks, stockmen their herds, and whole families, compelled to fly from their burning houses, had hurried thither with the few effects they could snatch up and bear with them. Mr. Carey's paddocks were crowded with horses and cattle, the bush around his station was literally hidden beneath his own and his neighbors' flocks. Shepherds, stockmen, substantial squatters, now houseless men, were in throngs. Families with troops of children had encamped on the open ground near his house beneath temporary tents. Mount Hesse was crammed with fugitives and was one scene of crowding confusion md sorrow. Luckily the store-room was well stocked with flour, and there could be no want of meat with all those flocks and herds about them. But for the cattle themselves there must soon be famine ; and the moment that the fire abated scouts must be sent off in all directions, especially to the high plains around Lake Corangamite, in search of temporary pasture. Meantime fires were lighted in a dozen places, and kettles and frying-pans fully employed, for in spite of flight, loss, and grief, hunger, as Homer a thousand years ago asserted, '' is impudent and will be fed.' The stories people had to tell were most melancholy. Children suffocated in the smoke or lost in the rapid flight ; shepherds and bullock drivers consumed with their stock. Numbers had fled to creeks and pools, and yet bad been severely burnt, the flames driving over the surface of the water with devouring force. Some had lain in shallow brooks turning over and over, till finally forced to get up and fly. Still, as this terrible day — February 6 — wore on, numbers came pouring in with fresh tales of horror and devastation. The -whole country appeared to be a prey to the flames ; and men who a few hours before were out of the reach of poverty and calamity were now homeless paupers.

Pure and powerful and pitiless as Calvin's ideal deity, crueller even than its brother enemy-water. For the sea kills its victims tenderly, folding them to rest in close swaying embrace, kissing them to peace with keen cold kisses, lulling their brief agony with the musical rhythm of many waters, restoring them perhaps -still and white and rigid; with the seal of eternity upon their faces-to light, and to them who wait and watch by the shore. But fire, deadly and insatiable, wraps them with torturing arms, licks them with shining, blistering tongues, bites and stings every inch of tender skin and sensitive flesh with unutter able pain ere yielding them up to death, disfigures and distorts till even they who have loved best and longest are glad to put the hideousness out of sight. All round and about Merlyn Creek raged the bush fire, so that communication between that and other town ships was for the present entirely cut off, and the men of Merlyn Creek waited about anxiously, bearing sacks and big boughs of trees which they had soaked as well as possible in the fast-diminishing brackish fluid in the Good Luck Company's dam. For they said that any increase of wind must inevitably bring the fire in upon them, and they knew their only chance of saving their homes, and perhaps their lives, lay in beating out the flames as they approached. Snakes slid quickly and in numbers into the township, and were slain and left writhing in their dusty tracks.

The thirsty earth all agape in wide cracks for rain which fell not. The grass-no longer grass, but pale-brown dust, floating away with every breath of the hot, hot wind, to join the cloud of sand travelling constantly southward. Sombre pendant foliage, sighing and moaning, living things gasping and panting, all nature wilting and withering under the torture of drought. Earth and air and sky pervaded and darkened by the scent and smoke of burning bush. The creek, a mere piccaninny stream at its best, now resolved into a few muddy, fast evaporating pools with long dry spaces between. The horizon, one band of flame, held under in daytime by the strength of the sun, but by night revealing itself in a fiery circle of hissing, crackling, roaring destruction.

She meets the handsome stranger, Alured (probably Alfred) Pavneham at church and finds her beloved dog is actually his – he is from Norwood Station via Ounmulla Queensland “There are few, if any, of the residents of the Hillswell and Romsey districts who will ever forget the Christmas Day that followed the marriage of Caleb Grunder and Claire Rpmsey. The summer had been an exceptionally hot and dry one, and .as Christmas approached the weather grew more oppressive than ever. The Go vernment tanks on the stock routes had long been dry, the rivers became mere spasmodic watcrholes, and in Hillswell 90 per cent, of the tanks were empty. '
When Christmas Day broke with the thermometer at a hundred and twenty by 9 o* clock in the morning, many of the o!d settlers lookea . grave. A' dense co lnmn of smoke in the eoiith-yest/ about 12 o'clock, quickened they- alarm, 'and asthe guests began to assemble at Hillswell House,- towards 1 o'clock, they noticed with alarm that bushfires were raging on three sides of Hillswell. The township was surrounded oh every ade'by dense mulga scrub and heavy timber, and for this reason many of the guests assembled at Caleb Grunder's would have- started firefighting parties but for the fact that the barometer was falling fast, and there was every promise of a thunderstorm, within a very short time. Heavy masses of cloud 'gathered in the north, and lurid flashes of forked ? lightning battled with the angry red-rimmed _SBKike' clouds that swirled and twisted above 'the timber.Caleb Grunder tep-t on tapping the barometer every few minutes, and saying; 'She's- coming fast; well have -a heavy thunderstorm in 15 minutes now.'' With this assurance, his alarmed puesta sat down to dinner. Within 15 minutes tbe etorm burst— burst Tfcith a sudden andawful fury; but there was' no rain!. Wind, . roaring and howling, travelled over the township at a. cyclonic Nrate, and ere the astonished population of Hillswell 'could '' realise- it,- the bush fires- burst into ' rag ing seas of flame, and raced down upon the doomed township. When, too late, the residents attempted to fight the flames, a mad panic possessed them, and they ran hither and thither to save their lives.
