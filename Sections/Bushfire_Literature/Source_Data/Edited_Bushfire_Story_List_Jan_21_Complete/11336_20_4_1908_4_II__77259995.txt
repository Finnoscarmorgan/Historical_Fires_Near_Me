CHAPTER II. Dinner that night was a cheerful, not to say rowdy, meal. Mrs. Have lock and Bob Darcle, who always1 .sat together and frequently talked of bees, a hobby they had In common, could scarcely make themselves, heard. The -noise came chiefly :irom the foot ot the table, where Gus, Mrs. Darcie, Trlx. and Algy were making merry over old times. Bass had taken Ina in, an-d he did his best to prevent her from feeling 'out of it'— for Gus's atten lionss were given to Mrs. Darcie, and Ina could not understand their allu sions to hunting-, a sport 'in which Trixie's interest apparently centred. 'By the way, Gus,' said that young lady presently, ' 'I've been - exercising The Geisha lately.' 'Then, my dear child, you are a fool'.' ???''. 'Not at all. I like to ride an animal, with spirit as much as you do.. I don't see why women should be condemned to rocking-horses.' Dormer did not appear to recognise that this was a thrust .at him, and went on with his dinner composedly. 'No one's wanting you to ride a rocking-horse,' returned her brother; ''but I'm sure^Pretty One is .as much as you can manage— The Geisha's not half broken.' *^ ' 'I'm going' to have her oTft tomor row.' ' 'Oh, all right; take -your own way!', said Gus, whose anxiety was not' easily aroused. 'Better take, some one .with you who can ride, ? that's all — Dormer, perhaps.' '. . . '?Mr. Dormer?' cried Trixie, v,--lth im pertinent surprise'. ? ^Bass colored a little, but smiled, too. .'Oh, no,' he said composedly, -'I de cline!' ? - ?? ' 'You haven't reformed her yet, then?' laughed Gus. ^ ? 'It will take him some time ,to do' that,' said Trixie, with unnecessary ?heat. -'.-'? ? ., ? . 'I gave up trying long ago,',' he said;' then added as an -after-thought, 'be- sides, you arc perfect as you are, Miss Havelock.' ? ' : Gus 'laughed, and Trixio for once did not answer, but turned away, coloring so hotly that Ina, who was watching, almost fancied she saw tears: If that. were so, Trixie soon recovered, for pre sently, leaning' across the table towards Ina, she changed' the subject by .ask ing— 'Ware you sorry ^to leave Austra lia?' . . ' Ina colored at the suddenness of the question, looked at Havelock, and said, 'No.' ... . ,'She couldn't have said anything else, with Gus listening,' said Mrs. Darcie. , 'You must tell, us- all about it afterwards,' she added, with an air of one postponing an unavoidable if somewhat undesirable conversation. 'I want you to describe a bush-fire to me— I'm writing a novel.' ''It won't be published, so- tell as ?many lies as you like,' said Trixie. ?« Mrs.lHaveIock rose, and Algy sprang to* his feet, upsetting his'chair in his opening, the door. 'Bass, sitting next ?it,- was easily first however, and, as a matter of course ho stood by until the last skirt had trailed through the door way. Airs. Darcie disappeared to:say 'Good night' , to Roly, and the other' three^ drifted into the : drawing-room, where Mrs; Havelock showed a disposition to cross-question her future daughterin .?aw- ? i- ?/.-''? 'You remind me ^of your father, though you are not so good-looking,' she said disapprovingly. 'Sit down here, beside me, m-' dear, I want to have a talk.' ? t - Ina 'sat ? down with vher-back to 'a huge .standard-lamp, ana its red shade shed asoft pink light on her face and dye^d the white of ? her dress a faint rose;. ? : : Trixie- swung round.; on the music stool. .',? ?'-. ? . ? ?? -. -., 'Lsavo her alone to-night,- mother,'* she said; 'she's tired.'', : . - ?

' Trixie shrugged her , shoulders, glanced at the clock, wondering when 'the boys' would come,- and began to play 'The Amorous Goldfish' very softly, listening to the conversation at the other end of the room. . ~ 'Let me see — you lived just out of Sydney, didn't you?' 'Yes.' ? . - . . ?'.?_.. 'Thin I hope, mjvdear, you are fond of a country life. I have a horror of girls who live only for the moment Jean Darcie, for instance. A mother thinks a great deal about 'the woman her. son is to. marry, and I know exact ly what Gus wants— a girl who Is a woman of the world without being worldly, -with -a firm yet -yielding dis position— for, like all men, he expects his own way in most- things; plenty of ambition, for he is terribly' lazy, yet fond of a quiet country life, for I don't approve ' of London. Then he Is far too a:nxioiis for excitement and novelty, and you must try and check it in him. That was what made him propose to you, Ina— there can be no harm In my saying -it, 'considering that- you: have not met for- nine years, which puts love out of the question. I hope you are like that?' 'I don't know, I'm sure,' said poor Ina, looking despondently at the reso lute little woman beside her. Then, with an overwhelming sense of her obligations, she added, 'I'll try to be.'1 ? ''That's right, my dear,'.; said, Mrs. Havelock briskly.' .'It's half the battle, in fact. Now I don't mind telling you that you are not quite what your, photograph- led me to expect— good gracious, child! What' Is it?' Ina had sprung up. and was staring with frightened eyes. at the wiadow. ' 'Something knocked!' she cried. Trixie laughed. 'A bat,' she said scornfully. She was not at all nervous. 'You should not be so nervous,' said Mrs. Havelock severely. 'I should not have expected It. from any one coming: such a distance. What I had 'been going to say was, that I ?had expected you to bo more practical and more common — had more common- . sen?e.'
