 It I eonld have foreseen for one single moment all the dreadful distress that was to follow onMrs. Molyneox's ill-ad need scheme 

 for bringlugour dear youngpeopletogether, I would never bare consented to bare* toneh1 any part in 1t-^heyer! 

 I Was a little nnteaay from tbfe vwy-first moment afae mooted it to me.1 It was delightfully romantic,-1 admit; bat I licit morally convinced that if by any evil chance the faintest hint of it leaked oat and reached dear MaudVears, she would instantly fly off at a dreadful tangent, and there would be 

 terrible work! And bo there was; we were 

 alt plunged into awful misery by the untimely breaking of. the engagement, and I am sure that the pangs of remorse from which I Buf 

 id the buckets of tears that I shed fcrodn adlcL _ 

 over my unfortunate share^ in their un happiness, could never be described, no matter how graphic the pen. 

 In the depths of my own mind I had a secret conviction that there was a lurking latent tenderness for each other in the hearts : of thOBe two, and that, in spite of all this , surface-disagreement, in the end they would ? marry each other, I could give no substan tial reason for this conviction, and Mrs. Molyneux simply laughed the idea to scorn. She was fearful lest some of our numerous visitors might catch each vagrant fancy, she wanted to pot it beyond the edge of doubt, and what the disastrous result of her im patience was we have already teen. 

 The fortnight following the rapture of the engagement was a very painful period. All the wedding preparations were abruptly set aside�fortunately, ths invitations hod not been issued. Jack went away to town, and we tried to take up tbe thread of our ordinary life just as if no calamity had occurred. 

 Maud comported herself beautifully. She was a little paler, and there were certain shadows under her eyes, but her sensitive pride came to her aid, and she has determined that no one should see how deeply she bad been wounded. Dunn has told me since that night after night she has heard her tossing in her bed, and has stolen in to comfort her, j only to find her lying there with eyes tightly shut, counterfeiting sleep; a little useless de ception, frustrated by the fluttering of her eyelids under the candle-light. But Dunn delicately respected the hinted wish for solitude, and crept off again as quietly as she' came, as if she really believed her to be sleeping. . . , ,, ,. 

 Jack came suddenly back from Melbourne, but went to Vectis. The station needed him, and he used to ride over from time to time, give his directions to the overseer, Jim Nash, and return to his solitude at the out station. Sometimes we Baw him for a few minutes, bnt generally he left without enter-1 ing the house at all. Still, it was something to have him about the place, and in time he and Maud met with less constraint than might have been expected under the circum stances. � , 

 Finally a blessed bush fire�I call it blessed advisedly�led to his returning permanently to his own house, for it broke out near the homestead, and he was obliged to remain for a few days till all danger was over, after which there was no reason why he Bhould go away�and be stayed. 

 He was graver, and Maud was more capriciously fascinating than ever. They sel dom addressed each other, though each was, I felt sure.intensely conscious of the other's pre sence; but a stranger not knowing their story would never have guessed at the romance that lay buried under their tranquil manner to each other. Fanny Vaughan waa to re main with ns for another six months, and Hugh Fraser, a great hulking�bnt, I must admit, faithful�tellow, visited us with the 

 most unswerving regularity. And we all did ; our very best, we others, to make the grass | grow green over that grave we knew of. 

 As the winter went on Maud caught cold1 and bad some difficulty in shaking it off. The doctor was called in, and gave as his opinion that Bbe wanted " tone" 

 " Keep her out in the fresh air as much as possible. See that she has plenty of exercise -horse-riding, and that sort of thing. She's not robust, she wants care; bat theres nothing radically wrong," he said, and went bis way. 

 It was one thing to say " Let her ride " and another thing to make her do it. It was always "to-morrow" and "to-morrow" in spite of Mrs. Molyneux's commands, Dunn's coaxings, and Fanny's entreaties. At last Jack took the matter in band, 

 "Selim wants work, Maud," he mid; "he is getting too flash. You really most ride him. I'll bam the horns brought np to morrow at four; I am sure Miss Vanghan will be glad of a ride." 

 Maud flushed scarlet, bnt she assented meekly, to my silent delight 

 When the horses were brought round at the appointed time next day, Jack came out i of his office and mounted the two girls with 

 great care, after which he turned to go in i again. 

 " Where is your horse V asked Maud, look ing after him. 

 " Oh, I am not going," he said, lightly. 

 Maud hit her lip. The ready colour rushed op into her face, and she started off without another word, holding Selim so tightly that he danced off sideways like a cat on hot bricks. 

 " Dear me, Jack, do yon think Selim is safe ?" cried his stepmother. 

 " Safe? Of course he is," said Jack briefly, and re-entered the house. 

 An hour after, when we were all sitting over tbe drawingroom fire, Tom, the groom, came to the window with a scared, white face. 

 " Selim's back, sir�alone," he said, hur riedly. 

 " What the devil do you mean V mid Jack, jumping up, while his stepmother altered a 

 cry. 

 " He come galloping into the stable-yard 

 I'm hfrak 

 this miuit. I'm afraid he's thrown Miss 

 Maud, There's no sign of Miss Vanghan." 

 Jack dashed past him, ran to the stable yard without a bat, mounted Selim, and was off out of Bight like the wind. Ah I the miserable bait-hour of anxiety that followed! 

 Mrs. Molyneux moaned and Wrong her! hands. Dunn stood rigid at the gate, strain ing her eyes to see tbe first movement of re 

 turn. The other servants gathered in little1 groups, pals and frightened, talking in whispers, and Tom busied himself preparing a horse to go for the doctor; But tttrongh all my anxiety one thing haunted me�the look of strained agony on Jack's face as he tnsbed past me ou$ of the house. : Not all the1 asseverations he could hare madewonld have convinced me after that thathe did' not love' Maud passionately; and I had a delicious hope that perhaps Maud was only a little hurt, and that his agitation and thankfulness might betray his real feeling to her, and that' all might come right 

 Presently we heard hones' hoofs; and to our inexpressible delight the two girls came gaily cantering np to the gate, ftil uncon cerned. 

 " My precious girl, what a fright you have given ns!" cried Mrs. Molyneux, ,amid a general chorus of relief from everyone, 

 " Have I f said Maud, carelessly. " I^ot 

 off to tighten my girth, and Selim polled 

 suddenly away, Did you think I was killed, my darling old Dunn r ' :

 But to the patient all things arrive at last They wereplaying tennis,one afternoon!. Maud and Hugh Fraatr against Fanny and Jack., and the latter badi won every up. greatly to the detriment of Mr. Fraser*a teomet. He bad a slumbering jealousy of Jack, that made bun take even such a trivial thing as a beating at tennis, very hardly at his hands, and to-day Maud had not . played her very best, which made him worse. 

 As they stood talking over their late-fonoht battle, Jack's horse, Highflyer, passed leisurelv 

 along stablewarda beyond the fence. 

 "What is that great camel of a beast. Molv. neux?" asked Mr.Fraser. "Idon'tcemem 

 ber seeing him before." 

 " My favonrite horse, Highflyer," said Jack 

 briefly. 

 "And the brat jumper in the district." added Fanny Vanghan. ^ 

 " Really?" said Mr. Fraser, with a faint sneer, "he doesn't look like it. Xshould think he wanted catefill steering andiifting 

 at his fences." 

 Jade laughed. 

 " I've taken him over every fence about the place," he eaid, "without saddle or bridle." 

 "Ah yes, indeed i" said Mrs. Holynenr. shaking her head. " You are too recking" 

 Jack. Jim Nash told meonoe that be fell: with you over the cultivation paddock ton... and that when he got up he set his foot on your neck. ; Jim said that if it had not been ploughed ground von must have been killed." 

 " Jim is too long-tongued," said Jack care lessly. " Yes, that time it felt very like 

 death." 

 " I should like to see bim jump," said Mr. 

 Fraser. 

 "Very well," said Jack. "HI take him over any fence you like�say (he one below, the stables�backward and forward, without saddle or bridle, now. Gome on." 

 we all went, though for my part I hate that sort of thing. Two great scarlet- spots were on Maud's cheeks till Bhe saw Jack on High flyer without eaddle or .bridle, sitting with folded arms. Then ehe went as white as a sheet, and looked up at him dumbly implor ing, but he did not appear to notice that pathetic look. I did, and my heart leaped np with unfeigned joy. 

 Jack rode him at the fence, and the horse cleared it barely, striking it ever so Blightly as he went over. Before he turned round to jump him back again,. Maud, with a little inarticulate Bound, had pnt her hands np to her face, and fled tor dear life to the bam. She conld not bear to look on. 

 Bnt Highflyer was on bis mettle now. He rose at the fence grandly, clearing it like a bird, among general acclamations. 

 " Why, where'a Maud?" said Jack, his iace falling slightly as he rejoined as. 

 " She ran to the bain, Bir, after the first jump," said Tom, the groom, demurely. 

 " She couldn't bear to look on," 1 whis pered. 

 He looked at me for one minute, slipped off his horse, and made for the barn. Mr. Fraser took in the situation, ground his teeth audibly, rolled his soft hat into a shapeless ball, and stalked away towards the bouse. 

 Dunn, under the impression that her darling was feeling ill, turned and hurried off to the barn, and I aped after her, execrating her stupidity. 

 "Come back, come back, you aggravating old woman," I said as soon as I was near enough to speak. . . 

 She merely gave me a backward glance of contemptuous, - though respectful, surprise, 

 and hurried on. faster still. 

 She had actually reached the barn door before 1 caught her by the skirt and held ber fast. I was determined that-she should not pass in unless over my prostrate body! 

 While she was amazedly trying to tree her self we beard Maud say in a voice so tremulous with happiness that it sent the team into my 

 eyee� 

 "Jack, Jack, promise me that you 11 never be eo reckless again 1" 

 "I promise, mydearest, my tife,my wife r Jack answered, and then followed�a kiss i 

 Dunn and I looked at each other in utter rapture, and stole silently away. 

 And If who had bo much to do with putting things wrong in the first instance, have now the inexpressible happiness of knowing that in my insignificant way I have been able to help in setting them right again.
