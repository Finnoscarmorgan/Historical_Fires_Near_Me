 OHAfiTER XXV.� THE GLEN OF ?????'? ADULLAM. 

 If there was ope thing which galled Balathibl more than another it was to be held up to ridicule, and the affair at Baker's Creek made him the laughing stock .01 the colony. It was the first really serious reverse he had experienced since taking to the bush. Notwithstanding his elaborate get-up a9 a clergyman and the capture of the troopers by his men, he bad 

 oeen i-narougmy outwitted by superior stratagem. He had reason to believe, also, that he 'was losing his influence over (some of th� gang, for he knew they were laughing at him with the rest. He had overheard Dandy Snow say to Xed Fenton� 'Imagine thousands of jwunds in gold and cash being carted away in a bale of wool under one's very nose and the captain being tricked by the yellow glitter of a lot of copper ore. It'a too ridiculous, lads! We ought to make that Ned Chipman and his firm sit up .for it; eome of them would laugh an other, way then.' But Salafchiel would not hear of any pal try show of spite of this sort. 'They have beaten us this time,' he said; 'let's take our gruel kindly ;-our turn will come later on if we have patience.' Rut there was another matter which an noyed Javk and further humiliated him. He had broken faith with his sister Ruth and gained nothing by it; and he had de Btroynd all the high hopes of Betsy, that he would have nothing . more to do with common highway robbery. It. should be explained that the visit of Thompson to Salathiel while at the Valley had parciy to do with a considerable for tune which had come to Salathiel through the sudden death of a relative. As an out law, any property he possessed was for feited to the Crown; but he had signed transfers to his sister, and her lawyer had managed to get the matter through. Ruth had agreed to hold Jack's interest in her own name, and send him the income and proceeds, on condition that he acted only on the defensive and refrained from any robberies on the road. He had allowed himself, however to Joe drawn into the ''sticking up' of Browne and Co.'s gofd to gratify the gang, and 'having committed hiuuelf to the affair, ?had carried it through with very unneces sary ostentation and bravado. He had now a secret income which supplied him with ample means to keep himself and his grine in comfort, until such time as they could make good their escape from Au?t'.i ;a. But the Baker's Creek affair had been an utter and public failure, -and Saiatiu'eJ be gan to ask himseif whecher a supernatural power might not have prevented him ac tually mealing the gold, not for his own take, but for the sake of Ruth and Betsy. It will lie hard to explain to the reader how lonely and isolated Salathiel's life at this time really was. The gang shared his money, but they had very few thoughts in common with him; they could not un- j derstand him, and were fast losing confi dence in him as a leader. The newspapers of the colony were ridiculing him as a fustigated highway-robber, and the gang grew daily more restless and dissatisfied with his leadership. He was too, bad for eome people and too good for o&h'ers; and it put him in that perilous position which i is popularly described as being between | the devil and the deep sea. In fact, he j was iust now in danger of becoming a :, worse criminal, and a much ' more dan- ; gerous man than he had been before. If, ! on account of this last escapade, his Bister, or Betsy had thrown him over as a reprehensible renegade, he would pro bably, in despair, have had recourse to i deeper crime and violence. But, as soon as the failure to steal Browne and Co.'a gold became known, Ruth managed to send him a considerable sum of money, and Betsy wrote, boldly congratulating him upon zhe faihire of hi6 attempt to rob the Maitland rirni. He took Ruth's money and burnt Betsy's letter, and, engrossed in his own thoughts, held himself still more aloof from the gang. The men's dissappointment was keen. They had planned this as their big coup-de grace, aud had hoped to divide the gold and disperse with the spoil, for under the influence of Salathiel) most of them had become convinced that the game of bush ranging was not worth the candle and Would only lead to the gallows. But a new danger threatened; Salathiel'e rocky fastness in the Liverpool Ranges was becoming a sort of cave of Adullam, to which desperate criminals, as well as those who were driven into bushranging by misfortune and ill- treatment, resorted. Coarse, brutal thieves and murderers were 4n hiding there, who thought they had a right to be hail-fellow-well-met with Sa lathiel and his gang; and for his ? own eafcty and that of his men he dared not open ly . quarrel with them. It will be seen that things were fast Japproaching a crisis; robberies and crimes i with which Salathiel and his gang bad no- 1 thing to do, but for which they were in- 1 variably blamed, were of frequent occur- \\ rence. The police were increasingly active, | large rewards were offered for the capture ' of bushrangers dead or alive; and in the | case of convicts who gave information, or ?assisted m the apprehension of ' bush rangers, a free pardon was promised and ' e free passage home. There wa6 even talk j of an organised effort, on the part of the J Government, to storm the almost impreg nable fastnesses which were the haunts of three desperadoes. Qu coming into bis new .weaJih Balathiel had decided at the first favorable opportunity to leave Aus tralia: but he would not run away and de sert the men who had made him their chief, 60 he determined to take the bull by the-faorns, and by careful organisation and force of arms, secure absolute command over the outlaws of the district. He de cided upon this after a long conference with his men; and, with their approval, ?admitted a few of the more reliable ex- ! convicts into the gang, and then let it be known through the district that enjy such road and other robberies as were arranged j $-y him would be permitted. Salathiel in- - (tended that there should be no more such crimes of violence: but it would not do for him to make this known at present. He 

 still intended to make the colony pay tri bute to hiinself and his gang, but he would do it in a more . civilised way. The effect of this was a notable decrease of ordinary crimes of violence all over the district, and people began to breathe more freely, while the authorities, without relax ing their vigilance, carefully watched to see how Salatfaiel'e new regime would eventuate. It was believed that some of the worst criminals had banded themselves together to destroy Salathiel, and that fighting was. going on in the ranges be tween Salathieil's gang and other less civi lised outlawe. It was at this time that Eiirinrbla Station was 'stuck up' by the Gilbert gang; and Joe Brady, the station bookkeeper and Jack's old friend, was bru tally murdered in cold blood. Within three days afterward,, two no torious outlaws and murderers, George Gilbert and Pat Morgan, who had led the attack upon the station, and been seen in the act of murdering Brady, were found dead, hanging by the neck from trees upon the Maitland road. A notice was attached to the bodies which ran as follows: � 'Executed after full inquiry and proof of guilt, for the brutal murder of Joe Brady, a white nian and deserving citizen. 'By order, J. J Salathiel.' The effect of this exhibition of lynch law was many-sided. It made Salathiel not a few enemies among the criminals who were, like himself, outlaws in the bush; and the authorities, newspapers, and gene ral public did not know now to take, it. They rejoiced at the death of two blood thirsty scoundrels; but they rejoiced with trembling, for this was a. subversion of authority which might result in. unex pected deeds of .violence. The man wh.o was capable of taking the law into his own hands in this fashion was equal to anything. ? But itw as force of circumstances rather than choice which was driving Sala thiel into desperate courses. Living much alone in a cave which overlooked the re markable glen he and his gang occupied, he was fast becoming a fanatical misanthrope. Sentinels were posted at every pqint of access, and he enforced his will upon tho members of the e.inst, whom he had now 

 i sworn to render him implicit and unques tioning obedience. He brooded over his wrongs, and the hopelessness of his en vironment, and imagined himself a mo dern David, in a cave of Adullara, under divine protection. His hallucination made him absolutely fearless of others and reek loss of his own life. He believed himsell supematurally guided by -voices, visions, and dreams, immune from ordinary mor tals ills, a man whom no weapon could wound. 'His enemies sought him, but found him not, because God delivered him not into their hands.' Be spent whole days and nights reading the old Jewish Scriptures, and atahied an ascendency over the gang such as is usually associated only with rp ligions and superstitious fanaticism; he had feecome as hard and inflexible as the lone, rugged mountain stronghold in which he 'had been forced to make his home. For the time he became the dictator and terror, for good or evil, of the whole district; and the only people who bene fitcd much by his remarkable re gime were e the convicts, who were protected against ill - treatment by the fear of a visit from the gang. In such cases Salathiel would flog die of fenders and levy heavy fines upon them, which were collected in a summary fashion. Salathiel called these visitations 'Acts of justice'; but the authorities called them, 'Robbery under arms.' On occasion, a whole township would b'e held up by Salathiel, while he inquired into charges, laid against individuals or insti tutions, and if he could get a good case against a hank it was invariably mulcted in heavy penalties. All this, was in abso lute defiance of law and order, but it went on through out the winter and ?pring without any specially organised effort on the pert of the Government to put it down. Ordinary highway robbery had prac tically ceased; but a new tenor had arisen which, although, to some extent, it made for law aud order, was, as a whole, intole rable. By evil-doers of all classes, and* they formed a good proportion of thf- commu nity, Salathiel's rbugh.-and-ready reme. dies were regarded as worse than the di sease. ' CHAPTER XXVI.� FOES IN COUNCIL. The folowing summer was the hottest and most trying of any recorded for niany years. A drought had set in at the end of September, and January came without any sign of general rain. People were depressed and irritable, money was scarce, and Sa iatliiel- had lecently imposed a Sue of one' thousand pounds upon a leading bank, and collected ft in his usual summary fashion in fifty pounds notes. The bunk had foreclosed in ^a har^h and arbitrary manner upon a station property belonging to the widow of a highly es teemed squatter recently decensca. The station manager had' done his oast, fight ing the drought and other evils, day and night, on behalf of the widow and her children, and paying nine per cent. in terest; but one trouble had succeeded unother, and the interest payments had fallen considerably in arrears. The local bank 'manager had been called, to task for . allowing th� account to ruu up, and was instructed by his head office to file a bill for foreclosure, compelling the widow at once to redeem the property or for feit her riehts. 'You knew, my dear madam.' said the bank manager to the weeping widow, 'it is very hard for ine to do this; but busi ness is business, and I liave ray instruc tions from Sydney'.' It was well known, however, that the property was of exceptional value, and that a couple of good seasons would, probably, not only pay off tbe whole mortgage, but :nl-l , a thousand or , i�v iu tho Dilation account. The bank how-t ever, had a buyer in . . view, the widow was in debt, and her account unprofitable, so she had to go. One morning, in Jier shabby lodgings in Sydney, however, she received an anony mous gift of a thousand pounds in bank notes. It made the 'widow's -heart' leap for joy. but, as request by the auony 

 toous : donor, she said-nothinji to anyone about it. It was a' trifle less than the Jainoun* of profit thfe' bank had made -by the i .sale *-I the- Station. ? ?. '?? � '? Salathiel had .told the manager that he was acting on behalf of the widow, and ^orphans, but without their knowledge, ro. Mr. Screwali, of the bant, was sent W) her Sydney address with a plausible' ex cuse to try. to discover whether . she had received this money or riot. Being a Wise woman. : however, she saw through the .dodgp-.and held her peace. 'It will never do, Captain Moore, to have this state .of things, continuing,' said the Commissioner of Police one morning to his colleague. 'Salafthiel will have to iw taken, dead or alive, and you will have to do it quiekly. His audacity passes all bounds. We shall have him coming down to Sydney with his pistol, demand ing 'a departmental enquiry into' the work ing of the office. But. joking aside, the Chief Justice is terribly put out about this bank business; he says it is casting ridicule upon our high courts of justice, and that for Sala-thiel to be at large is a disgrace to the administration of the colony.' 'That is all very well,' replied Captain Moore, 'but will yon tell me how the thing ie to be done? To send any large body of men up into the Liverpool Ranges at present would only be to send them to their death. You have no idea of the wild and inaccessible nature of the coun try, and the multitude of 'bush telegraphs' and other people Salathiel has in his pay. We have sent some of our beet men up there in squads and alone, in all sorts of dif guises� some of the best bushmen we had in the force. The last one� who would go aloner-was absolutely lost in the bush there. . He travelled around in circles for some days, then went off his head a bit, and let his horse go. Lo_sing all hope of rescue, he made his will, and wrote to headquarters on -the leather flap of his .saddle, and, exhausted and- delirious, lay down to die: some of Salathiel's men found him at the last gasp, and nursed him back to life in the hollow trunk of a great giuntree, where he says he saw bunks fixed up for six men. His horse was. found for him, and they led him miles through the bush blindfolded, and putting him on the main track, warned him not to show himself in those parts agair or he would be shot on eight.' 'It is useless,' he contimied 'to at tempt to take these outlaws in their bush resorts. Our prominent citizens and poli ticians, who rail at the police for riot cap turing them, have no conception whatever of the wild fastness in whieh these men live; and as for busfaerafl, there are very few men in the force who know any thing about it. Our only chance is to get one of their own men to betray them or catch them in the open country.' 'Could not you trap Salathiel in some way?' said the Commissioner. 'Are there no relatives or friends with whom he cor responds, or keeps in touch? 'I have tried thait in half a dozen ways,' replied the captain. 'I am in formed by a man called Silas Stump that there is a settler's daughter in the Bluff Valley, down on the 'south coast, who occasionally receives letters from him (you remember, he personated a school-teacher there named Bennett) ; then, the daughter of old Salathie], of Drosena & Co., is sup posed to be in touch with him, and Lieu tenant Thompson, of the mounted infantry, is a sort of connection; but you can't prove anything or do anything with these people. I suggested to the lieutenant that he should make an appointment with Salathiel. ' and blow his brains out while he signed his name to a document. But he ordered me out of has house.' 'fm not surprised at that; it would be next door to murder to shoot a man in that cowardly fashion,' said the Com missioner. . 'But he's an outlaw,' replied the cap tain, 'and we want to get rid of him.' 'That is so; .but he- is a clever and brave man, outlaw and faini'tac as he is! He's not a man one would care to kill like a rat in. a hole. Can't you suggest some pldp by which he might be cap tured in a decent and honorable.' way? I believe -the Governor would double the reward, and it would be a gireat thing for .^y our reputation if you were success ful- .' You're a good bushman. they cay; why don't you go up yourself, and take half,,* dozen men wi'th you in disguise? . ' ; . . Phew! How hot it is! They say miles of bush are burning, and that crops and settlers' homes are suffering terribly.' '.' . ... 'I have an idea,' said Captain .Moore, after -a long pause, duringv which a good deal of tobacco was ^ burnt, for both gentlemen were smofing; 'if these hot winds continue for another week I think i't might be worth while to try and smoke Salathiel out. We're almost cer tain to suffocate some of them.' 'But it's a serious criminal offence to fire the bush, especially in such terrible weather as this. ' Did you see the 'Gazette' this morning? The' thermo meter yesterday afternoon was one .hun dred and seven in the tfhade, and the heat at Parramatta, . made worse by,, the bush fires, was so excessive that immense numbers of large fox-bats were seen to drop dead from the trees, and in other pla-ces the ground was covered with small birds, eome dead, others gasping for water. The wind was north-west and burnt up everything before it; bush fires have broken out in all directions. Surely, it would be an awful thing to add to the general calamity by Srisg the bush. �ven to destroy a gang of bushrangers!' 'Necessity know,s no law,' replied the captaic ostentatiously; 'this man has to be killed or captured, and the present is a chance in a, thousand. Look at this rough sketch of Salathiel's lair in the ranges. It has come to me from a trust worthy source; see, there are only three tracks which give access to 'the glen, and they wind for miles through most rugged and inaccessible country, all thickly tim bered. The glen� they callit Adullain, I believe� is surrounded on all sides by ?heavy ' timber, and there are plenty of trees growing down in it. If we could onoe get the forest fairly alight with a strong: hot wind blowing from -tlbe north west I am inclined to think that we might, by good luck, suffocate- the whole box and dice of them; the glen *would become a perfect oven.' 'It is an awful proposition,' said the Commissioner, in a non-committal voice; 'but if you go up, you might fall in with him elsewhere, and capture or. shoot him, without resorting to such a' desperate course ? as you suggest.' ' , The matter was left there, ae question able matters often are by people in power, without anything definite being decided; but it was understood that Cap- tain Moore was to go nortr and take as many picked men with him as he thought advisable. Dead or alive, by hook or by crook, Salarhiel was to pe 'taken* ? ^ - ?'.' . . . ???: 

 .?Captain Moore's secret was well kept; but several weeks passed before he left Sydney for Maitland, for a eoufheriy gale, with thunder and lightning and;rein ahd ha-il, put out the bush fires, and brought temporary relief to the gasnfhg citizens. The captain, however, had only told the Commissioner a portion of hie story, for already he had elaborate plans made for w'bat he called, 'Smoking Salathiel out.' CHAPTER XXVH.-THE LIVERPOOL RANGES. Part of Jack's letter from the school house to Betey's mother was: � 'If, by chance any of you should fall into the hands of outlaws, say- 'I'm a Carey.' ' Pro bably, when written, Salathiel attached but slight importance to the phrase; but it was one of the flashes from brain to pen which make pivots- on ?wjhieh histody turns. -Bob was a Carey, and accordingly he was chosen to be the travelling companion of Anios Gordon to Salathiel's stronghold is the Northern Ranges. It came about in this way. For several anxious months no letter from Salathiel had reached the Valley farm, when one morning Captain Fraser, of the Nancy Lee, unexpectedly appeared in company with Amos Gordon. They were the bearers of letters from Salathiel, for he had found that Silas Stump, postmaster for the dis trict, was not to be. trusted. There was one for Mrs. Carey, and one for Betsy, which, judging by the brightness of her .eyes and somewhat excited demeanor, con tained good news. It would appear that during the months of silence Ruth Salathiel, with Lieutenant Thompson and Captain Fraeer, had ar ranged a plan for Jack's escape from Aub tralia to America, with certain of hie men; but it was necessary that the details of the matter and other business -should be more fully set forth, by a responsible and trustworthy representative; Co Amos Gor don had been chosen for the difficult and dangerous task, as one to whom no suspi cion could well attach, and Bob, being young and strong, was to go with him. The Nancy Lee was lying at the Bailey River anchorage, and what was now needed was that Mr. and Mrs. Carey should agree to certain proposals regarding Bob and Betsy. The result of a lengthy conference was that Amos Gordon, with Betsy and her brother Bob, became passengers by the schooner to Newcastle, via Sydney, and if tbe state of the Hunter River permitted, by etesmer up to Morpeth, where Mrs. Carey had a married sister living w'to would be pleased to have Betsy as a visitor. while her brother and Amos Gordon visited the stronghold in the Ranges. Sa lathie] had begged them to let Betsy go, that he might see her once more before leaving Australia. Fortunately, it was the long summer school vacation, so no ex planation ned be given to anybody about Betsy's trip. Thus it came about that a week later 'the Nancy Lee, with Amos Gordon, Bob, Betsy, and other passengers, was passed by the - Sophia Jane, the regular Newcastle steam packet, with Captain Moore and six constables on board, all carefully dis guised as men of various calh'ngs, and ap parently strangers to each other. So al though for different reasons, all these people -were travelling Maitland way. each deeply interested in the lonely bushranger, who from bis stronghold- in the Liverpool Ranges was now the outlaw autocrat of ! the northern district. On 'their arrival at Morpeth, Amos was j not a little surprised to find how generally ' well-affected the people of the north were . towards Salathiel. | 'He has done what the Government and | police couldn't,' said a burly drover, who made no secret of the fact that he carried money with him to buy cattle. 'The nor thern roads,' said he, 'are now as safe for travellers as George-street in Sydney. Whatever mistakes he and his men may j make in regard to squatters and business I people, there's a rough-and-ready fairness abou.t his methods and summary adminis tration of bush law which has put a whole some fear into the minds of a good many folk who bad previously robbed the widow ; and the fatherless, and trodden down the I poor and needy when they thought they could do it with a whole skin.' i After they had left Betsy in safe cus ?tody'with an auiit. who gave her a cordial welcome, Amos and Bob betook them to the Royal Mail Hotel, where the attentive host showed them great deference. Two useful horses, with all that was necessary for their equipment, were in readiness. Their meals were Eerved in a private room, and their ?leeping-apartment was the best in the hotel. 'Everything has been paid for. sir,' said the landlord respectfully when Amos asked* him for the bill. 'You will find beds be spoke for you at the Queen's Hotel, Patrick's Plains, which is probably as far as you will care to ride the first day.' 'J)o you know where I am going to?' asked Amos abruptly, who was not best pleased with the arrangement, and would nave preferred 'to pay his own way. 'No. sir, I do not, but_ I am ordered to hold myself at your service.' Amos could get nothing more from the man, but it suggested to him the respect, or fear, with which Salathiel had come to be regarded. Bob was ela'ted at the atten tion shown to them, and although he said nothing, attributed it to the fact that he was a Carey. .The morning of the third day found 'them travelling through an Australian e�ca Ivptus forest due north of Jerry's Plains. They had been overtaken in the. early morning by a young fellow riding a well bred horse, who said that he was looking for stray cattle. He had the appearance of a Eftockmnn. except that in addition to the stock-whip slung on his saddle, he carried a short rifle and pistols in his saddle holsters; although that was common enough in tBose days with travelling bush men. Amos and Bob had been cautioned ; not to mention the bushranger's name, for i fear of meeting with-, disguised police officers, so they travelled- on for an hour, making ? almost due: north, as they had been direet--d.~ Their companion told them 

 that his name ^was. Geoi^eJLiennca, vtJSa*. ^ I*.8 Ration, but whether he was orife of S balatfaiel s gaoa ^r a disguised trooper waa an open quesfidta TOjal)6th Amc*^ and . -Bob. ? _ ' '.-'.?' .'J ?'?-?'.!?. ? .- ? -'-??; At the end of an Sour . Amos -V and :, ?Bob began to feel uncomfortable about thi� * man; he was very friendly and ^inclined - to be talkative, but Amos thought, ha knew too much abouit Sydney and iooTlittle .^ about the buBh to be a station hand from ? ^ Cassilis, so, in jorder to draw him put he began to talk about a doctor who had re- ''- cently been bushed and was nearly perish ing ; within coo-ee of a station. * lney had crossed a dry watercourse, and Amos, who was a good bushman and had no intention of trusting himself* to :? tha guidance of a stranger, pulled up a moment to make sure as to which way the wates ran when flowing there, for he knew that a)l the creefes on that side of the -range must run south. Having satisfied himself. ne( cantered after hia companions. It & singular,' he said to Lennox, 'that so many otherwise capable 'men -should lack the ordinary habite of observation ne cessary for safety in the bush. 1 .believe one reason why -the Australian bush ha� been decried as monotonous andunin. teresting, is that so few people in Aus- �: traha know much about it.' ' 'You're right there,' said Lennox. 'I don t profess to be an expert bushman my Eelf. I can find my way over the foot hills here to Cassilis Station; yet a few ?-'.: mdes farther north, in the broken country, which is even more heavily timbered than this, one gully^is 8o like another that to travel for days in a circle is far easier than inexperienced people think.' 'By the way, said Amos', de termined to end the suspense and to find out who the man was, 'I don't think 1 introduced my young friend Mr. Carey to you. He's from the south coast. Lake enough, you never heard the name before.' The scockman smiled, and said, 'You might have introduced your friend be fore. Mr. Gordon'; then leaning over he held out his hand to Bob, and as they shook said, 'The Careys are friends of Mr. Bennett, I believe: that's quite enough lot me. We'll canter a bit if you don't mind; the coumtry is fairly level for the next few miles; after that we shall have a bit of climbing to do.' It was a relief to both Amos and Gor don to know that they had fallen into friendly bands, and they followed Lennox . with alacrity, until he presently pulled up again and s-ettled down into the busbman'a steady jog, which in this case meant some thing over four miles an hour. - They soon remarked the growing wild ness of the bush scenery- There was no track, but their guide lit his pipe and! jogged along with 'the confidence of one who is perfectly familiar with his sur- roundings. George Lennox, notwithstanding his pra, vious disclaimer, was an expert bushman. and your expert Australian bushman is one ol tue most sell-possessed ol indi viduals. He seldom hurries himself, yet is always on the move, and never gets put out whateveV happens. If he has lost hia bearings and there is no sun, he sits calmly down and smokes a pipe while hia horee feeds. He knows the lie of the - country and fall of its waters, and thai certain roads and townships are north or south, or east or west, as 'the case may be* The growth of the lower branches of tha big trees, -or the moss on their round butts, or the hang of the shredded bark of the* gums, tell him ithe points of the compass. He is a man of infinite resource eo far as the bush is concerned, and if you can' get him to talk about it, will interest and'- ran prise you as' he interprets the many nar tural signs and voices which guide the ex perienced horseman 'through the great wild tranquil spares of the primeval forests and bushlands of Australia. 'We'll keep a bit more to the right,'* said Lennox: 'it'll gave a few mile* to go up this gorge. There are some etraiigett about to the -sowth-east- but by thi3 tings ' ? our look-outs should know all about them.' Amos and Bob turned their horses paa|' some wild cherry trees to fouW their guide up a stony pinch, in ?the direction of a gloomy - looking gorge. - They were wondering liow the man obtained . his information;, but it took them all their tune, on such a path, -to look after their horses. It was about the last place that an ordinary traveller would nave chosen to climb th^ gorge on horseback, and yet it vas t'lfl only possible entrance for miles. The loaaS preacher and Bob Carey had no idea now of locality or direction; but they were making for Oxley'o Peak, the , highest point of the Liverpool Ranges, soriie fo\\xt thousand feet above sea-level. The bushranger presently pulled up under some trees upon a tiny plateau, to -let th i sweating horses blow a bit, for the heaf was great. The view to the south extended for many miles, but nothing was tcf be seen save the tops of gum-icrees, . winds' spread at .their feet in a great sea of oarfc Sombre foliage. 'How. do you know that �there ar� strangers about?' asked Amos, 'By the cries and movements of.' the '~ ? birds,' replied their guide. 'The crows. and magpies are the best 'bush telegraphs' we' have. They scent a new chum for miles, and hang about his track, and pass the word along to the others, until the whole ;; forest is' on the alert; they are cunning . ?''- rascals though; we only just saved one of Moore's men a few weeks ago: he had been , bushed for several days in the north-west ; .- . ; gullies and was lying insensible with hit face exposed. If he had been a bushman ha would nave pulled his hat right over hia \\-X.\\ eyes for protection fromicroWs and mag- - ,'? pies; but these chaps they'.send up from Sydney are poor bushmeiu -Ve mostly keep out of 'their way, just leave/. them ak-ne-^� ~ -. the ranges do the rest.7/- ?,.'..;, , ?% Lennox was right about the tir'fts: crow* and veen magpies will. pick out ''theypyes of :'; unconscious men as .

He scents misfortune from afar, j fi� gathers in scores from unknown regions, ; feri woe betide the helpless man who lies frith his face unguarded from his fierce at - jacks! With his last consciousness the : bounded bushman instinctively pulls his j . joft felt hat over his eyes and face, i (�? a protection against these black i Jnaraudcre. Bob Carey had been used to rough country, but after thirteen hours in. the toddle lie told Amos that lie gave this trip be*t. For half an hour of the time jliey un'i been blindloiacd and led by toembpr* of the gang, ivlio had come mys teriously upon them.
