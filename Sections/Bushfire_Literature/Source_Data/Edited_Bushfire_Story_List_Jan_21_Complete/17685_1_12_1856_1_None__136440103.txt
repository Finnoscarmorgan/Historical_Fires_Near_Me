 BLACK THURSDAY. 

 ( From the Household Words.) 

 As the voyager approaches the shores of Vic toria, the first welcome land which greets him, is the bold promontory of Cape Otway. If it be at night, the blaze from the light-house on its southern point sends him its cheering welcome for many a league across the ocean which he has so long traversed in expectation, and calls forth 

 rapturous hurrahs from the throng of passengers who crowd to the forecastle. If it be day, the eye rests on its lofty forest hills with a quiet and singular delight. These heights fully respond to the ideal of a new land only recently peopled. Clothed with forests from the margin of the sea to their very summits, they realise vividly the ap proach to a vast region ef primaeval nature. The tall white stems of the gum-trees stand thickly side by side like so many hoary columns ; and here and there amongst them descend dark ravines; while piles of r.ocks on the heights, alternating with jagged cltines and projecting spurs of the mountains, present their solitary masses to the breeze of '-ocean. I Amongst the rocks of this wild shore there are sea-caves of vast extent and solemn aspect, which have never yet been thoroughly explored. The forest, extending fifty miles or more in all direc tions, is one of the most dense and savage in the whole colony. Until lately it was almost im passable from the density of the scrub, and from the thick masses of vines (that is lianas, or creep ing cord-like plants, chiefly parasitical) which, as in the forests of South America, climb from tree to tree, knitting the woods into an obscure and impenetrable shade. Excepting along the track from Mr. Roadknight's station, near the sources of the Barivan, through the heart of the forest to Apollo Bay, a distance of forty miles, you might cut. your way with an axe, but would find it diffi cult to make progress otherwise. The greater part of the promontory � consisting of steep hills covered with gigantic trees intersected by shelving valleys, and dark with congregated fern-trees, beetling precipices, and stony declivities � affords no food for cattle. In one day, however, known to the colonists as Black Thursday, a hurricane of flame opened its rude and impracticable wil derness to the foot of man ; but presented him at the same time, with a black and blasted chaos of charred trees, and gigantic fallen trunks and branehes. It was in this forest, in the early morning of this memorable day, the 6th of February, 1851, that a young man opened his eyes and sat up to look about him. He had, the day before, driven a herd of fifty bullocks from the station of Mr. Roadknight thus far on his way towards his own residence in the country, between Lake Coranga mite and Mount Gellibrand. lie had reached' at evening a small grassy valley in the outskirts of the forest watered by a creek falling into the western Barwan, and had there paused for the night. His mob of cattle, tired and hungry, were not inclined to stray from the rich pasturage be fore them ; and, hobbling out his splendid* black horse Sorcerer, he prepared to pass the night in the simple fashion of the settler 011 such journeys. A fallen log supplied liini witli a convenient seat, a fire was quickly lit from tho dead boughs which lay plentifully around, and his quart-pot, re plenished at the creek, was thrust into the glowing fire. Pie had a good store of kangaroosand 

 wiches, and there he sat with his cup of strong bush-tea ; looking alternately at the grazing cattle, and into the solemn, gloomy, and soundless woods, in which even the laughing jackass failed to shout his clamorous adieu to the falling day. Only the distant monotone of the morepork � the nocturnal cuckoo of the Australian wilds� reached, his ear, making the profound solitude still more solitary. He very soon rolled himself in his travelling rug, and flung himself down before the fire � having previously piled a fresh supply of timber upon it � near where his trusty dogs lay, and where Sor cerer, in the favorite fashion of the bush-horse, slept as he stood. The morning was hushed and breathless. In stead of that bracing chill with which the Austra lian lodger out of doors generally wakes up, Robert Patterson found the perspiration, standing thick on his face, and he felt a strange longing for a deep breath of fresh air. But motion there was none, except in the little creek which trickled with a fresh and inviting aspect at a few yards from him. He arose, and stripping, plunged into the deepest spot of it that he could find ; and thus refreshed, rekindled his fire, and made his solitary breakfast. But all around him hung, as it were, a leaden and death-like heaviness. Not a bough nor a blade of grass was moved by the air. The trees stood . inanimately moody and sullen. He cast his eyes through the gloomy shadow beneath them, and a sultry suffocating density seemed to charge the atmosphere. The sky above him was dimmed by a grey haze. ' There is something in the wind to-day old fellow,' he said, addressing his horse in his usual way : for he had long looked on him as a com panion, and firmly believed that he understood all. that he said to him. ' There is something in the wind : yet, where is the wind 1 ' The perspiration streamed from him with the mere exertion of saddling his horse, and as he mounted him to rouse up his cattle. Horse, dogs, and cattle manifested a listlessness that only an extraordinary condition of the atmosphere could produce. If you had seen the tall, handsome young man seated on his tall and noble horse, you would have felt that they were together formed for any exploit of strength and speed. But the whole troop � cattle, man, horse � went slowly and soberly along, as if they were oppressed by a great fatigue or the extreme exhaustion of famine. The forest clcsed in upon them again, and they proceeded along a narrow track, flanked 011 each side by tall and densely-growing trees -r the creep ing vines making of the whole forest one intricate, impenetrable scene. All was hushed as at mid night. No bird enlivened the solitude by its cries, and they had left the little stream. Suddenly there came a puff of air ; but it was like the air from the jaws of a furnace, hot, dry, withering in its very touch. The young settler looked quickly in the direction from which it came, and instantly shouted to the cattle before him, in a wild, abrupt, startling shout, swung aloft the stock-whip which' he held in his hand, and brought it down with the report of a pistol, and the sharp cut as with a knife, on the ear of the huge bullock just before him. Loud and louder, wilder and more fiercely shouted the squatter, and dashed his horse over fallen trees ; through crashing thickets, first on one side of the road, and then on the other. Crack, crack went the stinging, slashing whip ; loud was the bark of dogs ; and the mob of cattle ruelied forward at headlong speed. The young man gazed upward ; and, through the only narrow opening of the forest saw strange volumes of smoke rolling southward. Hotter, hotter, strongly and more steadily came the wind. He suddenly checked his horse, and listening, grew pale at the sound which reached him. It was a low deep roar, as of a wind in the tree-trops, or of a waterfall, distant, and smothered in a deep ravine. ' God have mercy ! ' he exclaimed : ' a bush fire I and in this thick forest ! ' Once more he sprang forward, shouting, thundering with his whip. He and the herd were galloping along the narrow wood track. But, as he had turned west ward in tho direction of his home, the woods � of which he had before seen the boundary � now closed for some miles upon him ; and, as he could not turn right or left for the chaos of vines and scrub that obstructed the forest, the idea of being overtaken there by tho bnsh-fire was horrible. Such an event would be death, and death only. Therefore lie urged 011 his flying herd with des peration. Crack upon crack from his long whip resounded through the hollow wood. |The cattle themselves seemed to hear the ominous sound, and sniff the now strongly perceptible smell of burning. The roar of the fire came louder, and ever and anon seemed to swell and surge as if urged on by a rough rising blast. The heat was fierce and suffocating. The young squatter's clothes clung to liiin with streaming perspiration. The horse and cattle steamed and smoked with boiling heat. Yet onward, onward they dashed with lolling tongues. Sorcerer, specked with patches of foam 011 his dark shining body, seemed to grow furiously impatient of the obstruction offered by the bullocks in his path. As his mas ter's whip exploded 011 their flanks, he laid back his ears ; and with flaming eyeballs . and bared teeth, strove to tear them in his rage. Robert Patterson knew that the extraordinary heat and drought of the summer had scorched up the grass � the very ground ; had licked up the water from crab-hole, pool, and many a creek ; had withered the herbage into crisp hay, and so withered the foliage that yon might crumble it be tween your fingers. The country seemed thoroughly prepared for a conflagration, and only required this fiery wind to send a blaze of extermination over the whole land. For weeks, nay months, the shepherds and sawyers had spoken of fires burning in the hills ; and in the fern-tree breaks of this very forest he had been recently told that flames had been observed in various directions burning redly by night. If the fire had reached him and his herd before they escaped into the open plains, they must he consumed like stubble. The cattle began to show signs of exhaustion, hanging out their parched tongues, and panting heavily ; the perspiration 011 himself and horse was dried up by the awful heat, and the dogs ran silently, or only whining lowly 

 to themselves, as they hunted every hollow on their way for water. Suddenly they were out in an open plain, yet with the forest on either hand, but at a considerable distance. What a scene ! The woods were flaming and crackling in one illimitable conflagration. Tlier wind, dashi�g from the north in gusts of incon ceivable heat, seemed to sere the very fa'ce, and shrivel up the lungs. The fire leaped from tree to tree, flashing and roaring along with the speeil and the destructiveness of lightning. Ihe^ sere foliage seemed to snatch the fire, and to perish in it in a riot of demonical revelry. On it flew, fast as the fleetest horse could gallop ; and consuming acres of leaves in a moment, still remained to rage and roar amongst the branches and in the hollow stems of ancient trees. The whole wood 011 the left was an enormous region of intensest flame ; and that on the right sent forth the sounds of the same ravaging fires ; but being to windward, the flames could not be seen for the vast clouds cf smoke, mingled with fiery sparks, which were rolled on the air. There was a sound as ot thunder, mingled with the crash of falling trees, and the wild cries of legions of birds of all kinds, which fell scorched and blackened and dead to the ground. Once out on this open plain the cattle wore speedily lost in the blinding ocean of smoke, and the young settler obliged to abandon them, made a dash onward for his life. Now the flames came racing along the grass with the speed of the wind, and mowing all smooth as a pavement ; now it tore furiously through some near point of the forest, and flung burning ashes and tangles of blazing bark upon the galloping rider. But Sorcerer, with an instinct more infallible than human sagacity, sped on, over thicket, and stone, and fallen tree, snorting in the thick masses of smoke, and stretching forward his gaping jaws as to catch every breath of air to sustain impeded respiration. When the wind veered, the reek driven back ward, revealed a most amazing scene. The blazing skirts of the forests ; huge isolated trees, glaring red � standing columns of fire : here avast troop of wild horses with flying manes and tails, rushing with thundering hoofs over the plain ; there herds of cattle running with bloodshot eyes and hanging tougues they know not wither, from the fires ; troops of kangaroos leaping frantically across the rider's path, their hair singed and giving out strongly the stench of fire ; birds of all kinds and colors shrieking piteously as they drove wildly by, and yet saw no spot of safety ; thousands of sheep standing huddled in terror on the scorched flats, with singed wool, deserted by their shepherds, who had fled for their lives. But onward flew the intrepid Sorcerer, onward stretched his rider, thinking lightning-winged thoughts of home, and of his helpless, paralysed mother there. With a caution inspired by former outbreaks of bush-fires, he had made at some distance round his homestead a bare circle. He had felled the forest-trees, leaving only one here and there, at such distances that there was little fear of ignition. As the summer dried the grass, he had set fire to it on days when the wind was gentle enough to leave the flame at command ; watching, branch in hand, to beat out any blaze that might have travelled into the forest. By this means he had hitherto prevented the fire from reaching his homestead ; and he had strongly recommended the same plan to his neighbors, though generally with little effect, Now the fire was so terrible, and sparks flew so wide on the wind, thatlie feared they might kindle the grass round his homestead, and that he might find everything and every person the e consumed. But, behold ! the gleaming, welcome water of Lake Colac. Sorcerer rushed headlong towards it ; and wading hastily up to his sides in its cool ing flood, thrust his head to the eyes into it, and drank as if he could never be satisfied with less than the whole lake. Englishmen, new to the scene, would have trembled for the horse ; but the bush steed knows best what he needs, eats and drinks as likes him best( and flourishes on if. Smoking hot, the rider lets him drink his fillrand all goes well. The heat produces perspiration, and the evaporation cools and soothes him. Robert Patterson did not lose a moment in fol lowing Sorcarer's example. He flung himself headlong from the saddle, dressed as he- was, dived and splashed and drank exuberantly. He held again and again his smarting face' arul singed hands in the delicious water ; then threw it over the steed, that now, satiated, stood panting in the flood. He laved and rubbed down the grateful animal with Wave after wave, cleaning the dried perspiration from every hair, giving him refresh ment at every pore. Then up and away again. He had not ridden two hundred yards before he saw, lying on the plain, a horse that had fallen in saddle and bridle, and lay with his legs under him, and head stretched stiffly forward, with glaring eyeballs, but dead. Near him was a man, alive, but sunk in exhaustion. His eye3 turned wildly 011 the young sqiutter, and his parched lips moved, but without a sound. Robert Patterson compre hended his need, and, running to the lake, brought his pannikin full of water, and put it to his mouth. It was the water of life to him. His voice and some degree of strength come quickly back. He had come from the north, arul had ridden a race with the fire, till horse and man had dropped here, the horse never to rise again. But Patterson's need was too urgent for delay. He found the man had no lack of .provisions ; he carried him in his arms to the margin of the lake, mounted and rode on. As he galloped forward, it was still fire � fire everywhere. He felt convinced that the con flagration � fanned by the strong wind, and acting upon fires in a hundred quarters � extended over the whole sun-dried colony. It was still early noon, when, with straining eyes, and a heart which seemed almost to stand still with a terrible anxiety, he came near his own home. He darted over the brow of a hill � there it lay safe ! The circle within his clear boundary was untouched by the fire. There were his pad docks, his cattle, his huts, and home. With a lightning thought his thanks flew up to Heaven, and he was the next moment at his door, in his house, and in his mother's arms.
