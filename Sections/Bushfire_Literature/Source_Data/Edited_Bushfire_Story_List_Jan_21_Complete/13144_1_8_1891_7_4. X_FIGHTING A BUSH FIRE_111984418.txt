 PART IV.�A FREE BUSHMAN.   CHAPTER X. FIGHTING A BUSH FIRE. CHAPTER X.�FIGHTING A BUSH FIRE.     

 When at Gawler I determined to see Melbourne and the Port Phillip district. I started out, and first came to the Dust Holes. Crossing a wide plain, I arrived at a ferry on the Murray. I crossed, and travelled up the river to the end of the border line, near the junction of the Darling and the Murrav. From there I went on to 

 the Tatiara, through the great desert. Near this I saw what appeared to me a very large sheet of fresh water; but on coming   to it I found it to be an immense salt lake. There I fell in with a Government sur- veyor, a one-handed man, with whom I engaged. His work was to run the line through the mallee scrub, clearing it off for the width of one chain. I started with him the next morning. From the Murray there was a considerable extent of grazing ground up to a dense scrub of mallee, and through this scrub, looking ahead, appeared a long avenue or tunnel, as far as the eye could reach, formed of overhanging boughs. The thick undergrowth in this tunnel was what he had to clear. The salt water lake swarmed with pelicans and other water fowl. Our conveyance was a spring cart, with a tarpaulin covering. The next day we started to clear the Mallee scrub, along the boundary line, and at length came into another thick scrub of Ti-tree, which we also dug up, erecting long poles on heaps of sand shovelled up on one side of the clearing, about a quarter of a mile apart acting as sights and show- ing the line of road. Our next step was 

 to dig out a reservoir in the sand, and, spreading the large tarpaulin over the hole, trampled it down to make a watertight bank, fixing the sides by shovelling the sand on them to keep all in place. Thus we had a safe tank to catch and hold any rainfall. I worked thus for about a month,   meantime the supply of water brought with us in the cart from the Murray was becoming very nearly exhausted, no sign of rain, and about fifty miles to the nearest point of the river. We continued the line of poles all through the desert, but found that the dry weather had set in, and at last our water was done. For two days we were without a drop for man or beast. The surveyor proposed hiding all our rations and tools in the sand and returning to the river. Finding the party had thus resolved, I, wishing to make my way further into the Port Philip country, so informed them, and bought a horse from one of the men. When they had planted everything not then wanted, I took leave of them, and turned my face toward Port Phillip. The surveyor told me that if I intended to go by the Tatiara I should find holes or wells sunk for water along the route. Bidding them again farewell, I started off in a broiling hot sun, and for the want of water both myself and the 

 horse suffered fearfully. On the third day, without a drop, I came to the first camping place�a Ti-tree scrub, with a few large     trees here and there, and the long-looked for hole or well, the first on the Port Phillip side. With eager haste I made for the spot, and to my horror found it nearly filled up with sand, and not the slightest sign of water. Nothing daunted I tethered my jaded horse, and taking off all un- necessary clothing, got into the hole, and with hands and boots began shoveling out the sand as quickly as possible, my poor horse whinnying and pawing the ground all the while. Near the edge of the hole stood a large tree, a good portion of it   withered and dead. Being tired with my labor I halted for a space, and lay down, unable to eat a morsel, my mouth and throat being so parched. After a time I again tried hard to get some water, but all my efforts were in vain. I could not find even the sign of dampness. At night I had to knock off, and made a good fire. The night was very dark. I lay till about mid- night, as far as I could judge, when I awoke from my state of half stupor, and looking back towards the track I had ridden over during that day I saw a glare over the scrub, and shortly after a great flame of fire shoot upwards to the sky. I at once knew that the bush was on fire. The flames rapidly approached my camping ground. Being entirely ignorant of the extent of the scrub by which I was surrounded, I became fearful of being burnt alive. The mere idea of the dreadful danger in which I stood increased my sense of thirst tenfold, I led my horse 

 to the edge of the hole with the intention of killing him and skinning the carcase   to cover myself over in the dried up (or, rather, filled up) well with the hide. I first bled him as he stood by the hole, saving as much of the blood as I could. At length he fell, and I turned to skin him as quickly as possible, for I knew I would not have much time to spare before my dreaded foe would be upon me. Having finished the skinning with the exception   of the head I went into the hole, drawing the hide over it. I had knocked off one of the horse shoes with a piece of a rock, and with it commenced tunnelling in the side. and throwing the sand out with my hands, forcing myself under the bank. By this the flames, sweeping all before them, had reached the body of the horse, and from my place of shelter I could hear the flesh crackling and frizzling in the scorching heat, and could see the melted oil and fat trickling down the side, and quickly flowing towards me, while I squeezed myself into as small a bulk as I could to escape from it. When I thought the strength of the fire was dying away, I heard a tremendous 

 crash directly overhead, and guessed cor- rectly that the half dead tree near me had been burned through and had fallen across the hole, one flaming stake pinning the roasting carcase to the ground. The stench of the roasted horseflesh and of the oil and fat, now coming into the tunnel in a small stream, was almost suffocating and quite sickening. I had to dam the latter back with sand scooped out of my tunnel with my hands and horseshoe. Frightened to move my hide covering I remained there till, I think, broad day- light. When the seething carcase emitting no further sounds, I ventured to look out, and raising one corner of the covering I was nearly smothered with bucketfuls of hot ashes and charcoal, which had lodged on it from the burning tree, and which drop- ing into the melted fat and oil mixed with sand, raised such an abominable smoke and smell that, had there been a roaring furnace before me, I must have faced it or have been stifled or scalded to death in my den. On emerging I found the grass around burnt to the roots and the hollow limbs of the trees belching forth smoke and flame. In iny haste to escape into the hole, I had left my boots or drinking cups on top, and on looking round all I could find of them was the iron tips and the scorched leather curled up over the 

 toes. So with the saddle, nothing remained but the gullet-plate, backplate, bars, stirrups, and other ironwork, and of the bridle, the bit and buckles. My jacket and all rations were entirely consumed, as I had no room in the hole for them while at work; and, as I had in the bustle of   leaving my mates forgotten to bring with me a billycan, even had I found water, I had no means of fetching it. I thought to myself, "Was ever man in a more miser-   able plight?" Now came the question of   how to protect my feet, as the smoking stumps of the burnt-down Ti-tree smoul- dered all around, with scarcely room be- tween them whereon to step. Luckily I found the knife (a two-bladed one, horn- handled) I had used in skinning where I had left it beside the carcass. The horn part was curled up in rings, but the ironwork and blades safe. I pulled up the portion of hide over the hole, which was yet un- burned, and from it cut strips for lacings, and with another portion formed a pair of rough sandals, lacing them to my feet and ankles, and thus shod I thought I might manage for a time, the only thing affecting   me being in the tread or bend of the foot�   stiff and hard. I moistened my lips and mouth with a few drops of what still remained in the toe of one of my boots, loathsome as it was. I then cut off a breadth of the skin, about three and a half feet long, scraped and cleaned it, intend- ing to use it in replacing my sandals when worn out. I then turned my atten- tion to the roasted body of my poor four footed companion, and found that part of the rump not immediately attacked by the 

 flames was cooked to a turn. I cut several   pieces from it, and finding a nice, juicy bit, about a pound or more, I greedily devoured it, and truly enjoyed it, feeling very much refreshed. The other I wrapped up in the skin, fastening it with the unused strips of lacing. Looking now for the path or track I had to pursue, I could find not the slight- est trace of it, all being alike; while ahead   in the direction of my route was one mass of roaring, hissing, spluttering flame. At last I fancied I saw an opening in the forest, the place near where I was seeming to be a belt of timber about a mile wide. In this direction I headed, and on the edge discerned what seemed to me remarkably like the moles or heaps of sand into which we had stuck the poles in clearing, though, of course, there was now no sign of stick or pole. On looking closer there appeared to be a line of them. I followed on this line, gingerly picking my steps among the smoking stumps of Ti-tree and salt bush. I walked on all day, parched almost beyond endurance, a blazing sun beaming upon me the while, whilst with my fingers I scraped the half-baked phlegm from my blistered mouth. Towards night the heat of the sun and sand, had so hardened the hide on my feet and ankles that they became badly chafed and bled freely. Having the large piece   in which I had wrapped my horseflesh I cut with my knife pieces shaped like the legs of trousers, tied one end with strips of hide, and drawing the other part over this formed a rough sort of boot or mocassin and laced up the edges with the thin strips, thus, affording protection to my feet and   legs nearly to the knee. That night I placed them on my feet to get them some- thing into form, and lay with open mouth on the chance of gaining a little moisture from the night air, at times dropping off into a state of semi-forgetfulness, and   again starting up as from a horrible dream. Thus I passed a considerable portion of the night. At length, with a feeling that my senses were leaving me, I resolved to walk 

 it off, and eating a small portion of the flesh I had by me, I followed on the track marked by the sand heaps. All that morn- ing I so continued, but about noon the rays of the sun quite overpowered me. Not a tree or a shelter of any sort to be seen�   nothing but the stunted and scorched salt bush all round, through which the fire now slowly crept, and by the intense heat add- ing further to my already almost unbear- able sufferings. Again my mind wandered, but I still pushed on. The track now be- came plainer, and occasionally a pole could be seen standing in the heap where the fire had passed it by. During the after- noon I fancied I would be better without any shirt�a mad idea�so taking it off I   tore out the sleeves and made a sort of nightcap to shield my head, till now unprotected, my hat having been lost with all other things the day before at the dry well. Another misfortune, now befell me. My trousers began to chafe, and off they went, and in my dazed state I reck- lessly cast them away, leaving myself naked, barring my leggings and nightcap. Semi-conscious and in a perfect haze I     strode onwards, my only desire being water�water. (TO BE CONTINUED.)
