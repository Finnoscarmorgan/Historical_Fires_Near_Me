 BY M. FORREST. 

 The firelight glimmered on the fallen leaves and played hide-and-seek among the slender grey trunks of the? gum trees. From near the road could be heard the occasional clink of a hobble-chain, where the horses were feed ing. The short man lay on his back, and stared up at the stars which peeped through the overhanging branches. 

 The tall man was watching his companion's face and the red glow of his pipe amid the shadows. Presently the fire leaped into flame, and he said sharply, 'Ever been this way before?' The oilier, who was inclined to be communi cative, laughed and lay back luxuriously on his blanket. 'Once, years ago, I lived here,' he said. 'I am glad I fell in with you � it's nice to pick up a mate to yarn to. I must say I soon get enough of my own company. Do you be long to these parts?' Tli� tall man hesitated perceptibly before he answered in a non-committal fashion. 'I have been droving these ten years out the Gulf way.' The short man, who apparently had been drinking, looked dreamily at the stars again, not noticing the evasive reply. 'Yes; I belonged here once,' he repeated ruminatively. 'and I'll tell you why I cleared out,' confidentially. 'It was over a woman � a selector's daughter. I didn't want to marry her, and there was another chap after her. So the day before the wedding I just cut and ran. I transferred my selection on the Q.T. to one of the Alexanders. I daresay you have heard of them � two brothers, who used to be about here. I just got clean away. Changed my name, and left no address. Have been in America these 15 years, and have done well. Come out here again on business, and thought I would like to have a look again at the old place. I expect Bessie married that red-headed Alec, in the end, but I never bothered my head to look' at the papers. I've a wife and kids in Iowa.' He paused, and put his hand under his blanket for bis flask of rum. 'Have a drink?' The tall man shook his head, leaning for ward elbow on knee. 'No; Bessie didn't marry Alec Alexander,' he said, very softly. 'You see, when you didn't turn up, Alec, was ar rested for your murder. There was some thing informal about the transfer 'of that selection, and he was the last man you were seen with.' The short man sat up suddenly, and nearly dropped the flask-. 'What!' he cried, his blue eyes round with astonishment. 'Why, I never thought of that!' Then he began to laugh. 'Poor, old, thick-head Alec. What a stew he must have been in. How did he get out of it?'- I Tlie tall' man emptied the ashes of his pipe into the fire, and drew himself a little nearer to the stout figure on the blanket. 'He didn't get out of it,' .he said,- sharply, 'they hanged him on circumstantial evidence. Ther? had been a lot of bush .fires about, and some suspicious-looking bones were found on the selection. It was known that he and the missing man were on bad terms over a girl, and that Alexander wanted the property. You know ihe police!' There was silence, save for the sough of the wind among the trees, and Ihe hurried breathing of the stout man as he choked over another swallow of rum. He clutched the half-empty flask to his breast, and Bhiftel his feet uneasily. The tall man stood up, and kicked a smoking log further back oh to the fire. His right hand was on his hip, and his eyes� fierce and black as a basilisk were on his companion. 'You needn't have crawled off the way you did, Sadler,' he said. The little man felt the rum mounting to his head. 'What's that to you anyways? ?Who are you, I'd like to know?' ? The tall man leaned over him, and the other looked suddenly down the barrel of a revolver. 'I am Dave Alexander,' he answered, shortly. '' 'You didn't know me this after noon, but I dropped on to you at once. That's .why I'suggested camping together to-night.' Some wallaby which the - horses had dis turbed dashed past the camp, and the howl of a dingo came from the sheep paddocks to tlie right. Pat Sadler saw Death very near to him, and drew his breath sharply. He tried to speak, but only .gibbered silently. Above, the golden stars gleamed in a sweep of cloudless sky. The scent of dropping san dal-wood flowers floated from the : lossom ing trees on the- river flats. Tlie fire- leapt redly up, and died into glowing coal and snow white ash. Dave was -thinking of Bessie, and of liis brother, the large-framed Australian jy-ith the honest eyes' and' laughing, sun-burnt face, the strong living muscles on back and shoul der. Then he remembered how hanged men looked. Shooting was too good for this crea ture squirming in front of him. How plad he would have been if someone h I shot Alec cleanly and surely in lair fight, be fore he came to the rope, and broke his mother's heart. Blind Justice! . Was there ? God up there beyond the stars, seated so 

 high that he could not see /how men mishan dled the God-given laws? No; he would not shoot. He lowered his revolver. 'Get up,' he said, tersely, _ 'Catch your horse and clear out before: I brain you. Shooting's top good for you. If 1 leave you alone, you'll come to the gallows. Besides, you'll take Hell with you after to-night. There's Bessie to walk by you in the dark, and a hanged man's face to gape at you by day. Clear, I say, or � ' . The. short jnan, stumbling and swearing, ran towards the .clink of the hobble chains. Pre sently he sneaked back for his saddle aud pack. 'You promised not to shoot,' he sobbed, . dodging behind a thick-boled ironbark. The tall man laughed. 'I promised,' lie ?said. 'Did you ever keep a promise, Pat Sadler?' He heard the short man's fingers fumbling furiously at strap and buckle, and then the thunder of hoofs on the road leading back to the township. 'He won't trouble these parts again,' re marked Dave, reflectively, as he unrolled his blanket for the night. He slipped the cart ridge out of his revoler, and added � 'When I put that in there to-day I meant to take it out empty.' He heaped some more wood upon the fire, for a chilly breath from the river was making itself felt. And as he rolled himself in his blanket, he asked himself the question, 'I wonder why I let him go scot free after all?' But, even as he asked, he knew the an swer. For, truly, as Pat Sadler went flying tremb ling and blaspheming through the cooU sweet night, his own particular Hell went with him.
