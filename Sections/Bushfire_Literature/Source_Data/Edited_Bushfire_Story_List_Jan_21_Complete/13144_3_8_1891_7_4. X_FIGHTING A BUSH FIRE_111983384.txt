 PART IV.�A FREE BUSHMAN.   CHAPTER X. FIGHTING A BUSH FIRE. CHAPTER X.�(CONTINUED.)   

 Looking ahead and straining my eye- sight to the utmost in search of some indi- cation of it I saw a bird at a long distance, seemingly approaching me in a straight line, and knowing there were none in the desert I felt certain that I must be near 

 its edge. My spirits somewhat revived, and as it came nearer, I could see from its flight it was a pigeon. Already in anti- cipation I had him, I plucked him, and un- cleaned and uncooked I was ready to devour him. The thought ran through me: "What a Divine interposition! Here   I am alone and naked in a broiling sun, without shade or shelter, almost perishing, body and mind, from want of water to cool my parched up throat, when Heaven intervenes, and sends me this stray bird to supply my most pressing want." I felt certain it was sent to save my life. I actually went to meet it, holding out my hand to take hold of it, when to my surprise and joy, within a few feet of me, it dropped like a thunderbolt into a salt bush. I sprang forward, and I in- stantly seized it and saw that in its fall it had got entangled by the wings in a vine loaded with small berries entwining the bush. I have since thought   that the sight of these berries was what made it suddenly pitch. However, I lost no time in securing it, wringing its neck, plucking it, I dare say not over nicely, and in less time than it takes to tell it disappeared, to the   infinite relief of my thirst in body and mind. I pushed on and found I was ap- proaching the desert's edge. Further on, and at some distance, I espied a smoke, curling straight upwards, differ- ing from the smoke of the bush fires. This was on the rise of a hill, away from the track I was on, and appeared to me as if from a blackfellow's fire. I went toward it and found it to be as I had thought, a   blacks' encampment, and a large one, too. I was very soon sighted, the alarm was given, and instantly all eyes were directed on me, like those of a mob of sheep sud- denly rounded up. They at once seized their spears and boomerangs, the former ready-fixed in the wommeras, or throwing sticks, for hurling at me if the devil seized them. However, knowing their customs, I went boldly forward, when one of them shouted, "Were lim barqee?"�that is,     "Where are you from?" I answered at the     top of my voice, though not very loud under my present condition, "Borak me menaree"   �"I don't know where." They then sur-     rounded me, staring with all their eyes at a white man dressed in Nature's garb. After a while one of the gins advanced, looked earnestly at me, eyeing me all over, and seeing my breast covered with tattoo marks, exclaimed, "Me menaree you." (I   know you). "You quambee (or stop)   along McGrath's flat." How she came to recognise me was from my habit of bogey- ing (bathing) along with the blacks in the Corong while riding the Mount Gambier mail. Having been thus peacefully re- ceived, my first cry was for water, with which I was supplied, having sense enough not to drink too much at once. I then asked them, "You got it cudgella?" (food).     She spoke to the men, who produced some young ducks, caught in a swamp not far off. Some of these they cooked, while the gin who had identified me brought me a 'possum cloak, a very acceptable offering in my then condition, and for which I was most grateful. After a good blowout I felt very comfortable. They made up a good fire, by which wrapped in my warm and soft cloak I lay down, and was soon sound asleep; nor did I awake till late next   morning. For breakfast I had another small duck, and the leg of a 'possum, and well satisfied I was. My friend the gin and another then took me to a station situated on the track running between the Tatiara, at one end, and Border Town, on the Murray, at the other end�(the same     line I was pursuing when overtaken by the fire). It proved to be a dairy station, occupied by (I think) a Scotch family, there being sons and daughters all grown up. From one of the former I soon obtained a com- plete suit of clothes, which suited me to a "T," the overseer being of stalwart form   like myself. I returned the cloak to my   dusky guide, who at once decamped, car- rying with her a goodly swag of tucker.     CHAPTER XI.�POSING AS A NEW CHUM   I then related my late adventure to the head of the family, who instructed one of the sons to return on the way I had come, and to look out for the trousers I had thrown away in my wandering moments, and which contained all my money in sovereigns and a few shillings. Saddling up, and taking some little rations with him, as I could not tell him where I had stripped off my nether garments, and he might be some time in finding them, he went off in search. I meantime made my-   self at home with the other members of the family. About 10 p.m. he returned bring- ing with him my trousers and the remains     of the shirt, saying, "Here's the little bag   you had in your pocket, but I could find no knife." I emptied the bag on the table and   displayed 31 sovereigns and 11s in silver. The girls got hold of the shirt, and the sleeves I had made into a hat, saying they would put them in again, wash and iron it, and it would be as useful as ever, which they did. This incident of the gin and her companions shows that the aborigines even at that time were not so black as they have been painted by some. 

 The hospitality of this Scotch, family is but on a par with that of many of the same class in the colony, notwithstanding the slurs that have been thrown out against the Australian natives of like standing, as being devoid of the leading principles of humanity, and of being full of selfishness. I have often heard it asserted that the bulk of this class are no better than idlers and horse-stealers, earning their living in the easiest, though   most precarious manner they could. This, from my own many experiences, I am in a position most flatly to contradict.   I remained one day more with this kind family, and thoroughly rested myself. Then I dressed up in my new rig, and surveying myself in the glass I came to the conclusion that I looked a regular Methodist parson in my black cloth coat, something swallow-tail fashion, and a white handkerchief (from one of the girls) tied round my throat. Such I was actually taken for on a future occasion. In addition I now donned a black silk hat, which I had picked up in the cow-house, it having served many purposes, among them that of a hatching box for some one of the fowls.   However, after a good deal of scraping, brushing, and other titivations I got it to assume a somewhat decent appearance, which suited admirably the rest of my rig out. Thus equipped I went on my way, and shortly arrived at a police station and a public-house, in the direction of the scene of my former exploits (Mount Gambier).   There I remained that night. I think the place was named Mosquito Plains, in the Tatiara country. Next morning I headed off, intending to take the route for Gee- long. Walking all day, towards night I came to a public-house, called the Border Inn, no the road between Mount Gambier and the Glenelg, where I put up, and next day reached Hassal's Station, the owner of which has now considerable interest in the Bathurst district, in New South Wales. This was a large horse-breeding station, and here I applied for work. My appear- ance created a great deal of mirth, and I was assailed by such questions as�   "How long have you been in the country?"   "What ship brought you?" and such like,     they little dreaming of the character ad- dressed. One of my questioners in a jocular humor clapped his hand on my silk hat, and sent it crushing over my eyes, all of which with their chaff I took in good part, still keeping up the idea that I was a late arrival, a new chum. When asked what ship I came in, knowing the name of a vessel lately arrived at Port Adelaide, I gave it. Presently the over- seer asked me if I could ride, as they were in want of a stockrider. I told him I had been very well accustomed to ride donkeys in the old country, and after them I thought I could manage anything, never hinting of my horsebreaking experiences when mail rider. They had been muster- ing horses at this station when I appeared, and the overseer said he would get me a horse, and I should yard the others stand- ing outside the yards. Meantime he sent a couple of hands to drive them a little further off. Mounted, supplied with spurs, but quite ignorant of stockriding, though I was as firm as a rock on horseback, I managed happily to yard all the horses but one. This one a child could drive to the yard, but once at the slip rails no further; he would at once break away and   be off at full tear. Determined not to be bested, I followed in pursuit, and as I came up to him, he turned as on a pivot, but the old stock horse I was on was as quick as he, and rather quick for me, and to my discomfiture, suddenly propping and wheeling after the runaway, pitched me headlong from the saddle, when I verily believed my neck was broken. My nag continued after the other just as if he had the most skilful stockman on his back. Recovering quickly from the shock I looked round, and saw my lost horse quietly standing at the yard entrance, having, unaided by hands, run the other   inside. I then made for the huts, where the men stood in roars of laughter at the   odd sight I presented. My unfortunate hat, which I had put to rights after the rough treatment it had received when I first showed up, had now come to bitter grief, the crown having been entirely cut out by my fall, and hanging over the side.   I explained that if the brute had gone straight I would still have been there, which increased their merriment, and, be- coming rather nettled, I offered to bet a sovereign I could ride any horse that any one of them could. My offer was accepted, one man laying me two pounds to one I would not ride the same horse he did. He handed me a cheque, and I agreed, stipulating that the horse should be held till I got seated, when I would put up with the conse- quences, win or lose. The bet was made, a horse caught and brought up. He proved to be a well-known thorough buckjumper. However, he was mounted by his owner, and although I have seen many more treacherous in that line, this one could play up some. He was no sidejumper, however, his worst trick, as I saw, being   to catch the rider by the leg if he he could, and as I afterwards learned, if he succeeded in thus dismounting him, would try worry him like a dog. His owner know- ing he would not stand the spur, made it one of the conditions that I should wear these appendages, thinking that I would be sticking my heels into his ribs or flanks, and thus ensure my downfall. But I had looked carefully on while he was showing off, as he no doubt thought to my amaze- ment and terror, when in an unguarded moment, his attention being withdrawn from the animal under him, the opportu- nity was seized, and with one terrific bound the rider was shot like an arrow from his seat, and measured his length on the ground, thus ending the first part of the performance. Now came my part. I was told to try my hand; but instead of plac- ing the spurs on my heels, I fastened them in front over the instep, saying that any- where would do, but in any own mind thinking that, if he took a fancy to my leg, I would make his nose and my spur acquainted.
