 They stepped -within the shadows for fear of recognition ; through the soft empyreal skies the silver moon cast- her bright influence over the tranquil scene. A calm west wind swept through the wood, softly breathing through the ^fallen leaves, ?while the slanting moonlight rays fell upon the clandestine couple 'below. Mrs. Fane . was fair, very fair to look at ; there was something of the Gretchen in her looks. But she was a Gretchen of the modern date, a Gretchen of fashion and society who laid stress upon silks and satin, gloves and boots, rings and bangles, frills and furbelows of the latest mode. Stooping down, Sir Francis looked into her eyes � a look so longing so incredulous, so straining with hope and fear, as a man might give into the depths of fathomless waters, in whose light he seeks some long lost jewel. ' Is it true ?' As his voice quivered on these words as he read ' the truth, he was no longer tortured by doubt as he gazed down on her face ; JKe drew her in Vii� arms, gave her one caress' with breath less kisses on her lips and brow ; he forgot all danger, he forgot that such a person as John Fane existed, he forgot everything save that he loved this woman. Isba for an instant made no resistance, but let herself lie in the arms that held her so well,, and let her head rest upon Tn� shoulder. This trance of sweet f orgetfulness, this momentary banishment of everything, she gave herself up to. For a short space she felt no thing but the voluptuous abandonment of emotion. 

 Why is it so many women sacrifice the peace and honor of their days on dissi pation's altar ? Why will they offer up the quiet of their life, with all a husband's fond endearing 'love, at pleasure's, shrine? Ah! thoughtless, daughters ,��- intoxicating pleasure, why;/ .will-, you run -bo -.near the depths of darir destruction, nor once .re member, in the wild delirium of each gay pursuit, that the heart once lost by indis cretion is rarely or ever to be regained ? Women may be considered like fruit. Those that fall to the ground of their own accord are generally tainted and good for nothing ; but those that will not fall without a good deal of shaking are sound and worth having. ' Isba, my darling,' said Six Francis, 'I want to talk, rvery seriously to you. . The crisis has come 'in 'our livesj, aS$.-I am to find out to-night whether -yojr are- the true woman I believe you tb be, or only the pretty foreign coquette, who has fooled me to the top of my bent and who can whistle me off and let me down the wind to prey at fortune as soon as I became a nuisance. Isba, sweetheart, I want you to answer a serious question to-night, and all the happi ness of my future life depends upon your answer.' She looked up at him, with her hand still clasping his. The link must soon be broken for ever. - Only for a little ' whil$ longer might she] retain that dear hand in hers. The pain of the thought was strangely mingled -with the joy of being with ViiTn- of hearing from -�i� lips that she -was beloved.; What did she care for Faversham gossipgj?� ^ 

 or tor the Husband who Had.- bestowed on her all his love, wealth, and care for the. past sis years? They were nothing now while her lover was beside her. 'Isba,' said Sir Francis very gravely, bending his head to a level with hers as he spoke, but looking at the ground rather than at her, ' it is time we ended this farce of duty and submission to the -world ; . we have tried to rule out lives by the laws that other people have made for us. But we cannot � we cannot, my darling. We are hypocrites, who try to mask our Tevolt under the pretence of submission. 'When T^e meet you aie. happy-r-unuttej&bly happy. But~when you leave me, you go home to your husband, you smile at Mm, hoodwink and fool him, and act a perpetual lie for Mb delusion $ you are not happy .nor content. Isba ih\\a must cease. You cannot serve two masters, you -cannot go on living the life' you have led for the past year, it is impossible^ sweetheart. I love you, Isba, I want you to make an end of your present life, and leave this place for ever. I have made a hundred plans for our life, sweet heart. There is not a whim or fancy of yours that I have not remembered. I fancy you with me, Isba, and, behold, my life is transformed. Mine is no light love that time or custom can change or lessen; if it were, I would have done my duty and Btayed away from you. I have thought of your happiness, my darling, and ask you now to trust me, and leave this place for ever.' ? . . She was silent i for & moment. -;She was powerless to tafefaer him,' so sudden -was his proposal to lier ; ' she loved him'dearly, but she had sever thought it would come to this. ' I go to-morrow, sweetheart. 1 enonld have gone to-day, but I wanted your answer. It is better I fVa'^ be away for a' little while.' - She looked at him with, eyes still drowned in. 'tears ; but radiant with the truth of Her sentimental soul, which had never before jevealed itself so artlessly, as-sowt - **? .- . ?-. .. ? ' - ' . ' 

 *' Will you not give me an answer, Isba ?' he pleaded. ' ' I will do as you- wish, Francis, for I love you dearly, very dearly ; but not yet � in two or three months' time.' 'At once, sweetheart,'- he answered; 'I will take care of you, I know all, the reason you will not go at 'once; but I will take care no harm comes to you.*' ' But if John should catch me, he will kill me, I know he wilL' Whether it was the strain of the moment, or her fear of her husband, she leant against the tree by which she stood, sobbing bitterly, with her face hidden in her hands. ' Isba, for heaven's sake, listen to me ! Can you doubt my love � the truth, the honesty of my intentions .? Whatever the truest husband can be to his wife, I swear to be to you. ? You have only to trust me, sweetheart.' . . . 'Oh, Francis, I love, I will, I will trust you ; I will write you ; I will send you word when I shall be ready ; but give me a little time to think.' ' You shall have as much time as you like, sweetheart ; you shall write me to Paris, you know my address,' he answered soothingly. -' Francis,' she said, after a pause, ' it is getting late, and I shall be missed ; I must go. Good-bye, some day we shall meet again.' ' Good-bye, sweetheart ; I trust that day will not be a long way off. Isba, dearest, remember your promise.' rtT will, Francis.' And so they, parted. Unhappily for Isba Fane there was one who came quietly along by the 'close walk,' enjoying his after dinner cigar, who saw the lingering meeting, the fond embrace, the fervent kiss, but could not hear the words that went with them,�-r see the face of the ttihti. He was evidently waiting for someone, and had wandered thus far with listless gait and a mind preter naturally busy. Above him the lights of many of the windows of the old hall shone out, while other windows remained dark and shadowy. By the frown upon hia face as he glanced around one might gather that his thoughts were not agreeable. John Fane, for it was he, saw the couple, but taking no heed, aftid ;thinking it was only a couple of his retainers having a quiet evening flirta tion, he was about to pass on, when the voice of the woman attracted his attention, and he stayed for one moment ; the voice, the accent, was so like that of hfa wife's. In the heart of man there is a perpetual suc cession of passions, so that the destruction of one is almost always the production of another. John Fane had loved his -wife with all the passion of his ardent nature ; but now, by a doubt as to the constancy of his wife's fidelity, jealousy had been nourished, and his heart, -while still agitated by his love for her, had become susceptible of jealousy. Isba Fane walked quickly back to the east wing by the garden, so that if she met her husband, she would have the excuse of her being1 out for a stroll, she not feeling 

 welL Just as she -was turning a bend in the pathway, suddenly there broke upon that autumn stillness a loud rustling of boughs, and a man sprang from their midst and confronted her. She looked up full of sudden fear. Turning round, and being accustomed to the faint light, she distin guished a tall dark form. Fascinated and terror-struck^ she gazed, not with ghostly fear, but with a fear far more real. Far too well did she discern the outlines of that form, and knew it to be no other than that of her husband. John Fane strode forward, Viis eyes glar ing, his white features terribly livid in the moonlight. ' Oh, John ! How you frightened me,' she gasped. ;.' ' No doubt 5 women who meet - their lovers in secret are -easily startled. Go to your room.' She dursjfc not disobey him at that moment, so she quietly, without a murmur did as she was bid. John Fane fol lowed closely, and closed the door. ' What does this mean, Isba?' ' I -was taking a walk in the shrubbery ,' she answered with an indifferent air, ' and ? But,' she broke off in anger, ' how dare you Bay I go to meet my lovers ?' ' Isba, you cannot deceive me ; I know it was no accidental meeting 5 whom were you speaking to ?' ' I refuse to answer you. I tell you I did not go to meet my lover, as you assert, and you refuse to believe me.' ' How dare you^ lie to me like that, I saw you. I saw 'him holding you in his arms, clasping you- to his breast, as I held you that accursed night when I thought myself the happiest among men, because I had won you for my own. Woman, have you no regard for your name ? My God ! to think she whom I trusted had come to this.' He turned away for fear his temper should get the better of him, and he should say too much. She crept slowly up to him, as she began to feel slightly sorry for what she had done. ' John ! John ! do not. I will be faithful to you, forgive me this once, John, I will tell you all,' she pleaded. He looked at her one moment, then turn ing Tound -he said: *' Do not touch' me, away with you, let me not see your fair face,' he Gried out angrily. His, arm was raised to strike, but she fell on it, and caught it, thus by a happv chance escaped the degrading blow, and saved her husband the shame. -�How can I believe what you tell me would be. the truth,' he continnued, a little less roughly. ? What could she.: say, how could she ? venture to ask -i.er Irasband's for giveness P She wanted- for the present to avoid a scandal, more .especially, as there were still some of her guests remaining. She knew John loved his daughter, she -would ask forgiveness that way j anything was better: than a scandal. ** John, -for the sake of the child I bore you, forgive me. Let. no scandal happen. Forgive me fri'' once,''.8he pleaded. - -- ' Your speech is fair,, fair, like your face. You do not want my forgiveness ; you only want to avoid a scandaL Do you think you are able .to deceive me without being per ceived? No, madam, I am not so easily deceived.' : � John, John, hear me, I will ? ' . � Go far out of my reach, lest I should do you some injury. Go, go V - wi-wai^feb/' sheTejplied^hapgh'&y; 'but -you shall live to regret: this day, John. Fane. I will go and leave your house,' she said ?with determination. .. � IVfofipTTij that you dare not do. Stay !' ie -cried, as ahe was slowly moving away. 

 'I have something else to say to you;', Isba,' do you hear me ? Stay ! -when I tell .you.' She heeded bi-m not, but swept from the room with, her head well up, heedless to his caTL He had refused to listen to her, and she in her turn, refused to listen to him. ** I will make you obey me, my lady,' he said with much -anger as. he followed her. ' You shall pay for this.' . In the corridor he met Deborah, and, turn ing sharply on her, he said, ' Go to your mistress j she will sleep in the chintz room for a short time. See that she is made com fortable,' and then he passed quickly on. (to be continued.)
