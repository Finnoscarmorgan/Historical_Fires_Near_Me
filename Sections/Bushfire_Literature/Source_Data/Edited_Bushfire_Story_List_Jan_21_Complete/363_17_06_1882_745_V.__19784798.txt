 CHAPTER V. 

 BY ONYX. 

 ORMOND was very loth to say good-bye to Ismene; but he too followed the dictates of worldly prudence, just as his proposed father-in-Law had done, and went, feeling that it was 

 to his own interest that no more of the valuable �heep should be sacrificed for want of the guidance of his knowledge and care, of both of which �especially the former�he had no mean estimation. " The world rates us as we rate ourselves," said Orraond, with his head, which was always carried very erect, more erect than ever, when Mr. Ourney good-humouredly ban tered him on the subject. "Right you are, Ormond," said the Rev. Ambrose, drawing a low sigh. "Quiteright�always right, / think, Ronald," said Ismene softly, slipping her arm through bis, and just letting her head touch against his shoulder. It was scarcely wonderful that Ronald's previous opinion of his own great ex* cellence should be increased by such testimony as that; and you may be sure it was. He had no aspirations after the status of the modest young man. " I won't be long, Ismene; and you know it is better for both our sakes. My little wife ?hall be a rich woman yet," Ormond said, as they were going through and prolonging the sweet pain of parting. " I don't want to be rich, Ronald; whatever I share with you will be riches to me," was the womanly reply. " Ay; but it would not be to me, Ismene. I want real tangible riches�none of the fabled stuff that turns to withered leaves; and sentiment belongs a little to that Btyle of thing, you know, darling"�and he gave an extra caress to nullify the rather unloverlike sentiment; under the influence of which Ismene's face, clouded for a minute at his "horrid" sentiments, brightened and beamed radiantly. "Though I am to owe my start in life to your money. Ismene, it shall be my own hard work that shall make the start the high road to fortune" �and Ronald's head went up again; he seemed as if he wanted to look the whole world defiantly in the face, and dare it ever to say he owed his fortune to his wife. Ismene did not attempt to soothe the pride that was so very ready to be ruffled. In fact her own gentle spirit scarcely comprehended the possibility of such a wound. She did not try to convince him of her little desire for riches, or her great indifference to the welfare of the valuable sheep. She did not tell him how much she would have preferred that he should have remained at the head station, where he could frequently come over to see her, nor did she try to persuade him to neglect his duty. She only clung a little closer to him, and stroked the hand she held. Ismene was yielding�too yielding�to those she loved. It was impossible for her to disagree with them, or even to express an antagonistic desire. She only murmured to herself, and kept her repining to her own gentle bosom. A pity�a great pity! If she had been decided and out spoken about this shrinking to let her lover go from her, perhaps Ronald would have stayed, for, though he was not a man lightly to be per suaded, he loved her very clearly then, and ncr wishes would have had great weight. " Suppose a flood should come while you are away, she said, after a little pause. "I wish to heaven it would!" was the very unsympathetic reply. "It will take nothing less than a flood to fill the watercourses. The ground is scorched up; it might rain for a week, and not a drop would he; the earth is like an empty sponge�it is so thirsty. It could absorb a reasonable flood and never look the fuller for it. It is awfully thirsty. By Jove, I think I can understand now what Milton meant about' the thirsty earth.'" Ismone had been looking up in her lover's face with a look of amusement and astonish ment very comical to see, and now she fairly burst out laughing. "What, you poetical, Ronald, quoting Milton ! and all in such a funny mixed medley kind of way. I don't know whether it's poetical or simply low." " Not poetical whatever it is," said Ronald, 

 assuming a look of horror^-" not poetical. Whatever you do, don't 'write me down an ass 1 like old Dogberry." " Poets are not asses, Ronald," said Israene, indignantly; "it is horrible of you to say so. It is the only one of your opinions with which I totally disagree." Ismene was very fond of poetry�in fact had written some herself, though not for all the world would she have allowed Ronald to know it. He would laugh at her. He was most un merciful to anything like sentiment. He prided himself on being practical�eminently practical �and could no more have been persuaded to read a page of Tennyson than he could " The Whole Duty of Man." He was not of a poeti cal or a religious turn of mind, as he privately confided to Ismene, though he diligently went to church and sat in the Rectory pew, looking as though the one object of his life was to absorb and assimilate the mild teachings and quaint moral reflections of the rector. " I shall be miserable if the flood does come while you are away, Ronald," said Ismene after her protest against his denunciation of poetry �resorting to the matter which was much nearer to her heart; we shall not be able even to know where you are." "No, there is neither mail nor telegraph where I am going to," said Ronald laughing, " but you need never fear about me, Ismene. I can take good care of myself, and he who is to be hanged will never get drowned, you know." "Oh, don't Ronald/ said Ismene, remon stratingly, and she withdrew her hand from his. His mood to-night jarred upon hen. She felt the separation so much; she was still unhinged by the shock of Mrs. Verner's death. She had quite thought Ronald would not have had to leave her again before their marriage. It was a sharp trial to her, and she fancied ne was too indifferent about it; in fact he scarcely seemed to think about it at all. She was wrong; it was only the difference between man and woman; she making .her idol the centre of all her world, he leaving her only a very small share in his. Orraond watched Ismene, as she withdrew herself from him, for about the space of half a minute, deep admiration mingled with amuse ment pourtrayed on his face. He loved her dearly, but he loved to tease her a little; it was very seldom he was able " to get a rise" out of bis little girl; when she did in the feeblest way oppose his sovereign will she looked so pretty, so fragile, so utterly helpless, and so completely in his power in all her desperation, that he loved her better than ever. " No, no; now I am not going to have that, Ismene," he exclaimed, and with one step he was beside her again and had got her safe in both his arras. "You are not to be vexed or hurt, dear. I know you think I don't care enough about going away�but I only pre tended, to see if my little wife really cared about me. I like to make you show you love me, Ismene darling," he said quite gravely and earnestly now, looking into the depths of the dark-blue eyes. " Sometimes you are so quiet, so self-contained, I fancy you don't care forme, but you do, don't you, my own !" Ismene's only answer was to draw her arm more closely round his neck. So peace was re established, and when Mrs. Powis called them in to tea Ismene was as blithe as a canary bird, and Ronald looked as if he could never take his eyes from feasting on her face. She was reconciled to his going�reconciled to whatever he wished�only he must not stay away a day longer than was necessary. "It would not be so bad if we could hear regularly from Ronald, would it, mamma?" said Ismene appealingly to her mother as they sat at tea. "No; one cannot help getting anxious," re plied Mrs. Powis. " I shall write whenever I have an oppor tunity: you may be quite sure of that, said Ronald decidedly. " I wish there was as good a chance of my getting letters from you." "Ay, but we are safe at home; nothing can happen, you know that." r Not a bit safer than I shall be in the bush," said Ronald. "Does not the same hum, hum," he continued, with a look of comic de precation at the vicar, who he knew had a great horror of sacred quotations being used in joke. 

 Chapter VI. That evening came to an end all too soon. Before dawn next morning Ronald was to be off, the flocks in his charge having already been despatched ahead, while he lingered till the very last. It was very late to travel, even as it was, and if it had not been a certainty of death to remain at home, and a chance of life to travel, Mr. Gurney would not have started them so late in the season. Although there had been a few showers in February there had been no rain to speak of, and now the sky looked as steely clear, and the sun shone as fiercely as if it had been midsummer instead of the end of March. So it continued all through April�on into May. Ismene had had three letters from Ronald two very soon after he left; the third had been five weeks reaching its destination. When he wrote all was well, but the herbage grew scantier day by day, in spite of all ms wanderings, and his flock was terribly thinned since he set out. Mr. Gurney received a letter at the same time as Ismene received her third letter, but of different matter probably; and after he had read it he looked graver and more care-worn even than he did before. He had a high opinion of Ormond's judgment in all station matters, and the desponding view which Ronald took of the prospect coincided only too well with the squat ter's own. " Surely the rain must come," he said, as he wearily alighted from his horse at the door of the principal hotel of Warroo. and waited till Mr. Powis, who was at a little distance, got up with him. " I dread to think of what will be the state of the country if it does not," was the reply. " Ruin," said the squatter, gloomily. " The health of the country is beginning to suffer too," said the parson. Mr. Gurney made no reply. The health of the colony did not interest him at the present moment; the thousands of his dying sheep were on his mind, to the exclusion of everything else. " Your dam holds out, I suppose?' said Mr. Powis, after a pau�e. " Pshaw ! Yes, it holds otit�a teacup to an ocean." " No news from Ormond ?" asked Mr. Powis. "No, not since the last letter of the same date as yours. Same date, not same matter," said Mr. Gurncy, smiling feebly. He was very fond of Ismene, and always took an interest in hearing about her. 

 " Possibly not," said Mr. Powis. " You don't expect him back yet, do you ?" I don't expect anything, roan. I don't expect, and I don't care. I have given it all up; I have done all I can do." The observation might have deluded one to thinking that Mr. Gurney was taking a philo sophical view of the situation; but, if so, one would have been egregiously mistaken. Ho was only thoroughly worn out. He had thought and thought, and planned and tried, till he could think and try no longer; and it was not Ehilo�ophy but utter hopelessness that made im say he did not care. He went slowly into the hotel, after wishing Mr. Powis good day, like a man bent down with care. YLe was reputed to be a wealthy man, and yet it was quite true when he said that the drought meant ruin. It was true of him, and of many more; the poor ones had succumbed long ago, and only the richest could hold out muchlonger. "It must rain soon," he said to the lawyer, business with whom had brought him into town. " I should not be surprised if it rained to morrow," said the man of law. " What ?" said the squatter, starting, as if he had been shot; and then, as he remembered the incompetency of the man to pronounce on the supreme question of the weather, his face clouded again. " No such luck," he muttered. " Well! I don't know. lam not much of a weather prophet," replied the lawyer, not at all offended by the small credit given to his predic tions ; but I had an old bushman with me to day, and he said he noticed several things that betokened rain. Old Merles is pretty shrewd about such matters. I am sure I wish to heaven it would; our tanks have been empty ever so long." " Ettu Brute /" and the squatter turned away with suppressed disgust. To talk of house tanks empty to a man with a hundred thousand starv ing sheep ! It was too much! Truly every heart knows its own bitterness. " Did old Merles say it looked like rain ?" said Mr. Gurney, coming up to the lawyer again. " Yes, he did." replied Mr. Marks, continuing his writing, while the squatter walked to the window and looked up at the heavens. It was a little past mid-day ; the sun was at its zenith, and the flood of yellow light spread over the clear sky. There was a yellowish shade, less of the steely blue than yesterday. " I believe there is a change," he said. The lawyer left his writing, and came to the window too, but the indications required a more experienced eye than his to read them. Not a cloud was to be seen. There was the same flood of sunlight; the same blinding glare; the same gaseous dancing movement in the air that indicates great heat. "It is as hot as at Christmas," said Mr. Marks, after a diligent survey, which revealed nothing to him but a continuance of the hot weather which they had endured for so long. He had sufficient tact to conceal his unsatis factory conclusion from His client. Mr. Gurney did not answer. He was too deeply engrossed with own thoughts. He concluded his business with Mr. Marks, and rode back to Pickering, always looking round him anxiously. There was a change. There could be no doubt about it now. The sky was overcast: clouds rolled slowly up, but would the rain fall after all? Several times in the past three months the clouds had gathered, day after day, and it seemed as if the eagerly desired rain must fall, and each time they had dispersed and vanished, leaving the great expanse of heaven untarnished azure as before. For six days after Mr. Gurney's visit to Warroo the clouds continued to gather thicker, darker, lower each day; then the rain came. Not a shower, not a storm, but a steady rain which gathered force gradually till the outburst was as if the flood-gates of heaven had been opened, and the long pent-up contents were poured out upon the earth. Cattle and horses shrank from its fury, and turned their hind quarters to the tempest. Scarcely could whip or spur urge an unhappy beast to face it. For a little while the bullock drays in the remoter parts of the country battled with the driving rain; then they gave it up, and, turning their wasted tired teams adrift, they camped in their drays, and waited till the rain should cease. It was long before that time came. 

 Chapter VII. Ronald had said that a six days' rain would not leave much mark, Even a six days' deluge did not; the "thirsty" earth absorbed it as it fell; but then, as the torrent still continued, the face of the land gradually underwent a change. Every creek and gully became a river, boiling, foaming, tossing as it dashed along, carrying in its swift current logs, uprooted trees, the bodies of dead beasts, and debris of all description. Each river, that a fortnight before had crept sluggishly along at the bottom of its bed, now surged and tumbled, overflowing its banks and flooding the surrounding country. All landmarks were obliterated, and the fruit of many a month of labour was swept away. There was loss of property, loss of crops, loss of stock, loss of human life�a scene wild, strange, and pitiful; but the consequence of which would be increased fertility, augmented riches, and new life. So it is all through this strange scheme of creation. * Stagnation, starvation, struggle, ruin, death; then peace, prosperity, and life; a never-ending cycle; the mystic circle of tho Egyptians; the serpent with its tail drawn through its mouth, symbol of eternity; from life, death�from death, life. Nothing will die, All things will change Through eternity. And so the rain that was to do so much future good, and did so much present evil, came down. And the squatters smiled and groaned alter nately ; ana the farmers groaned all the time, as is their wont; and the dwellers in the towns said, " Rain had been wanted�but now there had been quite enough, and it ought to cease;" and, in spite of all, the rain continued�now a spell, a brightening in the heavens like a false hope, and then storm again. No one rejoiced so little in the greatly-needed rain as Ismene. She was not indifferent to the miseries of starving sheep and cattle; indeed when they came before her notice in detail she fretted herself about them, as most true-hearted women do; and she had sympathised with the troubles of the farmers in the outlying districts of her father's parish; but now while others were regarding the good that the rain was going to do she was thinking of the danger to which it exposed Ronald. She did not talk much about her fears; she was not greatly given 

 to express her feelings; but the thought of Ronald was never absent from her mind ; from the perils of the flood she prayed daily, hourly, that he might be delivered. Of course to have tidings of him was impossible; all communica tions had been stopped at the beginning of the flood. At length the rain ceased; the sun shone out bright and warm on the inundated land�the surface waters drained themselves away, though the rivers were still swollen ; almost visibly to the eye the green grass sprang up, and, even in spite of the winter time, the black bare patches where the bush fires had passed were clothed with verdure. Three weeks had passed since the rain ceased, and still Ismene had no news of Ronald. She was not surprised or alarmed at the fact itself, because many of the rivers, as she knew, were still unfordable, and in several places out west the telegraph wires were down. There was nothing for it but to bear and be patient. Meanwhile Ormond was not without his share of trouble and anxiety. He had managed fairly well for his charge, and the slight spring in the grass saved them from fear of further starva tion ; but it laid them open to other ills, for in the emaciated state to which roost of them had been reduced the new grass produced disease. So he was worried about the sheep, and more worried still at being such a long way from Warroo, and out of the way of all communica tion. With the exception of two or three letters at the beginning of his journey, he had not heard from Ismene since he left, and, though he had several times written on the chance of his letters getting posted by the travellers whom at rare intervals he had encountered, he knew that the probability was they would never reach her �as in fact they never did. He had shaped his course homeward for some time, but the flooded rivers impeded his progress, and for him, as for Ismene, there was nothing but patience; and so, half sulkily, he camped beside his sheep and resigned himself to wait. The exercise of patience was much harder work to his vigorous impetuous nature than it was to his gentle lady love. The men who were with him had not a very good time of it. At last the rivers subsided, and Orraond made a good stride on his homeward way, to his own great satisfaction, as well as to the satisfaction of all concerned. He was still on the wrong side of the Cabool ture river, which swept along with its swollen turgid waters, carrying in its course drift timber and the hundred other impedimenta which it had collected in its career. "Surely no one would be so mad as to attempt to cross yet," he said to the man who was at his elbow. They had ridden down to the river to take note how matters were going. " I should think not," said his companion, after a pause which both had spent in a pro* tracted stare in one particular direction; " nevertheless that looks to me uncommon like a buggy" �and he screwed his hand up after the fashion of a telescope to take still closer observation. "I cannot make it out; let's ride down," said Orraond. They put their horses to a briskttrott t and were soon near enough to make out that it was really a buggy and a pair of horses that were standing at the head of the usual crossing place, and that the driver, whoever he was, was trying to make the horses face the stream. " The man must bo mad!" cried Ormond. " Oh! maybe he knows the parts well," said Joe�a man who served as cook to the camp. "I've heard say there is a good bottom just about there." "Bottom! �what can any man know about the bottom after such a flood?" exclaimed Ormond fiercely. "Why, there may be a hole there big enough to swallow a town for all he knows." Joe made no reply; he shook his head doubt* fully and watched. It was such a hazardous proceeding that he had come to the conclusion that the driver of the buggy must have made some examination of the crossing-place and had satisfied himself of its safety. " If they are not swept away by the current, they will be knocked down by the timber," said Ormond excitedly. The buggy now was at the water's edge ; the river ran rapidly, covered with great patches of foam where its course was impeded by some tree or log that had anchored to the side or bottom. It did seem mad indeed to cross, no matter how well acquainted with the ford at other times the driver may have been ; and Ormond and his man looked on shudderingly. They could do nothing, the loudest shout would be lost in the noise of the waters, and the driver of the buggy was too intent on his horses to notice anything else. It was evident that he was a skilful driver as well as a powerful man ; he had his horses well under control, and though the animals, terrified at the roar of the seething river at their feet, reared and plunged with all their might, he mastered them. He got them into the water, and for the first few minutes all went well. The descent was gradual; the horses found good footing, and though still inclined to be restive, with ears thrown back and eyes dilated, showing they well knew the danger, they made way steadily. [TO BE CONTINUED.] 

 The Brisbane Girls' Grammar School may now be considered an accomplished fact, the full sum of �2000 required by the Act having been subscribed at the solicitation of Sir Oharles Lilley and Mr. L. A. Bernays, who have been good enough to make a personal canvass on behalf of the institution. As most of our readers are aware, the Girls' Grammar School has heretofore tteen conducted as a branch of the Boys' School, although in separate premises. Up to last year it received an annual grant of �500 from the Treasury, but as demands of a similar nature were being made by other towns, the Legislative Assembly at length refused to vote the item. A number or influential gentlemen then started a movement for placing the school on a separate foundation, and they are much to be congratulated on the success of their endeavours. Under the Grammar Schools Act they will now be able to claim 4"4000 from the Government towards the buildings, thus making �GOOO available for that purpose, in ad dition to a permanent endowment of �1000 a-year. This assistance will place the future of the school beyond doubt, and preserve it from the ignoble necessity of frequent appeals for eleemosynary aid. If the Crown Lands De partment will bestir itself to convey to the trustees a suitable site, the building may be undertaken forthwith.
