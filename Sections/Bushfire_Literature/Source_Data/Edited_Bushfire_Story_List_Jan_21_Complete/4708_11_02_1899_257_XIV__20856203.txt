 CHAPTER XIV. 

 By "Old Bushman." 

 Mr. Saunders left at the time stated, and he and his daughter arrived in Brisbane safely, having passed a pleasant fortnight in Sydney, and had a smooth passage up 

 the coast. A good time was aleo enjoyed in Brisbane, wh�re the cool season had set in, and gaiety was the order of the day. A day's travelling by train brought them to Dalby, and the following morning they left by coach for Roma and Charleville. Mr. Saunders bad arranged in Brisbane for 'box seats on the coach, taking a letter from Cobb and Co.'s manager to the driver, saying he wished to break his rule of not allowing a lady on the box. " Bob Collins had a terrible accident once through a lady grasping the reins," he ex plained, " and since then will not allow them on the box without special instructions- from us. We put up-with the old chap's fad, as fl[p is one of our most reliable <men, absolutely honest end sober, and a splendid wbic" -Bob Collins, or Piebald Bob as he was frequently called, owed his peculiar soubri quet to the fact of hla having driven a coach with flour piebald borcea into Ballarat some years before. He was a tall, stern-looking man, with a Yankee type of face, full of anecdotes of the reads in all the colonies, but tactiurn to a degree unless he took a fancy to the passengers on the box. Jean was placed between the driver and Mr. Saunders, well wrapped up, for the mornings in that high country were cold and frosty. Beyond a quick; comprehensive glance, the driver took no notice of her, and the Journey was begun in silence, the travellers hugging their wraps tightly, their breath floating away visibly as the horses rattled along, the hard black-soil road. At the end of the first stage a breakfast of steam ing steak was ready for them, to the in tense satisfaction of Mr. Saunders, who de clared he had not felt such an appetite for years. During the first day Jean did not exchange a word with Bob, though Mr. Saunders, by a few judicious questions, got on fairly amicable terms with him. 'By midday on Tuesday Bob's curiosity had been aroused by Jean's apparent determination not to speak to him, and, more or less softened by her beauty no doubt, broke the Ice by aaldng her if she liked coach travelling. Jean's warm affirmative apparently pleased him, for before they reached the end of ffl�*3ay's stage he was telling her amusing stories of some of bis passengers. Shortly after leaving Ulebah on the last day of Bob Collins's conductorship, the horses shied violently at a dead bullock, while crossing a rough gully, and Bob was so pleased with Jean's utter absence of fear that he metaphorically took her to his heart, and as a proof of his full apprecia tion recounted his notorious and terrible accident. " I was driving for the* company between (Melbourne and Ballarat," Bald he, " when an old mate of mine over in Olppsland took 'very ill, and as I was due for a holiday, and he would lose his pay until be got well, which he could not stand, having a large family, I offered to drive for him. The manager agreed, and over I went. The chap who was acting for Sam travelled over the track with me once, co as I would know it. and then left. It wasn't a bad road, nonslderin' It ran ovdr hills a goodish bit, but there was one nasty pinch called the Hump which I thought would be a terror' in wet weather, and I wasn't far wrong. " The* road zigzagged up until it reached thd top cf the Hump, when it went down pretty sharp, winding alongside of a deep gully, which got deeper and deeper unfll it became a regular precipice, but there ?wan plenty of room between the side of tie hill and the gully. prov rdln' you didn't meet anything, nor nothing wrtit wrong. How ever, I wasn't a nervous chap, and there waa a good double brake on the coach, so I didn't expect anything to happen. " I had been about a week on the road when I got a letter from Sam, saying he was pretty strong again, and would be over next day to take his coach. And I wasn't rorry, for I missed my old friends on tbtf Ballarat road, and wanted to get back to my own teams, which were much faster than Sam's. " I left with a light load on my last aown trip. There were thrf a inside, two men and one lady, and a gentleman and a lady on the box, the latter of course being next to m*. the luggage and mailbag� being stowed on tbe rack and on the top of the coach. The night had been very close and muggy, and as we started, Scrammy Billy, the ffrrom, caVI. " You'll get a wet skin to-day, Bob, or call me a goanna." Thrt-e certain ly was a bad looking cloud risin' to the South, and the air was close, but I didn't think there would be a storm before night : but o'd Scrammy was right. " Tho gent on the box was a commercial �travelled, and as he was a good hand at telling yarns, he kept us laughin' all the mornln'. A few mllon before we came to the risin' ground leadin' up to the Hump, the* lady who happened to look behind her said, ' My goodness, what a storm's corain* up.' " I looked round, and sure enough we wc*r<> in for it. Behind us there wn� no shelter for miles, and in front nothing until we had got down the* other Fide of the Hunrn So, hoping we would ge^ there before the storm struck up, I sung out to the leaders, and we palled aw?.v at a good race. But It was no us\\ for whe�.i we were within half a-mile of the top flown ca�ne the storm full blast; fortunately it was behind us, and the horses pulled on gamely. The top of lh�-� Hump was as bare as your hand, so we did not Btop there, but started down the other side. The rain had made* the track very greasy, but I had a good hold of the horset. 

 and the traveller helped me with the double brake. The* lady had covered her head with a shawl at first, but had token it away from ber face Just as the lightning struck a tree alongside the noad. The near-side leader, a flash beast of a mare, made a plunge, nearly knocking her mate off hlB legs, and bringing the wheels mighty close to the -edge of the gully. The- lady gave a scream, and grabbed the offside reins. The, horses were over the side in a second, and as the coach lurched after them the thought ruahed through my mind we are all dead men. " When I came to, I was lying amongst leome bushes with part of the top of the coach alongside me. My face and head were bleeding, and my right shoulder was a good deal bruised. After wiping the blood out of my eyes I saw a dead horse.a few yards away, and aB my head became clearer set to work to find what had become of my passen gers. " First of all I cooeed a few times, but got no answer, and gave up most hope of find ing them alive. The lady and the commer cial were lying anuoogst some rocks further down the gully, within a few feet of one another, quite dead. Further on I discov ered two of the inside passengers, one man and the woman breathing and unconscious, and they seemed to be badly smashed up, but the other inside man I couldn't find high or low. Two of the hor�e� had been killed, one stood with a broken fore leg, and the fourth lay quiet with a broken back. The poor brute was quite sensible, and fol lowed me with its eyes, ac much as to say, ' What'e up, old chap, why can't I move V �' It was tough work getting up on to the road again, for I was very stiff, but I managed It at last, and set off for the pub lic-house where the next change of horses was, about two miles away. " I had hardly covered half the distance when I met the publican and three othev iE-en with a spring waggon and mattresses and blankets. The missing passenger had not been �o severely hurt as the rest of us, and had olimbed out of the gully and follow ed the road down in a dazed state of mind. All they could gather from him was that there "had been an accident to the coach, and as his out face and torn clothes pointed to un upset, 'Barton' decided to come to our help. He knew things must be pretty bad, or I would have ridden one of the horses for resistance, 00 made his hest pace towards us. " The inside passengers were still insen sible, so with the aid of ropes we got them up as soon as possible, fearing they might come to and feel the pain caused by the rough handling, wh'ioh couldn't he helped. Barton and one of the men then returned, while I and the others hauled the dead "bodies up on to tbe road, and collected the mall and luggage, we put the injured horses out of their misery, and sat by the road until the waggon came back for us. " Strange to say, with the exception of a broken leg, the lady didn't show any bad 6lgns 'of injury. The commercial was crushed the most, as tihe coach had fallen on top of him. " When we got to the pub., the wounded passengers were in bed and being looked after by the landlady, who was �s kind as if they had been her own brother and sister. The gentleman had come to, and had inquired where he was ; but the lady kept unconscious until evening. A doctor, wlho had been sent for, said she had some broken ribs and a fractured skull. The man had a broken leg, and probably some inside injuries. The man who had given the alaTm turned out the worst case of all, for towards evening he became sullen and stupid, and remained that way until he died four years after. " As soon as I had a wash and a change of clothes, I put the mails on Barton's buggy, and finished my stage. . Next day Sam took charge, and I only wartrt another day to give my evidence at the coroner's in quest, and then returned to my old beat. " And this is the reason, Miss Saunders," he concluded, " why I don't like ladies on the box seat. Can you blame me ?" " No, indeed," sighed Jean, and her arm pressed against Bob's conveyed fullest sym pathy to him. The following morning Bob was at the coach to see them off. Shaking 'Mr. Saun ders and Jean warmly by the hand, he eaid to their new driver, " Look after 'em, Billy, old man, they're worth it." Billy Woods, their new conductor, was of quite a different type Vo Bob, being short and stout, with cheeks ac rosy as an apple. His tongue was continually going ; when tot talking to his passengers or calling out to some traveller, he addressed his horses. Billy's good temper was proverbial, and it was eaid of him, after a trying journey in hot wet weather, when he had to ride bareback for forty miles, and convey the mails shing across two horses, without any help, Jie had declared with a hearty laugh that " It was the worst bknomin' trip any driver had ever made." However, he was not a "bore, so the three days passed quickly, the nights being spent at roadside pubs., where plain but good food, and cleanliness, prevailed. 

 CHAPTER XV. Donald, not feeing able to hire or pur chase a buggy, had borrowed one from the commissioner, which was a roomy, comfort able vehicle, capable of carrying three per sons and part of the luggage, the remain der being placed upon packa. The arrival or Mr. Saunders and Jean caueed a sensation in the little township, for the young Saunderse9 were well known and popular, while their stations had a high reputation, so that quite a crowd had as sembled when the coach pulled up in front of the Royal Hotel. 'During the evening acquaintance was made with eotne of the surrounding squatters, who warmly Invited the travellers to visit them. The next day was spent in Charlevllle. ae Mr. Saunden* felt stiff after Wia six days on the coach, and thought he and Jean would be better for the neet. The latter has recovered wonder fully, and declared she had never felt better. She certainly was very beautiful, and two or three young fellows from the neighbourhood looked pensive, and heaved big sighs, for at least a week after they had 6een her. It took th� party four days to reach Kooralgin, and they camped* cut the neces sary three nights. A tent was erected for Jean's use, while her father slept between a bough 'break-wind and the lire, and upon 

 the other aide of the latter Donald was camped. Jerry had a fire to hlmeelf. Nothing of any consequence took place during the Journey to the station. Donald drove, as he knew the peculiarities of the road, Jean being ibeside him, and Mr. Saunders on the back' seat, Jerry driving the spare horses behind the vehicle. At noon a meal va� made, and a pair of fresh horses put in, and a good pace maintained until near sundown, when a camp was made for the night. Qrase and water were plentiful, �o that no particular stages had to be made, and the travellers halted whenever the time suited. As I did aot expect the party would rest a day in Cnarleville, I weB rendered very anxious at their not arriving on the day I expected, and decided to go to meet them, if they did not appear on the second d�y. However, at about 3 o'clock on the follow ing afternoon, the rattle of buggy wheels wm 'heard coming rouo'd the ridge, and 1 niched out in tim.e to be first to welcome fbem. One look at Jean's face was suffi cient, and as I lifted her from the buggy I could not resist giving her a ihug, which I hoped passed unnoticed by any one else. Jean was shown to the room which had been prepared for her, and proceeded to make some change in her attire, ftSt her father declared in favour of a- swim, stating he had not had a decent wash since he left Oharleville. * iMr. Saunders in a quiet way made it evi dent to me that he understood the atate of affairs existing between -me and �Jean, so that I had no hesitation in making up my mind to take advantage of the first opportunity of asking the momentous ques tion. I shall never forget the first evening �pent by Jean at Koorailgin. For the first time in the history of that first-class graz ing property a lady officiated at the teapot. Usually the cook poured out the tea when the table was laid, and left us to help our selves to milk and sugar, or sometimes Donald or Charley, whichever happened to be there, " played woman," as they termed it. What a charming pioture she presented. Her dress wao of warm texture, and dark in colour, admirably fitted to set off her beautiful colout and perfect figure. Her hair was done up in a fashion quite differ ent to that obtaining when I had seen her last, t>u< which suited her Spanish cast of features. Mr. Saunders declined to take the head of the table, saying I was boss wibether he was there or not, and with Jean at the other end the position was co sugges tive that she set about her duties with .a nervous little laugh and a very becoming blush. Mr. Saunders apparently did not ccc any thing amusing an the matter, but Charley sniggered and ahemined In euoh a disgusting manner that if my Jook had been as potent as a charge of dynamite we should have had gneat difficulty in gathering up his remains. After tea Charley redeemed his lest char acter for common sense by carrying off his father and Donald to the store to show them a wonderful greenbide rope of hi*.own mak ing, and left Jean and me to ourselve�. Showing some slight signs of embarrass ment Jean walked on to the veranda, where I 'immediately Joined her, and, taking her hand, we strolled by the bank of the lagoon, where, under the bright twinkling stars, and within hearing only of the flying-squir rels chattering in >the lofty gum-trees, and the oleadae chirping merrily amongst the bushes, I poured out the emotions with wihlch ray heart and brain bad Ib robbed �inoa Mr. Saunders's letter had arrived. And her response�l really cannot tell it, for I have no remembrance of her wcrds ; but more than an hour later she suddenly started and exclaimed, " Oh, what a time we must have been away from the house. What will father tfcink ?" But the aenslble Charley had kept hi* father so well interested in various statkn maftpra at the sto�e that they did not re turn to the bouse until after we had reach ed it. Upon their advent Jean slipped out cf the room, and Charley, who really seemed to have acquired a heap of wi�dom, said he wanted to see one of the stockmen, and left me and Mr. Saundera, 'who appeared to my excited mind to have become a ralCher for midable person, together. Twice I opened roy mouth to approach the great and absorbing subject, but my fceart failed me, and I spoke upon s-.aticn matters. 'At last, drawing a big breath, I plunged into an avowal of my feelings toward* Jean, and proceeded to point out that in a few months, taking stock and stations at a fair valuation, I should be very well off, and able to live In a civilised part of the country. Before I had got very far on with my subject, however, the old gentleman raised his hand and stopped me, eaying : "That will do, Dick; I know exactly how you stand financially, and am aware you can well afford to keep a wife, but if you had the wealth of old Tyson it would make no difference to me. I have a thorough be lief in you, and Jeanie has also, unless I am very much mistaken. It make� me very happy to know that my litVfe girl has secured a husband of whom 1 can so thoroughly ap prove. Say no more about it, my boy, but fix (the day with Jean, who will not go to you empty-handed," and tbe fine old fellow shook my hand heartily. I saw no more of Jean that night, but nex� morning, at breakfast she appeared, anfl was greeted by Charley, who had relapaed into a stato of idiocy, with : " Good morning, Mrs. Dick, ahem, I mean Miss Jean." Every day Mr. Saundore, accompanied by some of us, and frequently by Jean, rode out on the run, and expressed himself de lighted with .both the siosk and the country. When he had seen enough of Kooralgin, it was arranged that lie, I, and Charley ohou'.d go o\\er to Bunginderry, so that he nvrb: bo aM� to tei! our other partners all about their investments. Dona.'d remained w'th Jfan, who professed herself to be quite happy in the prospect of oar beins: ay.ay for a week or two, but tbt d ornirg we left, when the others were out ot the room, she extracted a promise, only too readily given, that I would come back as soon as possible. The road to Bunglnderry was full of in terest to Mr. Saunders, who of course had been told of our adventures in search of new country. Murdering camp was viewed. The poison camp was pointed 

 out. The tree where 'Tinker and 1 hil stalled off the attack of old Bogung and his mates was etill standing, but the smajl trees and the bark we had used in thd construction of our stockade had been long before consumed by bush fires. At Bunginderry also the light with the blacks was retold, and the broken panels ol the door which tad been preserved ex) hibited. : The senior partner wae well pleased wittf the run.^whleh he thoroughly inspected be* fore leaving, and told me he considered il was well worth �60,000. "It contain*,'1 said he, "(nearly 2000 square miles of first class, well-watered country, carrying 10,000 head of good cattle, end has room for ano:her 15,000. Cattle securities stand well in the market either for purchase or loans, and I think it would 'be a good plan to sell it and retain Kooralgin. Or. if there is a better offer for the latter, sell it and retain Bunginderry. I think it would be a pity to sell both, as we should have to put our money into something else which might not turn out such a good invest ment." When Mr. Saunders h&tf ridden all over the run and seen most of the cattle he stated his willingness to return; so -with visions of Jean before me I gladly gave orders to Tinker fro get our horses to gether. As Gleeson was due for a spell he came away with us, Charley remaining in hia 'Place. On the afternoon of the fourth day, aft we approached the station we were startled by the report of firearms, and pulling up to listen could tell from the whlp-iiko crack that rifles were being fired quickly somewhere in the vicinity of the head sta tion. "What can it mean?" said Mr. Saunders. " I can form no idea," I replied; " they are certainly not shooting at a mark. It may be blacks. We will drive over to the timber and have a look. If the place is being attacked we may take the niggers In the rear." " You are right," said ne, �' but for heaven's sake look �harp. Think of Jean." There was no occasion tV ,��mlnd me of her, but I knew we could be of moie ser vice by reconnoitring first than by rush ing wildly upon the scene. Besides, the number and different intonation of the re ports puzzled me, and I had a dawning idea that perhaps the assailants were bush rangers. We had often heard of small parties of these misguided men roaming the country, but there was nothing to induce them to stick up an outside cattle station like Koo ralgin, where no money or valuables of any kind were kept. With these thoughts re-; volving in my mind I asked my companion! to examine the pistols and sent the horsey along at a good gallop. The edge of the timber was quickly reached, and, making Tinker stand by the horses, 'Mr. Saunders, Gleetson, and I crept behind some trees and scanned the station, which was barely a quarter of a mile away.
