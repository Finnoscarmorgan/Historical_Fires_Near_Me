 (ALL BIQHT3 BSSEBTBD.) CHAPTER XXI. ROBSON'S TREACHERY. 

 TT'ITTY, aftor a sound nigbt'B sloop, J^-:. thanked tho pobplo- for thoir hospi tality, aud, Czarina having rocovorod from hor ovor-oxortion, shudotorminodtorotraccC her steps, and mukd for hor old homo. Sho'know whoro sho could find uo'ws of hor brothers, and probably ft' note might 

 hayu been loft in an old familiar hiding placo in caao bIio should be in that neigh borhood. Czarina, could trivvol but slowly, aud ifc was still very hot nnd oppressive, so that Kitty kopt ns much as possiblo in tho shade. . Everything soomod to glow in the hoat, and naturo droopod and languished uudor tho glare of the pitilqsB sun.- ; Tho burning smoll caused by tho bush fire still porvadod tho air, and clouds of mhokb occasionally arose when somo half-burnt treo camo crashing to tho ground. Kitty skirted tho sceno of tho' firo as much as possiblo, aud avoided the burnt timber, which was dangorous. Sho thought over her narrow oscapo of tho day boforo, aud carossod Czarina's nook in tokon of hor appreciation of tUo great race sho had run. Thon her thoughts wanderod to hor. brothers, and Ned's duol.with Donelly, nnd Bho shuddorod at tho fato that would bofall him if ho got into tho hands of tho- police She prayod he might nover bo takon alivo. It would bo far bettor for him to be shot in open conflict than Buffor an ignominious, degrading death. She bittorly rogrettafl tho course of .lifo hor brothers bad gradually fallen into. They had gono from bad to worso, and wore now desperate men, but it was not for hor to desert' them. Sho was glad hor .mother was dead, tor tho lifo her boys led would bavo broken hor heart. Kitty rodo slowly on all day for many miles. Sho had a small flask of wator and somo damper and moat tho ? boundary rider's wife had givon hor, nnd sho ate it while she restod Czarina during tho hottest part of tho afternoon. (It was aboftt five in tho afternoon, and tho mare was toiling slowly along, when Kitty commonced to recognise the surrounding scenery, and sho know sho was noaring ? her old home. She wanted to reach tho cottage, boforo night set in. Sho had not gono much f urthor whon 8ho hoard voicos, and wondering who ifc 

 could uo in this uuircquonica.Bpoc, sue hastily pulled Czarina, into the bush and waitod. . ? Tlio voices soundod nearer. Kitty started. Sho could not be mistaken. Ifc wnB Nod talking to someone. What could thoy bo doing abroad when' it waa so djuigorous for them ? Suro enough, ifc was Ned CarSy ? and Michael O'Shoa, and when Kitty rode out and faced them they were too surprised to speak. ' , Kitty looked sorrowfully at Ned, and tho tears camo into . her - eyes. That look told him sho know all, and had come out to seok him, and probably to again warn him danger was near. That bloodhound Falk must bo on tho trail again. 'Kitty!' he exclaimed, when ho had recovered from his surpriso, ' what brings you here? ' ? - ' Need you ask that, Ned ?' she said. 'I know all. I heard Harris tell his dreadful atory. Ohl Ned, what will becomo of you now?''/ ?'! 'It's all right, Kitty. You need not be alarmed,' said Ned. '.Besides/ I shot Douelly fairly enough. . He had as much chance of killing mo as I had of killing him.' . .??'*,?-.'.''. 'J,' ' '? . ' '.'.'; 'I know how you look at ifc, Nod,' she' saidj 'but othora will not take it in the, same way.' . . '.:;-.?: ? ? ? ? ''i' -.i:7. ' Where aro you going ? 'said Nod. ? ; 'I was going to our cottage'for the night. I could not remain afc Murraystono, after I heard that story,' she Baid, with a shudder. . . ' V '' ' You would havo been just as wolcomo at Sam Buxton'a as evor,' Baid' Ned. ' You ought to havo Htayod thoro, Kitty. Ifc was a safe home for you.' :' '? . ' I could not. Nod. Thoy have beon vory kind to mo, all of them. I left during tho night, and was nearly caught by trio bush firo. If ifc had not beon for Czarina I should not be alivo now,' sho said. 

 ' You must oomo with us for the night, afc any rato,' said Nod. 'Wo/shall not goto tho cottagn, Kitty. Wo will show you tho Ringholo.. .It's a snug hiding place. You will say -so when you soo it.' ' Vory well, Nod,' shosaid.: 'The cot tage, I suppose, is riot safe.' '.'-; 'No,' horopliod. 'Ifc would stand a good soigu, though, built as it is, provided it waR not fired.' ; : Michael O'Sheahnd not spokon to Kitty. Ho hardly know what to sayj . but as- Nod. rode on in front ho said to her, quietly ? '/ 'I would not say much to, Nod about that Donelly affair,. Miss. It rilos him.' 'What will become of us all ?'' said. Kitty; ?;? , '? ? .' . ;.:V :':''.y-.'- ^ ;;. ' Blest if I know,' said 6'Sliea. ?/-? You will bo all right, never fear. I oxpect somo of us will got it hot if wo liro- caught. It will bo a tough fight bofore thoy tnko tbo four of us. I reckon somo of Falk's men will go under before thoy lay hands on us; Curse thorn.' ''... . ' Whoro is Ned going ?' said Kitty. 'To tho Ringholo,' said O'Shea. 'It's a nico quiet spot. I don't fancy mJay peoploknow, about it.' ,;: :; , , ' Is ifc far from here ?' said Kitty. ' 'No,' said O'Shea'. ' We had jrist come out for a ride, and to look at, the Watch box.' ' r , ' . ' ' -'? 'You have boen thero?' aaid Kitty, 'That is where I was going, to see if Ned had lof t a letter for mo.' ?'??? . 'Ho 'did loaye -a' small, noto,' said O'Shoii, ' to let you know we wersall safe.' 'Is tho ; Watchbox as Bafo as over?' asked Kitty. ?'? ? .' 'Just,' said O'Shcft.1' The 'old treo looks quito as innocoht as over it did. It's such a handy placo, and within sight of tho cottago, too. I should ntiver havo thought that old trunk was hollowed out big enough to nllovr a couplo of mon to stand in Those loop-holos, covorod with bark, would doceivo ft black. It's a grand place. You could pop a man off from tho Watchbox without much risk. No ono could tell whoro tho shot camo from.' Kitty knew tho Watchbox well. Many n time as a girl sho had played hido.aud scek in it with hor brothors. Tho Watchbox was a huge dead troo that stood near tho Caroys' cottago. Tho trunk had beon hollowed out, and a door cut into it so wonderfully woll made that it shut, nnd formed part of tho trunk again. Loop-holos woro made large enough to liro a riilu through, and these could bo covorod with bark, which could bo gently pushed up whon required. Tho Watch box was supposed to havo been nrndo by uonio notorious bushrangors many years ago, and tho socrot had bocomo known to old Carey, who had in his turn imparted it to Ned. Many a mounted trooper had boon Bhot 

 at from tho Watchbox, and ifc was novor found out whoro the mysterious shot had come from. The sinoko from tho rifle hud gouerally curled away into upaco beforo tho astonishad countable could imagine whoro the shot had could from. Thoy wore now travelling along tho bod of a dry croek, and nob a sign of water could bo seou in it. At tho far ond Kitty saw nothing but a donso muss of brush-wood, and sho thought Nod must lmvo mistaken tho way, and thoy hud got blocked. Such, howovor, was not tho caso. Nod knew woll enough whoro ho was, and ho wns novor at fault iu any part of tho Ranges, whethor light or dark. To Kitty's surpriso. Nod rodo straight for tho donso mass of timber, and then suddonly disappeared. 'Follow mo,' said O'Shea, nnd Kitty loft Czarina to go as best she could aftor his horse. Sho could soo thoro was ft nafrow pas sa'go on either Bido, and tho bush seemed to close in aftor thoy had passed through it. .' In a fow momont3 Kitty heard voices, and as she rodo up she saw by tho faint light of tho now moon that her brother Tom was thoro. ' Tho Kiughole sooiued a safo and socuro liiding place, for ft timo at least, but it was ovideut to Kitty that they could not live thoro for any groat lougth ,of timo, moro especially in tho heat of tho summer. Tom was hoartily glad to Bee Kitty, and Nod came and gavo her a brotherly kiss, but Kitty did not seem to havo tho saino feeling towardB him now that sho had in former days. Sho contrasted the . life Maurico lod with that of hor brothers, nnd it made hor hoart ache to think what thoy might have been, and what they wero. After Tom, Rob, and O'Shea had gono to rost, Nod, who remained on guard, bad a chat with Kitty. It was a hot, sultry night, and the last glimmer of firo had died out. Brother and sister sat close togothor and. then Ned. told hor the whole truth about Donolly, and how he had made him fight, because ho had insulted his sister. Ho told hor how Donolly had tried to kill him by foul moans by shooting first, and that ho had done bis duty in ridding the 

 world of such a scoundrel. As Nod told tho story in his own plain languago, Kitty felt the motivo which prompted him to fight Donelly was tlio in Bulfc sho had received from him. This warmed her hoart towards Nod, and she nestled closer to him. ' What did Maurice think of ifc?' said Ned. ' He novor toM mo. None of them spoke to me about it,' said Kitty. ' I hoard it first from Harris. You can imagine how ifc shocked me.' , ' Kitty, you must go Track to Murray stono,' said Ned. ' I am sorry you left it. 'I -have a prosentimenfc of something evil about to happen. Kitty, Maurice loves you dearly. ;Hns ho ever told you so ?' Kitty Bighed as she said : 'No, but I think ho loves me. I love him so much, oh, so dearly, Ned, but wo can never bo anything to each other. It wouldnofcdo.' ? ' Maurico told mo ho loved you,' said Ned,'! and he promised me he would always bo truo to you, Kitty.: Ho will keep his promise. Maurice is not the sort of man to break bis.wbrd.' , .', .'Oh.'Ned, you should not have asked him'to do that,' said Kitty; 'Ifc was not right.' '.;''? ?-.??'? '.. .'? ?'.-''.? ;?? 'Maurice spoko of it first, Kitty,' said Nod;' ?? I waited to make sure ho was in earnest. I',- did it for the best. Ho 'will take care' .'.of you whon wo are gone,, Kitty. ^ This Borfc of life cannot go on inueli longer. I feel there is somo danger at hand, and that wo shall soon have to fight for our lives. Ifc is not your fault, Kitty. No ono will blame you. As Maurice, Buxton'b wifo you will bo ablo to hold |up your head .with anyone. Maurico is Btiro to have Murraystoiie whon old Sam Buxtoh dies, and thou you will bo so happy, and not' far from your old homo. You will think about tho lads Bomotimes, won't you, Kitty?' : ' Don't talk like that. Nod,' sho said, ' I cannot boar it. ? II I you leave the colony all ni-iy yet bowpllj as for Maurice and mysoif, you can leave that to Provi dence. iPerhapB if you got safely away to another land, :Nedi we may bo happy together,' 'but if you are caught then t- ï¿½ 'sho bositatod. ''What then. ?' .'', . ,''.' .'. Oh, do not ask mo, . Ned. Do not nBk me; ' and , Kitty . pufc her head on his shouldor, and sobbed as though hor hoart would break. ?''?' ??Como, , Kitty,' hS said, trying to bo clieerful, ^you.ruusfc not givo way like this. Wo hivyo money noyfjonough to mako a frosh Btart, and whon wo see a chance wo moan to make a bolt of it, indeed we do this timo, Kitty, for tho country is too hot. to hold'uB.' ^, '. ,:'l.--..'- .'.,-. ? ,.'. ' ' ! 'ianisd glad, Ned,' Baid Kitty, 'but you must not delay, for Falk and his, men are at Murraystone,' arid' will scour', tho: country for you.' ',' , .''..',. , While Kitty arid Ned were talking afc tho Ringholo, innpector Falk and his troops, riccoinpaniod by Maurice Buiton, were: in pursuit of. tho Caroys.. Benjamin Rojjson, who had boon torribly cufc.iipat the fate that had befallen Donolly, and was, in foar of his own lifo, determined to bo'ovon with the Caroys. Robson know every inch of tho country in which his station .wns, and he 'know of the existence of tho Ringholo, and by an accidont ho had discovered that was the haunt of tho Caroys. Ho felt certain ho could find the placo again, although ifc might tako him somo timo to do so. Whon Robson hoard Inspector Falk and his men' woro out Bcouring tho country, lnï¿½ determined to put them on tho right track, although ho did not want to bo Identified by the Caroys In the matter. Ho rodo out to meet Falk nnd told tho Inspector all he know about tho oxistonco or tho llinghole, and that it was tho Curoya' hiding placo. Falk dospissd him for giving tho infor mation, and yet could not help being inwardly delightod at the prospect of run ning hie mon to ground. ' You must show us the way to tho Ring hole,' Bftid Fnlk. ' Not I,' said Robson. ' I would not bo seen noar it. Nod Curoy would murdor mo like lie murdered Donolly if lio thought I had givon you the information.' ' Servo you right,' muttorcd Maurico, who3O sympathies woro all with tho Careys, although ho despised thoir acts. He felt that whoro Nod Carey was. thero he should find Kitty. ' Now, look hero, Mr. Robson,' said Inspector Falk, 'this is not ft time for trifling. Wo shall novor be able to find our way to tho placo if you do not show us. You will havo to guide ua to the place, at 

 nil ovonts until wo are so noar to it that thero will not bo the slightest danger of our missing it. You can rido on iu front with Harris and show us tho way.' ' Not I,' said Robson. ' It's not part; of my duty. I will toll you how to find tho place, and that will havo to do you. I want to see Ned Carey hangod, but I'm d ? d if I want to bo shot by him first. That's not in my lino at all.' 'If you do not go on in front with Harris I shall have to make you,' said Falk. ' You daro not,' said Robaon. ' Yes, I daro,' said Falk. ' You aro tbo only man that knows whoro tho Ringhole i'b, and I moan to make you tako us thero 

 whethor you liko it or not. Maurice was dulighted at the look of alarm he saw on Robsqu's face. Tho man was an arrant coward aftor all. Robson protested, but all to no purpose. Inspector Falk was firm, aud at liiHt Kobson had to givo way. Fulk promised that ho should havo a safe position iu tho roar onco they woro safely within bail of the hiding place. Robson and Trooper Harris rode on in front, tho remainder following, and Maurico did not half liko tho sonsation of being included in the 'inan-hunfc' ns ho called ifc. ' I'm used to ifc,' said Falk. 'It's part of my ordinary routiuo lifo. You'll be suro to find Kitty with hor brothers j that ought to bo some consolation to you.' Early in tho morning aftor Kitty had reachod the Ringholo with Ned, Inspector Falk and his men woro treading tho dry oreok that lod to tho hiding placo. Robson pointed out tho way to ontor, and said ho did not know of any other entrnuco or exit, and the mon would bo trappod liko rats if they woro thore. Another oxit, howovor, didoxistof which Robaon know nothing. Kitty was fust asleop, and Ned slumbered restlessly noar her, -while Tom and Rob woro on guard nonr tho entrauco. As u Bual, everything waa in readinosa for a surpriso. Thoir rovolvors woro all loaded, and the liorsos saddled aud ready to mount at a moment's notice. Tom Caroy was brighteuing up his rovol vor whou ho paused at hiB work and listened. ' What's up,' said Rob. ' Fanciod I heard the tramp oï¿½ a horse's hoof,' Baid Tom. ' Nonsonso,' Baid Rob, ' Nobody knows about this place.' 'Hark,' said Tom, now thoroughly on the alert. ' I hear something,' said Rob. ' Go and wake them while I go and have a look through tho gap,' Baid To m. He wont towards the small opening and peered through tho bushes. In the meantime. Rob baa roused tho sleepers, and thoy wore all in readiness. Tom camo running back in hot lias to. ' Hurry up ; no time to lose,' he said. 'Falk and his men are hero, and Maurice Buxton'a with them. Ho must have shown them tho way.' Kitty's hoart gave a lanp. ' No, Tom,' she said, ' I'll nevor bolieve it. Ho did not know of such a place.' ' No more ho did,' Baid Ned, as he helped Kitty on to Czarina. 

 They woro all mounted, and Ned rode to the opening. He saw Falk and a couple of men quite closoat hand, but they could not see him. Then ho caught a glimpse of Robson, and he thought in a moment : ' That's the man that has betrayed us. Ho knew of this place ; Maurice did not. Wo'll mako for the other side, and get out that way j there's timo enough yet. I've a good uiind to fire a parting shot, but I can't sparo a bullet now; it may como in useful later on.' Ho rodo back ' and thoy all galloped across the open spaco to a spot on tho far side... Hero was a slit in tho rock just wide onough for one at a.timo to piiBB through. ' Quick, Kitty, go first,' said Ned. She went through, and Rob followed, thon O'Shea and Tom. Ned was about to enter, when ho heard a shout, and saw Falk and Harris riding across the opon at a gallop. Ho shook liis fist afc thorn, and then guided Settling Day quickly through. 1 (To be Continued.)
