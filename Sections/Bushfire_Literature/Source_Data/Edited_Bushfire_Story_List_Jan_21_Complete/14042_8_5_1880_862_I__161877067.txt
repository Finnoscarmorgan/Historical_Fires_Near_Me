 ' Oh, what damned minutes tells^he o'er Who dotes, yet doubts ; suspects, yet fondly loves ! ' � Othello' 'When Caleb Woodford came out to Australia, thirty years ago, with �15 10s. good English money in hia pocket, a stout heart, a bull neck, a Presbyterian hug of his Bible 

 ouu i_u.K uilvuuvu u* iwnuiuiug AJ.VJA11U Ul 11 VC V Ultra ? UL luQ ^m outside, with, he hoped, 'a tidy sum' as the fruits of I his industry, he little dreamt that he would never ses ? Piinlico again � that he would become the owner of the I largest sheep station in Gippsland, and would actually fall B in love with and marry an actress. Yet all this, and very I much more that Caleb never bargained for, came about I quite naturally. ? It was, of course, before gold had been discovered, and hid fi struggles were hard indeed for a year or two. But an uncle I having died very opportunely and bequeathed him �250, his I prospects became brighter; success attended his specula- I tions ; he bought a few thousand store sheep for next to ? nothing, from a poor devil who was ' hard up ;' selected a ? run in north-eastern Gippsland ; built a homestead, stock- I yard, and wool-shed ; got a dam made, huts erected � in a ? word, the fillip his uncle's legacy gave to his fortunes soon ? placed him in possession of a thriving sheep-station. Ha flj was prudent in money matters, persevering, and economical ; B and in a few years he became a rich man. ? How he came to wed the actress, [however, is, when his U religious character and prejudices are considered, incompre- Hj hensible ; he himself, in fact, never could tell exactly how H it was brought about. He only knew that he went to flj Sydney one Christmas, became infatuated (like every ona ? else) with her singing and her beauty, was introduced to 99 her as ' the wealthy Mr. Woodford,' and, like a fool, pro� 99 posed to, and married her. 99 If any doubts ever crept into his mind as to the wisdom 99 of this step, it is very certain that none troubled Mrs. B Woodford. She was quite happy ; that is to say, she was H perfectly satisfied with her position as regards ease and 99j indulgence, and did her best to spend her husband's money wm like a queen ; but, at the same time, did not care a rush for 99 him. 99 She ! Carlotta ! with her great brown eyes, dark Italian B features, and majestic figure, care for a red-facedj red- ? haired, podgy little nonentity like that ! She, who had ? been the toast of the ' offissairs ' at Sydney '.�who, as she H always remembered with a little sigh, had, in her ' belovfc ? Itahlee,' won the love of the handsome Count Giuseppe� II something or another ! O, really, how ridiculous ! and she fjs laughed in that heartless silvery way that was so dis- 1m tiacting. H Notwithstanding this, and the jealous and choleric tern- ? perament of Caleb, nothing for some years occurred to ? disturb the marital relations of himself and Mrs. Woodford. ? 

 �ey continued much as they had begun ; on the one hand, SSmate attachment; on the other, the outward appear STof regard, but inwardly .something very much afan to d*T^ had^cluld, John, the hero of this Btoryadark fcaired, grey-eyed, whimsical little fellow. ^ day in early summer, when John was nuieymsof age, Mtb.

' Why, my dear, if you have really made up your 'Mrs Woodford smiled faintly ; eo faintly, that a casual looker-on would have thought it was merely a sunbeam glinting through the vibrating passion flowers encircling the verandah wherein she stood, and passing swiftly across her dark face. ' But remember our losses last summer, my dear � me creek dried up� all that mob we bought off Moberly suffocated in Lake Bulla : and this summer, Bullocky says, ?will be as dry. We must draw in our horses, my love� we must be prudent.' Mrs. woodford frowned unmistakably. ' However, if you must have the party� though that boy is so wild and wilful he hardly deserves it � you can send Jim. He is out boundary riding, though, I think.' ' O, no ; dere he is down by de voolshed dalking to Dan.' ' So he is. Ve.ry well, my dear, I'll go down and tell him to get readv.' ' Denk you.' Mrs. Woodford remained in the verandah for some time longer. She was certainly very beautiful ; and looked her best when well pleased, as she was then. She watched her husband's dumpy, sturdy, figure pass along by the men's hut towards the woolshed, and her lip quivered, it may be superciliously. She was then lost in thought for a few minutes ; she smiled ; she frowned ; her lips moved ; she smiled again : then, looking up hurriedly as her quick ear detected a faint canter, she shaded her beautiful brown eyes with her hand, and watched for the approaching horseman. From the rising ground on which the homestead was erected she could see the country for many miles around. On her right was a dense hazel scrub, with here and there a gigantic gum-tree ; on her left, through clumps of wattles and gum saplings, appeared at about four miles' distance, the house of Dr. Field; and in front, about two miles away, bleak stony Mount Jamieson� hall way up which she could see the white side of their old homestead, Worrarra, where she and Caleb had lived for a year or two after their marriage. In the valley at the foot of the mountain, was the little township of Warrandilla, with a faint thread of smoke rising through the warm still air from one or two of the houses. To Mrs. Woodford looking intently across the valley, it appeared as if the township were tethered to Warrarra by two narrow ribbons� one dark green, the other a dirty yellow. These were the Warrandilla Creek, and the track down the mountain from Warrarra. Along this track was coming a horseman. She could not now hear the canter of his horse ; for a bullock team had just started from the ' Diggers' Brat.' and all other sounds were, for the time being, drowned in tho distant though dis tinct klug-klug of the waggon, the clash of the yokes, tho sharp report of the teamster's whip, and his oaths of rebuke addressed to ' Strawberry,' and ' Tuppeny ' ; but she could see a dark spot creeping down the track, which her ex perienced eyes told her was the horse and rider � her son John, and his pony Dick� the faint sound of whose approach had aroused her from her reverie a few minutes i before. | Not long after, she saw his tiny figure letting down one end of the slip-rails at the foot of the clover paddock ; and then saw him lead his pony through, replace the rails, and gallop at break-neck speed the remainder of the distance. I Up he came, whooping and yelling with excess of animal spirits, as he rode through a flock of guinea fowl, which he scattered in all directions � most of them taking refuge in the neighbouring wattle trees cackling frantically. I ' Show � Show ! Giovanni ! my son ! ' I ' It's all right, mother,' he replied, laughing and dis I mounting, at the same time swinging round his head the I tail of some animal, which he was endeavouring to keep out I of the reach ef two kangaroo dogs, who were springing and I yelping about him. I *' Down, Jason ! Ha, Rover! down, sir! I say, mother, F there's a wallaby-tail for you ! Isn't it a fine one, eh Y \\ Dick and I finished that fellow, didn't we, Dick ? ' ! Dick, switching the flies from his panting sides with his [ bushy tail, and occasionally jerking the skin of his neck '? and twitching his ears, looked very knowing indeed, and was presumed to say, ' Yes, my handsome nine-year-old, \\ we did� and could do the same again with the greatest i ease ! ' \\ ' O, we had such a chase, mother ! you should have seen Dick ! You know those big rocks at the back of Warrarra ? [ Well, Dick jumped them as Jason there would ; and, with a I rush through the ferns on the other side, we baled up old [ wally against the end of the gully, and I finished him with I Bullocky's waddy. See! there s some of his hair on it I yet!' I ' Ah, my son ! (kissing him) you musd not do dat again ! I It was very dangerous.' I 'I don't see that, mother; I think 'twas fine fun. I I say, mother, usen't we live at Warrarra altogether once ? I Why don't we live there now? It's a long way better I than Quondong � there are bo many wallabys and wombats I there, you know.' I ' Yes, my 6on, ve used to lif dere before de diggairs came I ini�j SuHy1 bud day vassomuch annoyance, dat your I lander vas very kindt to build Quondong for us.

Well rim tha W'ould be pestered with questions. m �-aUim was back. Yes, back again. Was Melbourne, 

 now, really as large as Dr. Field said it was ? It wasn't five hundred times larger than Warrandilla, was it? O, yes, it was� more even than that, Jim thought. No ! Well it wasn't true, at any rate, that you could lose your way in it ? My word ! but it was, Jim said, with a vivid recollection of floundering ruefully about for a couple of hours looking for bis hostelry, the Old Lamb Inn; and then having to ask an old apple woman where it was, who pointed it out to him on the other side of the street. This was a nonplusser to John. Was that Grey Bessy doing the packing ? It was. Well, ehe knew her way home ; he would race Jim to the slip panels. No, Jim couldn't see that ; O, no, thank you ! Well, John would have a race himself � hey, Dick ! and away they went at a sling gallop in a cloud of dust. They had not gone half the distance, however, when Jim ?aw him draw rein, and, wheeling suddenly about, return ai rapidly. # ' I say, Jim, who was that black-bearded man that was riding along with you up the road there, and went into Meredith's?' Why, what eyes the boy had, to be sure ! It was a f or riner as Jim had met fifty miles out of Melbourne ; who was a gentleman, too, Jim said, for he paid for all the shouts along the road, aud wouldn't hear of Jim's pay ing, though Jim averred that he, Jim, was very anxious in deed to do so. ' A foreigner� my ! Hey, Dick !' and away they started again helter 6kelter. The day of the party came, and a blazing hot summer's day it promised to be. A soft warm haze lay on the ground, quivering upwards as the sun rose higher and grew hotter, and occasionally a hot oven-puff of air fanned the sweat bedewed faces of the shearers scattered about the wool shed and yards, preparing for the duties of the day. But just as little brown-eyed Mary Field hid arrived, and just as Kate and Susan Johnson and Sam Sweeney and Willie Butler, with boots on ! and hats ! and altogether dressed very neatly, had found their way to Quondong, the wind changed round to the south, a smart shower fell, and for the rest of the day it was delightfully cool, with, when the sun shone out again, a fine exhilarating perfume from the gum leaves. What a day they had of it, with the French windows of the homestead thrown wide open, and the balmy air pene trating the whole house, along with the chattering of the little green parrots feeding on the gum blossoms, and the ' koora � baw � koola,' of the magpies in the clover paddock. What romps they had with Jason and Rover ! what unearthly screechings on John's French horn ! and what ' tucks in ' of eatables and drinkables which they, � that is, the four plebeians, had never before.heard the names of, had never even dreamt of. The day passed off very well indeed. Mrs. Woodford interfered very little with the children, and took no part in their amusements� leaving almost everything to the manage ment of her son. It would appear, in fact, as if the party had been arranged by this proud woman for the sole purpose of nourishing the pride which John in some degree inherited from her. ' You haf a name� a familee,' she would often tell him ; and John, never very tractable, was gradually by her teaching acquiring a proud domineering manner � though, it must be said, at the same time, that he had a fair share of the manliness and good nature of his father to counteract it. Sam Sweeney � that red-haired, freckle-faced, greasy-lipped, young Victorian � thought that* on this occasion, ' Mr. John Woodford, Esquire, bossed it too blessed much,' and he made bold to say so to Susie Johnson. She did not coincide, however; which very much vexed Sam, who had constituted himself her beau, and he became very sulky, and ate a great deal, during the rest of of the afternoon. As evening closed in, Caleb Woodford, who had ridden 'away back' to an out-station a day or two before, returned very much knocked up, and disheartened with the Ioes of a fine flock of sheep, which had been driven off by the blacks and not one recovered. He got slowly off his horse, and walked wearily into the homestead. The lamps were lit in the dining-room, and the youngsters, just done tea, were gorged and happy. No mishap, wonderful to relate 2 had occurred, with the excep tion that Willy Butler, who happened to sit down with a tray of ices and jellies in front of him, thought they were meant for him, and, deeming it bis duty to finish them, set to work to clear the space before him like a reaper. When about half through, however, he got a dreadful pain in the head, another in the stomach, grew suddenly very pale, and desisted. ' Well, John, have you been enjoying yourself ? ' ' Yes, sir, very much.' ' Ah, Mary, my brown-haired little beauty ! how are you, eh ? ' ' Very well, thank you, Mr. Woodford.' ' Your father well ?' ' Yes, thank you, Mr. Woodford.' ' What ! Sam, and Susie � Kate, and who's this gallant ? �cousin, eh ? Why, how spruce you all are ! They're going to remain to-night, of course, John.' 'O, yes, sir.' ' Your mother � is she ? ?' ' She's seeing their rooms got ready.' ' Any wine here ? � no, I suppose not. Go to Jim, and ask him to give you a bottle of port out of the store room. I saw him near the hazels as I came up the paddock.' ' O, no, sir ; Jim has gone down to Warrandilla for the letters. Mother decanted some wine an hour ago. Shall I fetch it?' ' Yes ; be careful, now � there's no light in the front room.' John, however, was not as careful as he might have been ; for, though he returned safely with the wine, he knocked something down in groping for the decanter. ' What was it that fell ?' ' Mother's desk. I put it up again all right. It wasn't injured.' Caleb filled out a glass of wine for himself, and about a quarter of a glassful each for the children. ' Now, my young friends, I'll give you a toast : here's long life and happiness to all of us ! ' The children raised their glasses as directed by Caleb, and were repeating the toast, but had only got 'as far as ' Here's long life � ' when Mrs. Woodford came into the room, and seeing John with the wineglass poised in his hand ready to drink, snatched it from him excitedly� a few drops of the wine, in her hurry, being dashed over little Mary Field, down whose pale' forehead they trickled like blood. 'No, no! no vine for you! Mistair Voodfordt, you must nevair gif dis boy vine ! promiss me you vill not ! It has been de ruin� alas ! de vorse dan ruin ot most of my familee, and it sail not be gifen to him ! Shon, iShon ! you must nevair touch it ! ' Caleb, at first surprised, as any one would bo under the circumstances, looked thoughtful for a moment or two, and then annoyed ; for no one held stricter notions in regard to indulging children in this manner than he did, and he could not. but deem his wife's speech and behaviour asaffected and absurd� as merely theatrical, in fact, calculated to show authority rather than maternal anxiety. Meantime, the others had drunk their wine with evident relish, and without interposition on the part of Mrs. Wood ford, who then led them to their rooms. Brooding over the scene, Caleb poured out another glass, of wine, and drunk it at a gulp. He was flushed and excited. He had been away several days ; he had, most of that time, been workinghard mustering stock beneath a scorch ing Bun ; he had been in danger of his life from the blacks, who had speared his horse under him ; and this was his reception on his return. This, after having solaced him Belf all along with the thought of � not certainly the warm tond welcome he could have wished, and his uniform kind ness deserved � but of, at any rate, a smiling place and a pleasant greeting. Instead of which, no look of affection no word of welcome ; looks and words only of reproach, and those even without a shadow of reason to sustain them. Caleb was no winebibber ; he had been brought up reli giously and temperately, and never until now had exceeded one glass, and that even he very seldom indulged in. Mechanically, however, he poured out another glassful and drank it. Feeling heated and tired, and disliking the glare ( of the lamp, he then went into the front room ; and, wheel i ing the couch before the windows, lay down upon it and j looked out. i a ^e 6aw ^e *u^ moon- swollen to an enormous size and i dusky-red, from the smokv haze of distant bush fires, rising I dow]y ,over Warrandilla. * The air was warm and still. He could hear the howling of the dingoes miles away on the mountains at the back of the homestead; and, nearer� inree miles down the road� the carousing of the shearers 

 and stockmen at Flanagan's grog shanty, an occasional oath, as it cut through the air like a knife, being the only part of the conversation which, he could fliRKngnfaii at that distance. For an hour or more he lay there looking out and think ing. Somehow, the events of the day and evening, and the calmness of the scene before him, made him for the first time reflect on his marriage. Did he love his wife? Had he been prudent in marrying her ? Was he happy ? These were questions that coursed hotly like lava streams through his mind, and remained unsettled. Recalled to more practical concerns by a light that he saw glimmering through the scrub already mentioned as lying on one side of the homestead, he muttered im patiently, ' Jim was right. We'll be eaten out of house and home in another year or two by these confounded selectors and diggers ! Why, that's not a mile away ! I'll close with Dawson, I think.' Dawson was a station-owner on the Murray, next to whom Caleb, quickened by the inroads of the selectors about Warrandilla, had, three years before, purchased a run. Here it was that lie had been the last few days. Before he left to return to Quondong, he had been chaffering with Dawson as to fresh stock ; and he was now about to write to him and accept his terms. Rising from the couch, he lit the lamp standing on the sideboard. For a moment the light dazzled his eyes, and prevented him from seeing a bundle of letters that had fallen from his wife's desk and lay scattered on the carpet. He soon Baw them, however, and hastened to pick them up and restore them to the desk, which had apparently burst open from the fall. Each letter he handled with the greatest care and tender ness, and endeavoured to replace it as neatly as the owner would have done. In this he did not succeed, as he dis covered in trying to close the desk ; so he drew all out again to see if, by a different arrangement, he could put them into a more compact space. What was this that stared him in the face, uncovered by the letters he drew forth ? He took it in his hands, sat down, drew the lamp towards him, and gazed fixedly and frowningly upon it. It was the miniature likeness of a dark-bearded, Italian featured man. His name, in bold flourishing handwriting, was written at the foot^' Giuseppe ? ' ; and on the back was an amatory couplet, in Italian, addressed to ' Car lotta.' Caleb ground his teeth when his eyes fell upon his wife's name. He pressed his hand upon his heart, which of a sudden had become like a hot coal in his breast. He alternately glared upon the likeness, with a maddening consciousness of his own physical inferiority, and turned to the other 6ide with the endeavour to make some meaning out of the love nonsense scribbled there ; but he did not know a word of Italian, and was led by jealousy to imagine a great deal more in the flimsy lines than they in reality expressed. His jealousy was rendered more acute by the frame of mind in which he had just previously been. ' There was some truth, after all,' r said he ' in the sneers of these d ? d Sydney cads !' That was the first oath Caleb had uttered for many a day. His reflections were bitter� painfully bitter, as he sat there by the table, with the lamp gleaming on his freckled sunburnt face, his hot brow resting on his hand, and throbbing beneath the fingers thrust so nervously through his hair; but he was doomed that evening to anguish far keener than any he had yet experienced. ' Father ! father !' It was his son's voice. Soon after he heard quick steps on the gravel in front of the verandah, and John burst into the room much excited and almost breathless. ?'What? Whatisit?'� ' Mother� there by the hazels � I was out posBuming with Bullocky, and we saw� that man � the foreigner� that came down the road with Jim� talking to mother, and trying to take her away with him ! ' ' Foreigner ! what foreigner ? ' said Caleb hoarsely. ' How do you know he's� he's� why dont you speak, boy ?' *' 'Cause we found two horses � one with a side-saddle� tied there by the stock-yard, and � ' ; but, suddenly catch ing a glimpse of the portrait which Caleb still held clasped nervously in his hand, John discontinued his speech, and burst out, ' That's the man, father ! that's the man ! ' Caleb clenched his teeth, but said nothing. He was a man of fervid feeling and strong passions ; and, during the lact few minutes, these had wrought a terrible change in his countenance, at the same time that they had almost bereft him of speech. He was flushed to an extreme degree ; his eyes were bloodshot and watery ; and the veins of his neck and forehead almost bursting. ' Come ! '' said he, casting the portrait on the table, and snatching up involuntarily a heavy riding whip he had thrown there earlier in the evening. Father and eon passed out of the room ; their footsteps sounded hollow for an instant crossing the verandah ; and then, crunching hurriedly over the gravel, their figures were lost in the smoky naze of the night and the shadow of the homestead. Mrs. Woodford and her tall swarthy lover � for such he had been years and years ago, and was now avowing himself still to be � stood beneath the hazels on the margin of the scrub in earnest conversation. They spoke in Italian. Regret and recrimination were the theme of their discourse for come time. He then pleaded and flattered, flattered and pleaded� sneering very judiciously now and then to add flavour to his wiles ; but apparently without avail, for the lady was obdurate, though seeming to hesitate. He spoke of Italy : her eyes flashed in the shadow like diamonds. He took her hand ; grew warmer and more imploring in his tones ; when suddenly the approaching footsteps of Caleb and his son fell on his ear, and with a harsh curse, he flew to his horse. He looked back when he had gone a few steps, as if medi tating whether be should take the lady with him by force ; but ne changed his mind, kissed his hand to her, cried ' Addio ! caro mio ! ' and rode away at a hand-gallop into the scrub. Caleb and John arrived in time to hear these words, and to see the horse and his rider vanishing into the gloom. Mrs. Woodford stood majestically in the moonlight, her dark eyes glistening scornfully, as Caleb, who came upon her suddenly, started back like one meeting a snake. Nothing was uttered on either side. Both read, or fancied they read, each other's thoughts ; and pride on tine one side, and rage � the terrible heart-consuming rage of a jealous and passionate man � on the other, rendered both silent. John looked on, endeavouring like a little man to to swallow the tears that were choking him ; but, why he could not tell, his eyes would fill, and everything to him looked bleared and indistinct. Husband and wife looked steadily at one another. Mrs. Woodford appeared so unabashed� her whole manner seemed so free from deceit, or the thought even of dishonour � that a wild hope fluttered for a moment at Caleb's heart ; could this strange man be her brother, or 6ome near relation, who had broken the law, and was flying from justice, and sought pecuniary assistance from her f She had spent enough of his money lately, Heaven knew ! to give some colour to the idea that she had been granting such aid. ' No� no,' he thought as suddenly, 'it cannot be; the hope is mad! ' Mad indeed it was ! but as a spark to be instantly quenched in the surging doubts and recollections that filled his mind. A burst of hearty careless laughter, evidently the climax to some humorous story, was now heard from the men's hut. How harshly it sounded to both of them ! With one impulse, Caleb and his wife walked toward* the homestead. Neither had as yet spoken. John had stolen away quietly a short while before ; am? had just lain down in bed crying his little heart out. Caleb walked into the room he had lately left, and Mrs. Woodford followed. Her eyes flashed vengefully when she saw her desk open� broken open by her husband, as she thought� and her letters and the likeness scattered on the table. The colour of her plump dark cheeks deepened to a poppy-red, and her lips quivered with suppressed passion. As for Caleb, he had grown very pale ; and the light of the lamp seeming to burn into his bloodshot eyes, he turned it down, almost out. Though the night was still oppressively close, and not a breath of air was stirring, he shivered as if cold. He certainly was deeply moved, and must have madly loyed the woman before him. Speaking in a low husky voice, he said, ' After what has happened to-night, you will see the neccssitv of our separating � at once.' Mrs. Woodford started as if stung. ' You will quit my house to-morrow morning� do not 

 nterrupt me! the dishonour you have brought upon me has left me no strength or inclination to bandy words with you. Woman! woman! had you no respect for your child, if not for yourself or me ? ' ' Dis-honair ! Bare, you are a cowardt ! vat proofs haf you do speak like dis?' ' Spare yourself, madam ; spare yourself ! your theatrical heroics have lost all power to move me ; I am thoroughly disillusionised! ' ' Ah ! you are a very cunning man. � genteelman, I should say � to break oppen your vife's desk, andt findt a great plod in a silly gairl's lofe ledders ! Dose are great proofs vor your insuldtB, Mistair Voodfordt ! ' ' Your desk was not broken open ; it burst open in fall ing. As for proofs, have you no shame to put on so bold a face after what occurred to-night? O! why did I no; hearken to what was notorious even before I married you ! ' ' 'Ah! you beliefed dose offisair fools dat sneered because dey vas repulsed. It is fake ! false, I zay ; andt you know it.' ' Believed them ! no, God help me! I did not; I attributed their assertions to envy at my success. Fool � fool� fool!' Mrs. Woodford, standing her full height, and glaring upon her husband, bit her lips till the blood came. From whatever cause � passion, probably� a tear at the same time rolled slowly down her cheek. ' I can lissen no longair to your insuldts. To-morrow I I vill not Btay till den!' Caleb's heart was burning within him ; his veins were on fire; and, though he was outwardly calm, -within, he was a prev to the most racking thoughts and the maddest rage. It was only by the strongest effort of will that ha had kept his passions under control ; and this had been the more difficult for him to do as his temperament was natu rally choleric, and he was little given to suppressing his emotions. Now, however, he rose in a perfect frenzy from the chair into which he had sunk on entering the room. He gathered the letters on the table hurriedly together, crammed them with the likeness into the desk, closed it, and, as his wife was leaving, called out loudly and coarsely to her, ' Here ! Go, then, if you will ! and take your d ? �1 letters with you ! ' at the 6ame time taking up the desk in. his hands and crashing it down at her feet, where it burst into fragments, the contents leaping out all over the carpet. The intensity of the passion that had supported him was now dissipated; he sank back exhausted in the chair, folded his arms on the table, and rested his aching head upon them. For many minutes Caleb sat in that position. The whisk of a dress went along the hall, and across the veran dah ; the dull thud of a horse' s hoofs sounded soon after � tho horse that bore bis wife down through the paddock and along the road beneath the dusky moon, never again to bo seen by him � but he Bat there silent and motionless. At length he raised his head. Though his face was again much flushed, and the veins of his temples were throbbing painfully, he appeared calmer. Turning up the lamp, he went to the escritoire; and, having examined some papers, drew thence the document which he sought. Sitting; down again to the table, he unfolded this document, and pon dered over it for some time. While he did this, the French windows, moved by a Blight breeze that had sprung up, opened slowly ; and the moon, now high above Warrara, peeped in through the rustling pasBion flowers, and shone upon his figure and some of the furniture of the room. He felt soothed in spirit, and prompted � he could not tell how the feeling arose� to read his Bible. Taking down the book from his place on the sideboard, he involuntarily opened it at the fly-leaf and read there � ' Presented to my dear son, Caleb, by Mb mother, in the fond hope that he will learn its truths, consult it in need or distress, and never neglect its daily perusal.' A host of loving recollections crowded into his mind as he read these words. His mother ! dead many years ago � how well he remembered the day she wrote these lines ! and the hymn he had repeated to her for this, her first, present � ' Abide with me ! Fast falls the even tide ; The darkness deepens� Lord ! with me abide.' With a choking sob, in relief of his overcharged feelings, he sank on his knees in the moonlight, and prayed fer vently. * * * * * What a scorcher the morning is ! Look at Bullocky there ! what a labour the black scamp is making of nailing those opossum skins to that gum-tree, whisking thefliea every now and then from his face with a sapling branch. There are Jim and Black Dan coming up the back paddock after having watered the horses. How lazily they walk ! How they sweat ! and how they swear, Jim especially, at the host of grasshoppers that fly up in their faces as they walk along ! Away back they can see the ranges all smoking with bush fires. Should the slight breeze that is blowing shift to that quarter, it will, they eay in their minds, not only bring down with it suffocating blasts of smoke, but endanger the whole country around Warrandilla, scrubby as it is and parched up with the almost continuous drought. The sky is cloud less, and every few minutes is filled with passing flocks of parrots and cockatoos flying eastward from the burning ranges. It is early yet ; the sun has been up only an hour or two ; but neither Caleb Woodford, nor John, both early risers, have yet made their appearance. Billy, the cowboy, who is driving out the dairy cows, and is generally accompanied by John and the two dogs, looks about and listens for the usual ' Hi I Jason ! tear him, boy ! ' of his young master, but is disappointed. Rover and his consort are stretched lazily in the shade of the store room ; and, though Sam and Susie and the other youngsters are up and away an hour ago or more� have already, in fact, delightedly got off their good clothes, and, as Billy can see, are all at the present moment down at the creek splashing; about to their heart's content � John, who has spent a rest less night, is just rubbing bis eyes preparatory to rising. Dressing himself, he recalls the events of the evening ; and, though in his dreams � dreams so vivid as to appear reality-� he fancied he and his father gave chase through the scrub to the ' foreigner,' eventually overtook him, and having given him a sound whipping with a raw bullock hide bridle, tied him up with it to a sapling and left him. He feels an oppression upon him he cannot shake off. John is but a boy � is only in his tenth year ; yet, how differently constituted he is from others of his age may be seen from his tone of thought, and the fervour of his feel ing. He is wild, headstrong, and proud ; but loves his mother with such depth of affection that anything which distresses her doubly wounds him ; and he feels cut to the heart when he thinks of the part he took in the events of the previous evening. He does not yet know that she is gone ; but he is a boy of quick thought and penetration, and he is soon assisted to that knowledge. Feeling something dangling about his throat, he puts up his hand and finds it to be a little locket containing a miniature likeness of his mother, attached to his neck by a piece of blue ribbon. How did it come there? He sat down on his little bed, feeling suddenly quite cold in the face. Starting up, he ran out hurriedly into the hall, calling out in a hesitating voice, 'Mother! mother!' There was no reply, nor was there any movement about the house ; and a great lump arose in his throat as he pushed open her bedroom door and found the place emntv. 'Father!' F ** He went down the hall, opened the parlour door, and looked in. The carpet was all littered with papers, and with the fragments of his mother's desk. Caleb was sitting down, with his arms folded on the table, and his forehead resting upon them. He was evidently asleep, and had been for some hours, so John thought, for the lamp was still burn ing. An open Bible lay on the table on one side of him, and on the other an unfolded deed � his will. He held a pen in his hand, and had fallen asleep over what he had been writing ; for, as John looked over his shoulder, he read hese few words, all that had been written, on a sheet of 1 aper lying on the tabte � ' I, Caleb Woodford, being of sound mind and body, hereby revoke � ' The place was very still. The windows were open, and the room was full of flics, which were buzzing about and occasionally bobbing against the glass. The sun was shin ing fiercely in, and dazzled the eye as it beat against tho lustres and mirror on the uiantlepiece, rand from them against the opposite wall upon an engraving of the Pursuit oi Pleasure hanging there and shining down upon Caleb. ' Father ! ' How hot the wind was as it kept puffing in through the 

 windows ! John stepped over and drew the cnrtains, hasp ing the windows at the same time. 'Father! father!' John shook him by the shoulder ; and then took hold of his hand to draw it from under his head. He startled back, trembling ; it was as cold as an icicle. Cabel Woodford was asleep indeed ; he was dead. Chapter II. ' Venator : Sir, we are all so happy as to have a fine, freehi cool morning, and I hope we shall each be the happier in the other's company.' � Tlie Complete Angler. It is a lovely spring afternoon in the year 187 � . The eky is clear and blue, the air fresh and exhilarating, and all the country about Warrandilla as green as emerald. Mount Samic&on, the Sheepshanks, the Nobbys, all the hills for twenty miles around stand out distinctly against the smiling sky ; and on the ranges in die far distance can be seen white streaks of light, denoting to the experienced eye that the sun is shining on countless trunks of dead timber, and (hat, -when seen so plainly, the weather will be likely to continue fine. Great changes have taken place in and around Warran dilla these latt few years. There are now no diggers about ; though some hundreds of them are massed about twenty miles down the Omeo road, whither they have followed the creek ; but the whole place is inundated with solcctore. There is hardly an available acre that 16 not taken up. All the Quondong run, with the exception of a few thousand acres of purchased land, is pegged out, and 11ns rich downs on which Caleb Woodford pastured his sheep are now for many a mile fenced in and under crop, or used for grazing and breeding horses for India. The township has naturally grown very much larger. It possesses two mills, two churches, and no fewer than eleven public-houses. The Church of England^ a most imposing edifice, and has a very tall, sharp spirej which catches the rays of the morning sun next after Mount Jamison and the homestead at Quondong, and minutes before any roof or chimney in Warrandilk. It was erected, after an excep tionally good wheat season, by Mr. Johnson, one of the mill-owners, and was referred to at the time by the War~ randiUa Standard, one of the two local papers, as ' a noble addition to the church architecture of the southern hemi sphere.' It has, consequently, an air of great haughtiness, and no doubt considers itself very much superior to its surroundings. From -hc verandah at Quondong, whore years ago Mrs. Woodford stood and received her son after his ride from Warrara, the country looks much less wooded than it did when she surveyed it. Trees that have not been felled or grubbed, are, with very few exceptions dead and blackened from bush fires, or ringed ready for grubbing. To the right, however, stall stretch the impenetrable mazes of the hazel scrub, not yet encroached upon by the selector, save slightly at one place where the undergrowth is not so dense. But to the left the view is almost unimpeded by growing timber of any kind. The space between Quondong and Dr. Field's, and away back for many miles, is crossed and subdivided by dog-leg and brush fences, and dotted here and there with selectors' huts. This is the richest part of the country, and looks very green and picturesque beneath the mild afternoon sun. Dr. Field's house, Mill View, is situated on a slight eminence in the midst of a well-kept garden and orchard. It is not so spacious as Quondong, but it is far prettier, and its deep verandah surrounded by creepers, gives it a very airy and pleasant appearance. Here John Woodford has spent a good portion of his school holidays, during the last twelve years. Dr. Field, whom Caleb had constituted his executor, has given John a good sound education. He sent him, in the first place, to one of the colleges in Melbourne, where he studied hard and successfully. From his college he went to the University, where, how ever, from indifference rather than from want of talent, he loitered away a good deal of his time, and, at first, made no figure. But, at length, he bent himself to his tasks, and took his degree with first-class honours. Thie afternoon he had returned home. Standing in tho drawing-room at Mill View, with his elbow resting care lessly on the mantelpiece, and speaking with easy self possession to Mrs. or Miss Wilson, to Dr. Field, or to herself, Mary Field thinks him a splendid fellow. But he was always her hero. He is of a broad-chested athletic build, is over six feet in height, and swarthy almost as a Hindoo. His eyes arc large, and of a singularly pole gray. They ars particularly notice able as ill-assorting strangely with his cloudy, nervous face � the contrast being rendered more remarkable by the thin, crisp, black beard and moustache which he cultivates. His nose 16 large, and has a barely perceptible Jewish cast, which gives his smile a somewhat supercilious air. His lips arc thin, and, when he is not speaking, seemingly com pressed ; his mouth, therefore, appears to indicate a great deal moro firmness and decision than he in reality pos sesses. Great determination and great weakness are in .fact expressed by h'is countenance, cither of which he might exhibit according as the mood seized him. ' So you are determined not to give me a day's rest after my haid studying and hard riding, Mrs. Wilson ? ' ' Well, well � O, you men ! Do you hear him, doctor ? and the Fcamp all the time as delighted as can be that I should suggest the pic-nic ! ' 'O! ma. your bow! ' murmured Miss Wilson, putting up her bauds' to her mother's scarf and tying it straight. ' Thank you, my dear ! Now, doctor, will you, once for a'l, put down that Graphic, and join in our consultation � it's a long time since you took part in anything of the kind, you know ! ' (laughing). �- Ton my soul ! that s a lancet thrust, if you like !' ' Yes, pa ; you can't resist that ! ' 'O! well,' have your own way!' laying down the Graphic, and taking off his glasses*. 'Fanny, Fanny, my dear!' whispered Mrs. Wilson, ' do hold'yourself straight ! ' t( Well, I do, ma ; I was only looking at the bottom flounce ol your dress. Do you know, I really believe ? ' ' John, you'll of course take the women wherever they want to betaken to. I can't be expected to go gallivanting round the country at my time of life ; so don't expect me to join the party.' ' Well, there's a prosaic speech ! and there's politeness ! O! Chesterfield ! ' 'Chesterfield be hanged, ma'am! There's nothing like being plain spoken ! ' ' Yes. sir; I shall be happy to escort the ladies wherever they wish. But where? 1 don't know a suitable spotabout Ihe country ?where we are not forestalled by selectors.' ' Why not Warrarra?' suggested Mary. ' Warrarra ! that dreary hole ? ' ' ' O ! I know ! 1 know ! I know ! ' cricl Miss Wilson, excitedly, ' the hazel scrub !' ' Lovely ! delightful ! ' said her mother, ' It will be so like mystery making our way into its dark recesses. And I do love mystery ! What do you 6ay, Mary ? ' ' Yes ; there must be some pretty spots in there ? ' ' ' Pretty spots ! ' I wonder at you ! You're as prosaic as your father ! Child, when I 'was your age I was all romance and poetry. J should have been picturing Mr. Woodford as Lord Mortimer ! ' 'Ha! ha! ha! you flatter me, Mrs. Wilson! and who would be Amanda r ' 'Amanda? let me 6ee; which of your girls is fur? Fanny, of course !' 'O, ma!' ' Tut, tut, tut,' said Dr. Field, ' will you people talk �3enEe, or shall I go out into the garden and leave you to SoVerise'r' ' Perhaps, sir, we'd better all go. It's a pity to be in a day like this.'' �*? Yes, yes : better out. Miss Wilson, will you take my arm?' ' Doctor, I'm ashamed of you,' bridled up Mrs. Wilson, w and voung men about ! Ill take your arm.'' ?' O.' very well � come along then,' and the pudgy, choleric, little doctor, with thin, bustling, romantic, Mrs. Wilson hooked on to his arm, marched out, followed by John and the two girls. Miss Wilson was a tall flaxen-haired girl, with light eyes, and regular and verv pretty features. She was flighty, fomewhat empty-headed, but good-hearted and affectionate. Her mother, the widow of a very wealthy squatter � a man who had sold out of his station on the Darling two years previously at a good figure, but finding that had he waited another year, he could have got double the price, grew very gloomy, 'took to his bed, and, it is averred, died of epleen� had, by her foolish conversation, and the class of books she gave her daughter to read, done her best unintentionally to 

 wader har morenonseMical than she naturally waa. Bu ene was very attractive, had BparJcUng eyes, and a pleasant Sfc '*i wl'� d* became ianold maid, as she archly SSSSft?1?0*!?*1*'1' ?*�- going to be very eensibte and read the leading articles. Jrom tiie first moment that MiRsWOaon had seen John �oocuord, twelve month* previously, she had mentally in vested his dark commanding figure with the roseate hoe of romance-**eeling which her mother, who considered him the beauukal of a hero, did much indirectly to foster. Continued intercourse had gradually deepened this feeling to one of a wanner nature; and it was now plain that ahe cnemned an attachment for him stronger than mere friend John had done nothing directly to provoke this feeling. He had observed it, however, but with the greatest indifiV ence; for, having no desires of the kind himself, neither for her nor for anyone else, he was inclined to smile at Buch folly. Besides, guaging her mind as he did, he deemed her apparent affection for him a mere fancy, and worthy therefore of little consideration. He was probably right. �c' ��1 h�veveh did not view this romantic liking of Miss \\\\ ilson b with equal carelessness, or indifference. Dr. * leld could hardly conceal his displeasure ; and John could see, and smile at, his various little manoeuvres to prevent Miss W llson and him from being too frequently together. � hy was this ? The mitch would Burely be a good one in a worldly point of view� the light in which the doctor considered such things : and he, as John's guardian, should be delighted at the prospect of his marriage with so much wealth. The doctor, however, had very good reasons for thinking otherwise. He had a daughter himself; he was not over rich ; and the management of John's property, and the handling of John's money these many years, had long ago filled him with tlie desire of not letting' either pasB away from the family. The doctor was blunt, splenetic, and self-seeking, but had no finesse. His designs, therefore, were soon apparent to John, whose friendship for Mary � and from a bov he was always very fond of her, and she of him� grew much cooler in consequence. Mary was surprised and grieved when she observed this and could not imagine to what it might be owing. She did not, as others in her position might have done, attribute it to any attachment on John's part for her friend Fanny ? for, although she saw that Miss Wilson had an evident liking for him, she also saw that he was at no pains to con ceal that he was far from being similarly disposed towards her. Mary was sensible, as well as good and bright-looking, and she soon shook off the d ull feeling of oppression which John's coolness had given her, and went about her house hold duties with the same pleasant smile on her brown face, and the same sparkle in her brown eyes, as before. One thing she had discovered by John's change of manner, and that was, that, although she had always known that she liked him very much, she had never thought that her affec tion for him was so strong as her feelings rendered evident when she first observed his coolness towards her. John was a strange moody fellow at times, so she thought, at last ; and she soon got to think that his coolness was more apparent than real. At any rate, she looked very happy and contented lean ing on his muscular arm, and glancing up occasionf lly in his face when he spoke, as he escorted her and Miss Wilson around the garden that cool sunny afternoon. How rich and sonorous his voice was. She delighted to listen to it, it seemed so calm and full of courage. ' Do you remember when we used to romp about here in i the dusk. Mary, � plaving hide and go seek Y' ' My !' said Miss Wilson, ' Ah ! now you're jesting.' ' That was when we were very young. Miss Wilson � ten years ago.' ' Yes, I remember. What fun we used to have ! Ahj but do you remember wilfully trampling over my little garden one evening when you could'nt find me, and I would'nt appear when you called P See ! there's where the plot was.' ' Yes, I behaved disgracefully,� it was on the anniver sary of your tenth birthday, too, I recollect. But, come now ! 1 made amends afterwards, didn't I F' '.' Oh, how V � how, Mary V Do tell me how he made amends! What did he do? What?' John smiled at her impulsiveness. ' Why, by bringing better from Melbourne, Fanny ; for which I was very; very much obliged to him.' John was very kind and pleasant that afternoon ; and Mary remembered the day long afterwards, as one of the happiest she had ever spent. Walking slowly about, stopping occasionally to admire a flower, or to interchange their botanical knowledge, the time went rapidly by. John, who was as joyous and as full of animal spirits as a schoolboy, told them no end of suspiciously exaggerated stories of blacks, dingoes, kangaroos, and sun-downers � being a portion of his experiences while on a visit last year to his station on the Murray ; and wound up by giving them a startlingly lifelike imitation of the cry of eonie magpies that were chattering1 in the adjacent paddock. Marv's face seemed all dimples. Miss Wilson fluttered about like a bird, asked twenty questions, in a breath � answering half of them herself, and doubting the answers she got to the remainder � laughed at everything, and clapped her hands in frantic enjoyment at the imitation of the magpies. ' My ! where are mamma and the doctor all this time ? ' said 6ne. ' How ma' would like to hear you ! I suppose they have gone for a long walk.' Not they, indeed. In fact they had taken but an extremely short one � as far only a6 the orchard ; on reaching which, Mrs. Wilson, in a lackadaisical manner, requested the doctor to ' fever ' her by climbing a certain tree and pluck ing a spray of blossom ! The doctor halted suddenly, and drew himself up like a soldier on parade, frowning Medusa-like upon her. ' What ! what madam ! are you mad ? climb that tree ! I could'nt do it to save my life, and most certainly not with out bursting my breeches ! ' Saying which he turned on his heel and made for the house, leaving Mrs. Wilson transfixed with his vulgar out spokeness and want of gallantry . As for himself, he muttered as he went along, ' Damme ! the woman's a fool! ' concluding by saying, as he entered the door, ' Laughing- jackasses � both of 'eui, mother and daughter'' Whereupon he threw himself into his easy chair, and went to steep. Mrs. Wilson soon bobbed after the him into house, where she soothed her ruffled feelings by taking up, for the hundredth time, the Mysteries of Udolpho and dozing over it till tea was ready. It was now dusk; and John, with Mary and Miss Wilson, came slowly up the garden towards home. ' I think we shall find both your parents in the house,' said John ; ' I don't think either cares for much walking.' ' Papa doesn't, I'm sure.' ' O ! Mr. Woodford, how is it you never speak of your parents? I knew there was something I wanted to ask you. Where are they ? Have you any?' There was no sound fora minute but that of their tread as they walked along the path. Mary, as she leant on John,' felt her wrist pressed suddenly hard against his side. She felt for his position, and her face burned at the thoughtlessness of her friend's questions. 'Come, Fanny' said she, with forced gaiety, 'let us run ahead and see how tea is getting on.' ' No� no-^-no ! now � really � ' ' Miss Wilson,' 6aid John in low curt tones, ' the subject is distasteful to me. Pray, do not mention it again.' 'What a change had fallen on them all so suddenly ! Mary was silent and ill at ease ; John morose ; and Fanny ready to cry with vexation and sensitiveness at the dis pleasure she had unintentionally caused him. Thus thev passed into the house.
