 CHAPTER V.- HOLDING UP THE . CAMEL TEAM. 

 As soon as Dave got clear of prison he ?was led into the bush by one of the sun tlowner's confederates, a thorough busu rascal, .who acted as a kind of scout for any . cattle 'thief' or bushranger whom he might happen to come in contact with. This scamp would not rob banks himself, becaust of the .risks . attached to such doings; he would not 'work for an honest living, be cause he said. -he had been born tired. He loafed through hfe drifting from one tmyn ehip to another, a' jackal for bolder spirits. 

 jjave . ioiiowca wnere . ine uiau ieu. be cause he knew that it was to the scamp's interest to help him. He had made up bis mind in his quiet ?way to become a knight of the road. He could not clear himself of the charge or shooting Vernon without convicting Ken, and that hfe would not, do. t . He wrote me a letter expalining his planF, which' lie had conveyed to me by the fellow who acted as his guide when lie made his escape. . 'Vernon means to make me a convict,' he wrote. - 'He will get me in the chain gang somehow, and once there it will not �e long' before he will get me flogged. He ' has schemed for this for years, so I have no choice. I must turn outlaw, but, dear Kate, I will be a gentleman of the road, not a bush blackguard.' He was soon brought in touch with Bryan and father, and he was then intro duced to Basil McAllister. Almost at -once the gang set to work on the roads. One thing Dave planned was the talk of the whole counti-yside, because of the touch of romance attached to it.. It came to the knowledge of tbe~ gang that an Afghan merchant named Mahomet had ruined a white teamster and con tractor named Perkins, and had openly boasted that he would dp the same by any Europeans who did not give way to him. Perkins had been in the habit of carry ing stores to outlying townships and sta tions by means of waggons. He had started m a very humble way. and had be come well-to-do. He was a good master to his men and paid all his teamsters tip top wages.- Besides taking food-stuffs into the interior. Perkins used to convey the wool and hides from the stations to the townships or depots and was considered on all sides as one of the best men in the country. Mahomet, the Afghan merchant, tried to purchase this carrying business from Perkins at an absurdly low price,- and when Perkins refused -to sell Mahomet imported a hundred camels and a lot of cheap Afghan drivers, and at once set to work to ruin poor Perkins. 

 lie carried goods to the back country and brought wool back for almost nothing, and kept this up until Perkins was absolutely beggared; and then, when the white man ?was ruined, the wily Afghan raised the prices again, and was coining money. It came to the ears of the gang that Mahomet himself was going inland with something like several thousand pounds in cash to buy up cattle from the small selectors. It was his practice to buy cheap and pay cash, and then herd the little mobs of cattle into one big drove and send them to the big cities. It was Dave's scheme to stick Mahomet and his escort up and ease him of his cash, and then start Perkins in bunisess again. Father laughed when he heard of the plan. 'Why, boy,' said he, 'yon mean fo play nineteenth-century Robin Hood, do I you?' 'I mean to give this wealthy Asiatic bounder a taste of bush -justice,' answered Dave. 'It will be good policy, too, father, for all who are in any kind of trouble will then become our friends.' 'All the Afghans carry rifler and know how to use them,' put in Bryan. 'All the better,''' cried Dave cheerily. 'We are four bushmen, and the Afghans are a dozen strong.' It will make a good light, and folks will know that'rie Killowea gang are not afraid to meet armed men. in a stand-up struggle.-' ? 'It* will bring Vernon and his black pack about our eai-s,' interjected Basil Mc Allister. At that father leapt to his feet, crying, 'I hope to Heaven it will; for if Vernon does not soon come to me, I shall go to him. He has lived too long as it is. We'll stick up Mahomet, if you think, Dave, that it will oriug us to grips with Vernon.' So it was arranged, and the four of them rode to Jarlee Downs, where they knew the Afghans would have to pass. - j ' It was full noon when they saw the ] camel team heavily laden with tea and flour, sugar, salt^ and tobacco, come wind ing across the downs. At. a' signal from father the gang galloped from the cover of a patch of wattle-trees, where they had been hiding, and riding to four different parts of the long camel train, commanded the Afghans to bail-up.' '� ..Mahomet answered by firing his revolver fair at Bryan's head, but his camel lurched at the critical moment, and the lad only got a flesh wound in the face, which left [ an ugjy.eear. In.. a moment revolvers were cracking and spitting spitefully all along the ' line, lor/ the Afghans were very plucky. . \\ 7'' 'Father's left arm was soon' dangling from his side, broken by. a bullet just above the ' elbow ; but he only smiled grimly and kept 'on shooting. '_?'.- Uasil McAllister .was in his element' amid 'Such 'a wild scene;, he shouted and sang as be fought; and at last the Afghans called for a parley, and after some wrangling they surrendered, and the gang took the money tha^ Mahomet had hidden between the pads or his camel saddle.; When he handed it to Bryan he- spat''1and cursed, and called the garuj-a set of infidel dogs. ?;??/ He was so savage that his hair bristled: like the hair oh a dog's back, and he shook his fist in the faces of.^the outlaws anA swore. that he would- have vengeance 'for 4b% loss'of his inoney,' -; ? = . .' - ''.^ -/'All ..right.' old: whisker?,' :^ried .^Basll' cheerily. ; 'You can start in and get youj:: vengeance as �bon as. you pleasev; It's -part 'of the. game, ybu know';' 'and. lie laiighefl as he caught, a | camel by its nose-line and ? made the beast' kneel, down. . - . ?., ': : ???

' ^ ? ? ' '?.':^'-'.'-. 

 what pleased his fancy, and carried his own load packed on nis sutdle: *nd all (lie lime Mahomet stood near, calling ilium nanws that he thought would lit thorn, and mix ing this up with horrible cursing. No one took any notice of -him, however, and at last the gang rode away. A splitter was found not far off in the bush, who volunteered to go and bring a doctor out of Midarmee township to patch up the wounded. When this was done, Dave rode at night to the home of Perkins the contractor, and siltmg loosely in the saddle he knocked at the door with the butt of his pistol. Per kins came instantly, and'Dave tossed him a hag full of gold. * 'Who's this from?.' demanded Perkins; 'and what is it for?' 'Never mind who it is from, Mr. Perkins,' cried Dave cheerily; 'you make good use of it,' and touching his horse -with the spur, he disappeared into the night. Of course this soon became known: At any rate everyone knew that Perkins wa/ penniless just before the camel team was stuck up, and folks soon noticed that he had plenty of ready cash to carry on business with immediately afterwards. Besides, Perkins dropped a fevr very broad hints about 'bush justice,' whicli set folks talking and the .Killowen gang was soon quoted all over the place as the champions of the poor against the rich. ? Whilst fathers arm was mending, Dave acted as captain of the gang; and during that time -he. made many friends by helping needy people with monex There was one poor family' named Brown to whom he was especially kind at that period. They had lost nearly all that tliey possessed in the world through a bush fire, which lulled off their stock, and destroved their fences, out-houses, stables; and all else that would burn, and they were suffering abject want. Dave and his comrades called at the Browns' house one night', and opening the front door tossed a big roll of notes into the room and rode away; and that night they galloped their horses forty-five miJes, and at nine o'clock next morning they stuck up a, branch of the Bank of Victoria,' and got safely away with twelve hundred pounds. Two days after the sticking up of the bank the whole 'country was norrified to hear_ of a terrible murder committed just outside Betaloo. The wife of a poor se lector, who was little more than a girl, was found done to death. ' : The police at once blamed the- Killowen gang, tltough they had riot an atom* of evi dence to cojnnect .them with the crime. Placards -containing an offer of two. bun-: dred pounds for each of -the outlaws, dead or alive, were stuck up all 'over the. place and a keen hunt was organised; but a great many folk, both men and women, refused, to credit the Killowens with the crime. Police traps were set for thein in all di rections, but warnings came to them from all kinds and conditions of people; for there were many respectable, honest folk who considered that the Killowens had been,, driven to a lawless life by Vernon. Dave made up his mind to try and find out who had killed the selector's wife, and soon got hold of evidence which convinced him that the crime had been committed by an Italian who was out on 'ticket.' This fellow was a smith by trade and had a little shop with a blacksmith's forge not f;v fj^i-i the scene of the crime. So Dave disguised himself, aud leaving his horse with Bryan, he tramped, with a su-.ig on his back, to the smith's forge and j asked for work. i He had always been handy at shoeing ' horses and that kind of work. The smith, who was a big, powerful, bony man, .with a vicious face, eyed the strapping young fel low keenly and'asked him many questions; but at last lie engaged him, and . Dave stripped off his coat and went about his work. ? ' ' j He had to act as 'striker' for the smith and do all the rougher work; and he found his employer a hard taskmaster and a foul mouthed brute to deal with. Yet Dave did what came his way to dp cheerfully enough, for he was naturally industrious, and. a day's work never came amiss to him. One day when lie was busy at the forge, half a dozen police troopers clattered up i and demanded of the smith that he should j lay everything else aside on the instant and examine their horses' hoofs. They made no secret of their mission. They were out in search of the Killowens. and were keen to get the reward offered for the outlaws, dead or alive. ' It amu-ed Dave very much to hear himself described by the troopers. ' ' - ' ? 'I'll give him all he wants if I get within rifle range of him,' cried one of the troopers. 'I'll shoot him on sight and get his scalp money.' He was a particularly | boastful fellow, and to hear him talk a stranger might ' have been excused # for thinking that shooting bushrangers single handed was a very common performance for him. . . The .whole lot of them sat about, and smoked, and talked over'th;eir plans for the capture of the Killowens in a particularly reckless fashion. They were a city, draft, and did not know, apparently that half the ? folks inthe district were in.synipathy. .with I -tbe-'koxig. . ?'?..'.'..?,??..? '?' ? ''. ' '] : When- they had. gone the 'smith, said 4o\\ Dave, 'I wish I could get qixjk.be track of, the Killowens;- I!d earn 'iT nice bit of money.' ..-',. ' . ! 'How?' demanded Dave. 'Oil, easy enough. I'd pretend to work with them and sell them to the police.' 'Take their -juouey as a kind ..of 'scout ! for them and- then betray them; 'is that wliaT you mean?' queried Dave.' .' . . 'That's about' it. I want money. Ijnean to feet away from here.' ?'?'-. . 'Bo do, I,' answered Dave. 'I can't stand this place.' . ' : '?' ? , 'Why not?' cried the smith. -. : 'i3h. well, I don't mind telling .you, 76* I've got the creeps.

'Someone has tricked you, you fool!' screamed the Italian. See ' here,' he added, drawing a knife from Iris belt; 'I'll put this into the man,- or wonian either, who; tries to . frighten me with such mummery.' ? ? 'Why should anyone try' to frightefc you?'. was Dave's nest question. 'Oh,-it's someone who thinks I had a hand in the murder of the selector's wife,'.'j I blurted out the m^n savagely; 'but I did not, and I don't want any ghost business about here. If you see it again, put a bullet into it.' . - ?? I But Dave shook' his head. 'I know a ' ! living ..woman when. I see one,' said he, 'and that 'was no live creature. Why, I got up and looked on the ground for tracua, i and there were no tracks there/'-y I Then the Italian behaved like a mad I i creature. He tossed iip bis arms and raved j I and cursed, - until Dave was glad to walk away to avoid hearing him, and as he I walked he muttered to himself-r 'If that chap hasn't got a guilty con ' science he looks and acts most uncommonly as if he had.' Twenty times that day the smith returned to' the subject. He talked of nothing else, and when night came he ! made some excuse in order that Dave should walk home with him. Dave was a bit put out by this, because he had an appointment with one of big scouts, who acted as a messenger between him and the gang. Still, he managed later to get a message away, and he was able to tell Bryan a good deal concerning the plans of the police, thanks to the talkative ness of the troopers who had visited the forge that day. , A few days passed uneventfully,., and then a trooper came with a horse he wanted shod, and from him Dave gleaned that Inspector Veiuon and the black trackers were organising a grand hunt for the Kill owen band.- ' 'You'll be pretty busy, young fellow, remarked the trooper, for the horses will all need to be shod well, as we have a lot of rough country to ride over.' 'If you had told me that you expected to ride over hilly country,' said Dave in nocently, 'I'd have put barred shoes on your horse. Plain shoes slip on rocky ground.' ~ . 'I know they do,' grunted the trooper: 'and we've rocks enough to ride amongst shortly, after those infernal Killowens. ' ' Thus innocent Dave knew that Vernon was going to scour the hills where the caves were, ? and very probably he would find the camp where father was resting with -his broken ariii. That night Dave got out by his bedroom window, and, stealing away into the bush, he tramped until he got to a place where he was sure of having a horse found for him; and then he rode, like the beautiful bushmau he was, to warn the camp, and father and the others at-^nce made off to a fresh, hiding-place, leaving Vernon and his human ? blood-hounds to search, vainly for them. Dave went back to; his work as he had. left it, riding': and tramping. It was just dawn when he got in through the window and he peeped at the Italian, who was sleeping. in another room. The fellow was tossing from ? side to side and muttering in his sleep. It .entered into Dave's head to give the villain a fright, so, putting his hands to his mouth, he uttered a piercing shriek and fled to his own room and sat down on the bed. In a moment the Italian came bursting in, his face-ghastly white,- and; his eyes wild with terror. 'Wiat is it?' he demanded. 'I - don't know,' cried Dave, with a shudder. 'I heard awful screams, a woman's, screams. Didn't you hear it?' 'I heard someone scream,'' answered the fellow. 'I� I thought it was you- dream ing-' 'I wasn't dreaming,' replied Dave, 'and that cry was not human. I tell you this place is haunted and I'm going to leave it. You can stay here by yourself, if you wanr to. I wouldn't sleep here for a thousand a year.' He rose and went towards the door. The Italian followed him and stood shaking with superstitious dread under a gum-tree close by. - ? ? When it was fully light Dave packed up his' few things and demanded his wages. He knew that he would have to leave the blacksmith, because Vernon might call with his horses any .Jay, and his keen eyes might detect Dave even through his excellent dis guise. When he had gone about a mile from the forge some instinct impelled J)ave to turn back and watch the smith. For this pur pose he approached the forge from behind, walking lightly amongst the heavy timber.. | He had nearly got to the edge of . the wood, when he came across fresh tracks go ing towards some rugged hills about half a mile distant. He knew at a glance that the tmijks had been made by the smith because of the length of his feet. - . 'I wonder what has taken him up., there on a weekday.' thought Dave. ''I'll find out, anyway; and he followed the tracks . until he came, upon the blacksmith, who was kneeling down by a wombat hole. A bit of dry bark -crackled under Dave's foot. The smith sprang 'up ? and looked wildly : about him. ? His pistol was in one haiid, a long, crnel looking knife in the other. He. was within '. a couple of feet of the edge of a oliff. I Dave put his hands to his mouth as th-- blaoks do when they want to make a shrill call, and then, thinning his voice until.it, was Jike a woman's he uttered a shriek that rang agam; from the cKffs. It -sounde.d weird, and uncanny in such a spot. ?- The Italian uttered a wild cry of affright, stepped- back apace, and went headlong over the precipice, and Dave heard^ him thud on the rocks below. He looked! cautiously over and saw the fellow lying ;, wry still, in .a crumpled:up condition, fifty ; feet below. ','? . Then Daye went to. the wombat hple, and thrusting in his- 'arm he . drew out I several articles of cheap jewellery� a watchJ a gold : ring 'with , aji 'imitation diamond in ] it- a pair of-- earrings; an'd one, or two other ' things of a like'.sort: 'and'he knew from the ] lpok,-of ?them^fchat,;tbey 'jniist- have-belonged toHbe' poor, murdered woman,' whose blood' Daye knew was' oh the' hands and the soul of ithe. villain 'who 'had met ^his fate ia'few jnWents earlier ihrbugh his own . giulty fears.- As Dam -yas.i,b'alancinK.1l'he cheap jew�lle'iy/% hiB^hdnd, he -suddenly he.ard 'a. voice cry� ' . . .-'?. . . 1 'Bail'lip.pr I shoot!'

What for 3-ou call out that way, eh?' , But Dave did not answer him.. He was too downhearted to talk, for he had a feel ing that Vernon would take good care oi him this time, and would not rest until he got him safely hanged for highway robbery with violence. . . _ The . black was marching him along and jeering him 'all the time, when Dave saw a white man step from behind a tree a few dozen yards away to the right of him. He knew him at a glanccfor one Of a party of splitters who were working in the neighbor hood. All of those fellows were friendly to the Killowen gang because they had been well bribed; and they hated all policemen, be cause they looked upon them as natural enemies. But most of all they hated a black policeman, for it was the blacks who tracked them down wnen they did any wrong thing. Dave walked On with a beating heart, wondering if the splitter would dare attempt a rescue. The black had heen watching his prisoner, so closely that he did not see the man lurking in the scrub. Sud denly a. pistol-shot rang out, the black gave a gasping sort of cry and fell backwards, dis charging one barrel of his gun as he did 60. Dave gave just one glance at the fallen black, and then ran as fast as his feet would let him into the scrub. 'You owe me a good one for this day's work,' Baid the splitter grimly 'You'd have gone _to the end of a rope if I had not saved you. Here,' he continued, pushing the revolver. into Dave's hand, 'take thin. It saved your life, man, and I don't want to' be found with that thing on me when Vernon comes and overhauls our 'camp, as he is pretty certain to do. How did you come to let that black dingp catch you?' Dave told him. The man whistled. 'So it was none of the Killowen gang who did that murder, eh?' 'No; we are not that -sort.' 'I didn't think you were, but Vernon has saddled your gang with the crime in order to rouse the feelings of the people against you. Now you'd , better be off. Ira going. Good-bye, and good luck.' He went his way. and Dave stood and did some very rapid thinking, and in the end decided to go back to the forge and com mence work there as usual, because that was his beet phance of getting a really good horse quickly. He had scarcely got his forge fire alight ere he heard the sounds of hoofs, and there, on a fine grey horse, sat that very trooper who hadTboasted so loudly that he would kill any Killowen lie might meet on sight - . i 'Where's you master, young man?' de manded this autocrat.' _ j 'He's away on business of hia own some where,' answered Dave. .. | The trooper swung his long length out of j the saddle,. and hitching up his horse came ! to the forge to light his pipe. 'Got, that Killowen gang yet?' queried Dave. . ^ 'Not yet, but we'll soon have 'cm; Vernon has pressed a lot of Afghans into the service for a week. The Killowens once stuck the Afghans' camel .team up and robbed 'em, and they are itching to get even with the marauders. The old chan who leads .'em swears he'll flay 'em alive if he gets them into his power; and I hope he does,- for I'd like to see the whole . cowardly gang cut up myself.' Dave smiled at the talkative trooper. | 'You'll have a pretty good fight, won't ? you, when you do run 'em down?' I 'Not a bit of it,' sneered the officer; then looking very fierce, he exclaimed, I only wish T could gel; near the Killowens, , I'd' undertake to bag the lot of' 'em in no time. A man only has to show his teeth , to fellows of that class and they cave in ! at once.' . | Drawing his pistol. Dave levelled it at the boaster's mouth. 'If you ever prayed,': said he, 'pray now, for I'm going to shoot j you where you stand.' ! 'Shoot me!' exclaimed the astounded trooner. 'Why. who are you?' ; 'I'm Dave Killowen, at your service,' was the cool answer; 'and since you arc so' thirsty for my blood, why don't you do somo of the splendid things you have been brassing abent?' 'Dave Killowen,' gasped the officer. 'Why I�I thought you were a smith. 1 was only joking when I said I'd shoot you on sicht.' .-'**' 'Oh, were you,' sneered Dave. 'Well, ?he next time-vou joke, don't call otlier men cowards, for you are a pretty fine specimen of a coward yourself, let me. tell you that.' ? Dave made the boaster stand up with his handn held above his head, and he fastened him like that to the door with a couple of leather straps and a chain, and pinned this notice on to his chest � 'The man who captures bushrangers ? with his mouth.' bo that the folk who came to the. Jorge might see the braggart and enjoy a laugli at liis expense. . ? Then Dave got on the trooper's horse und cantered off tc play hide-and-seek with Inspector Vernou. It diet not take him long to resam the gang, and wlipr. he told them that Mahomet ' and' his Afghans were in the hills with Vernon and tbe~'black police, seeking to ; run the -gang to. earth, Bryan at once sug gested that thev should turn the tables on ' then- foes by riding as hard as horse-flesh would take them to the camp where Ma- 1 hornet had left his string of one hundred j camels. ..--..-?, Father was left in a place of safety on iceount of hit' wound, and the three young men did eme WE those wonderful rides' which Hindi1 tl'em an famous. The town- j Bhip where Mahomet had left his team was seventy miles, away, and, of course, was considered quite safe on account of the distance, but; the three were light, wiry, i and young, and all were tireless horsemen.] Their scouts brought them word that Vemen and his black police were beating the hills, the Afghans were guarding the ftul'ies that led to them, and the white ; police, -with' a few- volunteers, were frta- j CMi.-ed.wi all the likely points for an am bush. Vernon had- given the order .to shoot on sight. * 1' ??''? ' ' - ? ? . Dave chuckled, wlien he heard the report.

'I ^wish we could ride on like this for ever.', cried Bryaii exultantly : 'on and on ; - to the end of the world.' He loved hard riding with all his soul, and_ Clothing came amiss1, to 'him when- h* V could feel a good Animal between his knees. At last they saw the light of Gpongarrie township sparkling in front of them, and. they cantered straight iu and 'drew bridle ' in front of the police-station. ? Very coolly they dismounted and walked -_ into the police-station. Very quietly they covered the two police men with their pistols. ? . 'No nonsense, gentlemen.' s�id Dave sternly; 'Ve won't shoot linlefis you make us, but if we have to we will not heflttate.' It was the audacity of the thing that won for them. '. '. '~ The two constables were brave, enough, but they were unarmed except for their - truncheons, but clubs are no good against I pistols, to they looked very sheepish and j threw up~ their hands. j 'March to the nearest cell,'- commanded ; Dave: and away, they inarched, swearing j very hard in', low voices, for they Knew they I would never hear the last of that matter ] and that many a laugh would go round at their expense.' The constables were quickly locked up in. a cell. Then the three outlaws rode at a , walk to the Afghan camp, where the camels , were all knee haltered in a big circle, in the : middle of which the half-dozen hands, who had been in ' charge ofir Mahomet, were silently eating their evening meal out of one common bowl. The outlaws went directly to them, and called on them to surrender. . Odc oj the Afghans Enatched up a gun and was abqut to fire at Dave, when Basil McAllister seat a bullet into him. i This was the signal for a fierce fight. The Afghans, drawing their loug knives, rushed to the fray, and the outlaws used their pistols. Each of the three had wounds that badly required dressing when the* melee was over, and several of the ' Afghans were lying about groaning d|s- / mally. The outlaws made a rich haul, and were more than satisfied with the result of their foray,- and were moving off when a white man plucked Dave by the sleeve. He was one of the sundowner class, who' had been hanging about the camp to pee what he could steal when the raid com menced? 'What do you want with me?' was ! Dave's prompt query. ~ | 'You are leaving the richest prize behind you,' whispered the sundowner. 'Am I? What may that be?' 'If you go and look into that stable made of boughs, with a couple of canvas ' tarpaulins thrown over them, ysu'll see the finest horse that ever came to the back '*' country; it's a horse worthy to carry even a leader of bushrangers ' grinned the sun downer, holding out his hand for a reward. Davie dropped some notes into the grimy palm and walked over to the spot indicated, the sundowner going with him. 'Did you ever hear of a horse called Honeyball?' qiieried^the loafer. 'Honeyball, the steeple-chaser, do you mean?' 'Yes.' 'Of course I've heard of Jiim; but; you don't mean to say that horse is here?1' 'He's in that stable.
