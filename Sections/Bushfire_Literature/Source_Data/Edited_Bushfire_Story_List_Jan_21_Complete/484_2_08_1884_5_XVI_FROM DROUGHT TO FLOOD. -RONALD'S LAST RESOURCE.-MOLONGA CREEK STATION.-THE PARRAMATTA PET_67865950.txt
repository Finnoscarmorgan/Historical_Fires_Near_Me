 Let us now turn to Ronald and Aila Walton at Boorooma. pie period of their wedded life did not at this time exceed two years anil a half, bnt they had bocu blessed with two pretty children� Ronald Brandon and Aila Brandon, aged twenty months and eight months respectively. Ronald liked the name of Brandon� partly because his affection for Ada Brandon had been very sincere : and 

 partly, perhaps because three hundred miles of rough busb road separated him from his mother-in-law. He determined to add the name of Brandon to the Christian name, of names, of each pledge his wife presented him with, if there should be a dozen ; and indeed there was every probability of that number, or even a greater, if one might judge by the beginning. Like other mortals, they had their troubles and their pleasures. Their crosses were bnt light as yet, and consisted of the every-day vexetations that beset dwellers in the Australian bush, far, faraway from a township. As yet, they had no heart toables, so their love and unity far more than nnder-ballanced the petty annoyances that assailed them, and prevented those outside vexations from penetrating more than skin-deep. Would it could have remained 

 Ronald's venture had prospered for two years even beyond his calculations, and he had been able to pay off, not only the yearly interest and current expenses, but also a littleoftkedebt The last few months, however bad not been bo prosperous ; the driest season ever experienced by the 'oldest inhabitant' in the Moreton Bay Settlement � as Queens land was tfren called � had set in ; grass was getting scarce at Boorooma, and, in some parts of the run, water also. There was a splendid supply of water at the head-station, but that could not benefit, in any great degree, aheep many miles away at out Btations. The scarcity of water is not of so nch importance on a sheep-run as a deficiency of grass. If sheep can obtain a fair amount of succulent food, they can go without a drink for.days together, the withuot injury; so thatiftheyhaveasnrSdencyofgreenfeed, with in eight or ten miles of water, they can be driven to the latter often enough to save them from perishing for the want of it. But all this causes �*nrtl-*Bi trouble to the superin tendent and all hands on a station. Flocks must be carefully travelled through the runs of other flocks, and a sharp look-out kept to prevent them from boxing, both going and returning. Not a drop of rain had fallen for nearly twelve months, and in some parts of Boorooma the poor a.mmnla were crawling about in hundreds on three legs, alternately spelling one; and scores might be seen walking on their knees, having worn their hoofs to the quick with scraping the earth away from the roots of the grass, which they had nibbled far below the surface of the ground. They fell away in condition, and wandered about so, that the shepherds had much difficulty in keeping them together. The wool hong in rags from their poverty stricken sides, and altogether things wore anything but a prosperous appearance. The lambing was approaching, ana much af the wool had dropped from the ewes' sides ; so the hope of a good clip was destroyed. Moreover there would be no rood Brass for 

 the lambing, and the unfortunate lambs mnst be knocked in the head as soon as they came, for it would not do to add the extra strain of nourishing their young to animalg already too weak to outlive even a short con tinuance of such a season. The earth bad been parched by the fierce heat of the pre vious summer ; and the frosty nights and keen drying blasts of winter, succeeded by bush fires, oil conspired to hunt the strug gling squatter to his doom. The lambs of the previous season were stunted, wretched things, and would never make sheep, even if rain fell soon. When things had got to this state, clouds began to drive up the south - cast, and the hopes of rain began general. Light tantlising sliowers fell that did not so much as lay the dust ; then all cleared off again, leaving the sky screue as Imfore. The wretched sheep at last began to give up the useless for searching grass and the struggle for existence, and many laid down and died. Clouds again spread across the sky ; rain fell geutly, and the wretched ones took heart and made another effort to live. They had already eaten as much of the bark off some kinds of trees as they coultl reach. When the rain fell, Ronald walked out into it bare-headed, in an uncomfortable frame of mind experienced by men whose fortunes arc balancing in the narrow line, with ruin on one hand and safety on the other. He thought not of himself but of his wife and little ones. If he failed in his venture, what effect would it have on them ? He had the satisfaction of knowing lie had done all for the preservation of the stock that all could lie done. He was new entirely within, say a week, hundreds �of the sheep must die in the meantime. He walked straight away from the house passing the carcasses of many poor sheep, but heeding them not ; his thoughts dwelt not on the dead, but on the thousands perhaps yet to die, and his mind was racked and totaled 

 with hopes and fears for the future. The rain fell heavier and heavier ; still he walked on. He was dimly conscious of a pleasant feeling that the drenching rain imparted to his frame ; it kept down, in a measure the parching fever in his brain. He met a flock, of eager tottering sheep, and stood stUJ mechanically as they passed him. Why he did so, he knew not. Two or three of the strongest sheep stood on their hind legs, with their fore feet against an apple tree and nibbled at a few leaves that hung within their reach. He went up to them, broke off a large branch, aud threw it down Ba ' ba ! ba-a! bleated the lucky ones, as they tore at the lirauch, quickly stripping it of every leaf, and even the twigs. The whole flock sto.�I still at the joyful sounds, and listlessly turned their heads to sec what was the cause of such loug-discontinued notes. Some of the nearest rushed towards those that were chewing the 

 leases ; men ouiers, till the whole flock com prehending how matters stood, congregated round Ronald. He had made a discovery Why had !ie not thought of it before ? Why had none of his men thought of it ? He was at first astounded at the magnitude and im portance of the idea, and was incapable of action for a few moments. The wretched animals looked wonderingly up at him, and some ventured to bleat feebly, as though in supplication. The shepherd lazily drew closer to see what was t\\r. matter, for he as well as his flock liad long ceased' to evince however unusual. He was not very surprised, hcrcfore, to see his master standing bare headed in the midst of the flock. 

 Harry !' said Ronald, excitedly, ' run to yoor hut, get an axe, aud tell the hut-keeper to set to work as hard as he can, and cut away at the apple tree scrub on the fiat ; and as soon as the other shepherds come in with their flocks they are to help him. They must work with a will till they can't work any longer. Do you understand! Then you come back and blaze away at these saplings till you have not a go left in you. IT1 ^C it up to you somehow.' 'My wordllwilL sir,' said Harry, who, with every man on the station, would work 

 tor Konald at any tune till they dropped ; and in a ease of necessity like the present, they were not likely to do less at his bidding. As soon as the man had started, Ronald set off at a run for the head-station, which was three miles off. It was pouring with rain and that no doubt enabled him to keep up his pace better than he otherwise could have done. He arrived breathless at his home, told Jupiter to run some horses into the yard, and then went in to see his wife. She ha- not seen him leave, being engaged in her own room at the time with the children ; and when ehe missed him she concluded he had gone out to one of the sheep stations, and felt a little aggrieved that he had not given her the invariable parting kiss before starting Little Ronald had been prattling incesantly about 'Dear pappy dome 

 a gee-gee ; and When pappy turn back, mamma f ' He and his mother were fondling and chatting while the baby slept. Ada's surprise at seeing Ronald in such a plifiht caused her to ntter a little excitedly 'Oh! Ronald: How wet and famted you look I Where is your hat? Change at ' No, Ada. I must be ofl* again imme diately.' Little Ronald, or ' Ron,' as he was called or short, and as a distinction, collapsed and hid his head in his mother's bosoin, not recog nising his father. 'Why, my pet ! you do not know dear papa !' said Ada. The child looked again shyly, but was still 

 unable to recognise Ronald, whose hair and beard hung down and clung to Lis face and garments in such ungraceful fashion. The child exclaimed with scorn, ' Ronny not want ugly, had man, all wet, want dear nappy. Do 'way, mwn ;' ' Konald, you cannot go out again in the pouring rain. Pray go and change ; I will get you some dry things.' ' Must go, Ada. Good-bye. I am too wet to kiss you. I must visit some of the out ?* Horse long a yard, sir,' Jupiter an nounced. 

 ' Do stay, Ronald,' said Ada in her most pleading tones. *' Is anything wrong ?' ' No, far otherwise. I am going to feed the sheep. Good-bye, don't wait up for me.' He snatched his hat from the peg, put it on, and rushed from the house into the store, where he collected as many axes as he could cany ; at tlie same time directing Jupiter to saddle two horses, and to tell the liullock drivers, Smasher and Pinehgut, to do the same. He then trudged down to the yard with the axes, apportioning them out between ' Now, lads, you have it in your power to do me a good turn. Do it, and you shall not lose by it.' ' We'U stick by you, sir, through thick and ' My oath !' replied Pinehgut. ' I'm all here on that tack,' said Jupiter. ' Very well lads� thank yon. Now, you all mount, and I will hand you the axes wben 

 you are up. Smasher, you go to the Ten mile Station, and tell the men to cut down all the apple trees they can find, and let the sheep feed on them. You, Pinehgut, go to to Peak Mount Station, and do the same ; and Jupiter can go to rVenchman's Hut. I will go to the Haunted Hut, at Molonga The three hand* rode off in their several directions to execute their employer's orders Ronald cantered post the house, and kissed bis hiuid to A.la and little Hon. The Litter waved his hand, and cried, ' Dood-bye, r^PPJ'-' Ada returned the salute, and watched him out of sight, thinking thus, half ' He will be ill, I am sure. Such a dread ful wet afternoon ! and he has been over working himself, for a long time past. What 

 with the hard work and worry together it is enough to kill him !' She felt sad, and as she noted the track he took, she was aware for the first time where he was going, for in the hurry he had for gotten to say, and she to ask. Molonga Creek was eighteen miles from the head -station, and it was getting late in the afternoon. Ronald's horse sped on at a brisk canter. The track was (Joppy, and in places on flats and in watercourses the water was beginning to rise, for the rain had soaked the parched earth, and was running over the surface into the long dried-up channels and creeks. Fortunately it was not a cold rain. Hail it been so, it mast have spread great mortality amongst the miserable animals that tottered o\\-er tlie run. It was near sundown when Kimalil jumped off his horse and hobbled him out at Molonga Creek Station. The shepherds were juBt bringing in their flocks, and Konald at ouce issued his orders The men all set to work, cutting down apple trees, and other trees that the sheep would eat the leaves of, Ronald working with them till darkness closed in, and they could see no longer. The poor animals stripped the leaves off the trees as fast as they were cut ; and though, perhaps, the exertions of master and men afforded them but a scanty meaL yet it was a banquet, as compared with their starvation fare for some time previously They were all folded, and the ale men went into the hut, contented at having relieved so much suffering. The men kindly sorted over their clean, dry clothes, and from their scanty wardrobes subscribed a Scotch twill shirt, a blue Ben?e ditto. And n nair nt An/~\\r hm.~� 

 into which Ronald quickly put himself. Al the wet clothes were wrung out, and hung up to drain under a lirUe open bark shed, a few feet square, that was nsed as a 'place to cook in during the summer months. A good fire was made up in the hut, and all sat round it while the billies and 'jack sheas' were boiling. A 'jack shea' is a cylindrical tan vessel holding about three pints, into which a smaller one fits, the two thus occupy ing the space of a large one only and there fore a great improvement on the original quart and pint pots for the use of travellers and others. The men in the hut were Government men, but all looked cheerful. 1 ou have done well, lads ; and if yon see me through this job, you shall not be for gotten, I promise you,' said Ronald. ' Well work for you sir, bo long as we've got hands to work with. We don't want nothing, 'cause we owe you more nor that' replied the hut-keeper, a big man with a very bad-looking countenance, very mnch scarred. 'If any cove among 'em had refused to back you up, I'd just have flattened his probiBcus �that's what I would.' And he shook his great fist and arm threateningly ' Well, Pet (he was called the ' Paramatta pet') if any one had been blackguard enough to refnse to cut food for the starving sheeD ] would have tried my level best to Have \\nv'en him a dressing myself. But I know that none of you would do such a thinp '

You ain't got no call, sir, for to do no think of the sorts whiles I'm here. What am here for, if it ain't to do you any service as lays in my power?

That ud be a putty kittle o' fish for tlie missus : No, sir� you leave 'em to me. It's ray perfession, you know. I went over to \\\\ ales from Oxford to fight Slappy Bob, and he hit me a fowl blow-below the belt. The umpire give it agen him, and said it was all over. -No,' says I, 'it aint \\ou low roe a hour to get over that fowl hit, and see if 1 don't corroborate (prolnbly he meant castigate) him for that : Well. I rot up, and my hackers said, 'You looks bad yet old man. Dont go in again� tb: monev's youan now.' I says, ? No, I'll have the stake and him too far that ! My blood w^s up, and in three more rounds I pressed him to the 

 ropes, an.l broke his liack. I didn't mean to doit, but I got life for it� and here I am. ' ' Ha,v? -'?' secn 'Kf tracks of blacks about this end of the run, lately, Pet.' ' No, sir. Never a one since Poor Joe and Sam was killed four year agone by that black wretch, Molonga, as this creek is called 'Have you heard the rattling of the chains, anil tlie serveches, and stamping round the hut in the middle of the night, since you told me of it about a year ago ?' asked Konald I jestingly. ' , I ' No, sir. It did not come this year, and I we was'nt sorry for it, for it is the awfnllcst thing a man ever hear. Maybe it won't come no more � hope it won't.' '? 1 still think it is a superstitions fancy of yours � or at all events, that if the thing does occur, the cause may be discovered.' | ' It ain't no fancy, dr.

It's the most horrid thin-* ever heard It starts from the hack door,' goes three times round the hut, and then off to the Mir gum tree. Then comes the shot, and all & quiet for n year.' Ronaldjmused for a while, and then said, ; ' It is impossible it can be anything super natural. Many such cases have occurred, and have been set down to ghostly agency^ and have been cleared up by the sounds being traced to natural causes. Did you ever have courage enough to look out when you heard, the Bounds r ? I

He was . ^ that none of his mates liked, for he sometime. sat for hours of an evening with his head in his hands, and his elbows on his knees, irtari^

Ronald caught a glimpse of his face onoe fora second '���[?' anfaaaue 

 it bore a look th�t he never forgot. Billy then darted off to the big gum tree, attout fifty ymrds from the hut. Another streak of blue fluid hissed tlirough the darkness, enter ing the great gum tree at it topmost branches, and dffnding by the trunk rent it to atoms and apent itself in the earth at the roots. The nmidtaueoiis thunderclap was terrific. Far �. few seconds the wreck of the giant was Dlnminated by the fluid so vmdiy as to allow of a brief view of the surroundings, m which the DTOBtrate form of the wretched Billy Cant weirwas plainly viable by the blasted trunk. Ronald, 'norwithflt*''�'L' *'� alarm, went towards the fatal spot, calling to the men to follow. Only one did so-the Pet,, who ?hooted, 'Bring your lantou, Hul Hal plucked op conrage enough to do so, and followed quickly.

What is this !' said Ronald, as he turned Hal brought the light to bear on the object. It was a human skeleton, at the feet of which lay a -rust-eaten chain, its long links reveal ini to those present the relation it bore to the skeleton. There was another object^-the cor roded remains of a brass-mounted horse Billy CantwelTs body was carried into the hat. id laid upon his bunk. Sleep was not again thought of that night, and all sat by the lux. (To be aMtmied.)
