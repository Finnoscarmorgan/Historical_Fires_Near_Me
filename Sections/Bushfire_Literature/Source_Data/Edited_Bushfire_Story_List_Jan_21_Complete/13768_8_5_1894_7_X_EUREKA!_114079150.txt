In the person of Demas Dare Squire Fane had a relentless pursuer. Demas Dare was ? not a detective of the conventional type ; lie jiad received an excellent education, and had begun life as a clerk in a lawyer's office. He had been at this, 'work four years, when he suddenly found that it was not his voca tion. At the age of 22 he entered the ser vice of the secret police, and at the opening of this story he had so worked that he was one of the 'leading men of bis profession. Demas Dare was a man below the 'medium height, thin and wiry, of sandy complexion, a face of no significance, except for 'the penetrating glance of his keen grey eyes. During the short time that had elapsed since the finding of Mrs. Fane's body Dare had not been idle. 'When he was first appointed from Scotland -Yaid to clear up the mystery of Faversham Hall, he had come to the conr 'viction that Mrs. Fane came by her death ?unlawfully. Now he was convinced, he had made up his mini] to leave no stone unturned until he should probe this mystery to the very bottom.: Aided by his assistant, James Horace, they had between theirucol lected a mass'of evidence, though only cir cumstantial, pointing strongly against John Fane as the murderer. The more Detective Dare looked into the matter and studied the circumstances of the crime with regard to Squire Fane the more he felt convinced tixatthe squire was guilty. Dare had made his 'way to the Hall and had listened to the servants' gossip concerning the disappearance of Mrs. Fane, and had found out how the squire and his wife had quarrelled on the evening of Mrs. Fane's disappearance, and the threat John Fane had .used to his wife � if she dare_to do it, that he would Vili hjer-7� but what Mrs. Fane 'was going to do, the servants could not find out. Then, again, the squire had gone out on tiie evening of October. 10, the night .of Mrs. Fane's disappearance, and had not returned until late, the mud on his boots corre sponding with that from, the road leading to the ruins. Then there was the loss of the drees coat belonging to the squire, 'which was nowhere to be found ; the difference in' the manner of the squire from October 10 up to the present date. Dare had noticed him Belf when John Fane had been confronted with the body0 of his' wife how ill be be came, and was obliged to be removed at once, but not before he acknowledged the body as that of his' wife. Then came the testimony of Farmer Butts 'when the brooch was found ; how the same illness as that ?when John Fane saw the body of his -wife had seized him at the inquest. All these facts Demas Dare placed before Sir Charles Dorman when applying for a war rant for the squire's arrest, which he was stoutly refused. This incensed the detective more than the disbelief of the working class in the village concerning Squire Fane's guilt. Dare could imagine the uneducated villagers adhering to the squire, from whom they had received many benefits. But a man of education, a man like fir Charles Dorman, not believing in facts placed before him 'was quite another thing. After abusing the inhabitants of Faver sham, and calling them a parcel of d ? n fools, he set off to report matters at head quarters, and obtain what he requested there; thus causing the authorities to call upon Sir Charles for an explanation of his conduct in the matter, which ended by Sir Charles re signing his billet of justice of the peace. Demas Dare returned to Faversham .from London, four days' after the inquest on the body of Mrs. Fane, armed with a warrant for the arrest of the squire, which he put into execution at once, and John Fane 'was then committed to Maidstone Gaol to 'wait his trial, two weeks from hence. The next move on the part of the detec tive was to begyi a systematic inspection of the premises of Faversham Hall. In this inspection Dare 'was accompanied by old Peter, che butler. Every detail and peculi arity of the house, 'was thoroughly investi gated ; even the servants' quarters were care fully examined, and their occupants interro gated and critically reviewed. By the time Detective Dare and ' Peter had reached the box room, the last place to be examined, Dare had succeeded in getting very little from old Peter concerning the quarrel that had taken place on the night of October 10 last. The box room lay at the far end of the corridor, in the east wing. There was nothing in this room but boxes and trunks. 'If I could only find that coat,' the detective said to himself , ' my chain of evi dence against this man would be com pleted.' On entering the lumber room Dare turned and asked Peter if he would find and send him Brown, the squire's valet, as he would be able to point out the boxes belonging to the squire. As soon as Peter disappeared Dare seated himself on one of the boxes, and took a general survey of the room. Nothing in this room escaped his scrutiny. This preliminary survey being completed, the detective arose and began the exact study of the details. The room was bare, possessing no furniture of any kind ; so he found no difficulty in investigating it. 

 When busy with his search he was inter rupted by Brown. ' ' You sent for me, sir P' . said Brown, respectfully.. - ' tij _,.', I did Brown. I want you to answer mea few questions. Mind it will be for the good of your master that you answer me truthfully.' Demas Dare spoke .thus, having heard how attached this man was to his master. ' Do you know who was the last person to enter this room ?' ' I do not know, sir, but I think it was the squire.' ** Could you tell me how long ago was that?' ' Last Monday, sir.' ' Are you sure.' ' Quite, sir. He went to .fetch a book out of that box over thgre,' answered Brown, porting jbo a large box with heavy iron clasps and lock. . ' How did you know that ?' ' He came to his room, for the kevSj sir? and I was putting his things away at the time.' ' ' ' I thought all your master's books are in the-library ?' ' Those in there,' said Brown, indicating to the box, ' is full of writing.'* ' . ' Ah !' said the detective, while he care 'fully continued to explore the room. ' Have you the keys of that box, Brown ?' asked Dare, stooping to piek up two littita lumps of mud near the box in question. ' Yes, sir.' �t Fetch them and let's see -what is inside,' Brown having procured the keys and un fastened the ljox, revealed just as he had said, nothing but books with writing in, chiefly old accounts. The box 'was closed again, Dare gaining little information by overhauling its contents.. ? ' Demas Dare was beginning to feel very dissatisfied with himself, though he still continued his search for a quarter of an hour or more ; he then seated himself on one of the boxes, and soon became deeply absorbed, whistling softly to himself as he gazed round. Presently he turned sharply upon Brown, saying, ' Have you found the coat tiiat was stolen from your master ?' ' No sir.' ' Strange ! and you have no idea where he put it, or whether he had it on the next morning 'when you found Vn-m ?' ' No sir, I could not find it in the evening when I went to put his clothes out, but I took it off ~hiiy in the morning when Deborah helped me to get him to bed.' ' Was he so very ill?' asked Dare, watch ing Ms companion closely. ' No sir, he was more exhausted, he was just like a tiaed child.' ' Oh I' grunted the detective. Demas Dare then renewed his investiga tion round the room, closely inspecting every box, noting the locked and unlocked ones, and making inquiries as to 'whom each box belonged. Suddenly he came upon a very old ha.frterprl leather trunk, not very large in size, and evidently not English made. ' Queer looking thing. thaV' he said, kicking it, ' whose is it Brown ?' 'That belonged to madam!' answered Br�wn, going up close to the detective. ' Anything in it ?' ' I don't know, sir.' Dare then proceeded to examine the box j critically. ' Not locked,' he murmured to himself, ' lock broken. Did your misteess use this box.?' ' No, sir, not since she has been in Eng land.' Dare opened it, and lifted a small tray from the top, which he put hastily to the ground. He then took . but a small black i piece of cloth, rolled up very small from the bottom of the box. Unfolding it he cried out ' Eureka !' Brown, hearing the exclama tion from the detective, went forward, and seeing 'what Dare held in his hand, uttered the cry, ' That is the coat master lost !' The ! detective looked at him for a few moments, ] then he quietly said, ' You don't say so.' j Dare's 'work for the present 'was finished, | his analysis was complete. Gathering i together his trophies, he started* down the corridor to the stairs, before he remembered the hapless Brown, who had followed him closely. Turning round he said, ' Brown, it would be well for yourself and master if you did not say a word about 'what has hap pened in that room for the present.' But Brown did say ' a 'word,' and before the day was out, the news of the finding of the squire's coat 'was all round the village. After thif Detective Dare went to his lodgings and sent 'word to headquarters about the success of the search. CHAPTER XI. The Trial. Built on the banks of the Ki'ver Medway, in Kent, is the town of Maidstone, a quaint old. place, whose houses rise immediately from the borders of the river that flows in a wildly devious course, and gives beauty and animation to a fruitful vale, where' meadows, woodlands, rich orchards, and flourishing hop grounds combine to form a variety of picturesque and romantic scenery. The upper part of the the town extends up an acclivity, which is very ? considerably ele vated above the valley. It was April 6, 1843, the day appointed for the trial of John IFane, of Faversham Hall, for the murder of his wife. Going into the town one would imagine it 'was a holiday, the crowd is so immense, and the spectators so numerous, but it was not so. It was the opening of the spring assizes, for Maidstone has the shire hall . and gaol for the western division of Kent ; and there was great excitement throughout its streets on these occasions of opening of the assizes. ' The shire .hall is of a modern structure, id which the. assizes for that county are held, and other public business transacted, being erected at the1' joint expense of the corporation^ of Maidstone and of the justices' of i&B western division,.' -who hold their county., courts there, as well as' other meetings on general business Twomonths had passed since the finding of the body of Mrs. Fane, and six weeks since the arrest of John Fane for her murder. After the arrest of John Fane he was sent to the principal gaol, which stands in East-lane, and 'was erected in 1741, in place of the more ancient one that stood in the yerr centre of the town, there to await his triaL The day appointed for the trial ?was rough and tempestuous, with every now 'an-^ then a heavy shower of rain dashing against the rough, bricks and granite copings of the courthouse. The cold east wind penetrated into the. innermost recesses of that TiftH of justice, chilled with its cold 

 embrace the -vast crowd of spectators, whose lamp clothing exhaled a steam ? which seemed to wrap itself about the prisoner like a pall, as, preceded by the warder of the gaol, he entered the room with wavering footsteps and took up his position in the prisoner's dock. The place was crowded inside and outside ; around the doorway there were heaps of people, attorneys and their clerks, barristers, witnesses, ' and lookers-don 5 several villainous Jpoking men, and wretched women, who watched for the arrival of the prisoners, in -whom most of them took an interest. Even the passages leading to the court were blocked with people. John Fane took up his position in the prisoner's dock, a bowed and broken down man. He drew the chair that had been placed for him close to the railings of the ignominjous enclosure. With bis head resting upon his hands, he patiently awaited the opening of the trials Soon came the clattering of footsteps and calling for ordert when everyone rose to his feet and the court entered. An old judge, whose name was Steel, occupied the bench, looking, in his ermine and scarlet, the impersonation at Jsssr sad trf ' all that was dignified and venerable in man as he sat upon the raised dais at the further end of the room, beneath an impressive British coat of arms. Around a table directly under the judge sat the barristers, solicitors, and their 1 clerks. Various officials of different grades stand about this legal cosmos. And in the centre of the room, surrounded hy a sharp iron railing, high at the sides and back, but modestly - abbreviated down as it were towards the judge's throne in front, this is the prisoner's dock, wherein sat John Fane. The judge being seated the work of the court began, and the trial of John F^ne for the wilful murder of his wif e, Isba Fane, was begun. The clerk of the court arraigned the prisoner, reading the indictment, this being done with due dignity. Then the question, 'Prisoner at the bar, are you guilty or not guilty ?' 'was asked, and John Fane raised his head and moved bis lips in an inaudible manner-^-an answer that was taken for the negative. After this followed the empannelling of the jury, a ceremony in which John Fane betrayed little interest beyond the raising of his head to glance at the face of each new juror as he passed up, and he did not even arouse himself when the clerk of the court administered to the jurors their im pressive oath before passing to their box on the right hand side of the judge. The jury on being empannelled were not challenged by either Mr. Warden, the Attorney-General, who prosecuted for the Crown ; or Mr. Red burn, Q.C., for the accused. The latter, with Dick Dean, were instructed by William Griffith, John Fane's solicitor-. (to be continued.)
