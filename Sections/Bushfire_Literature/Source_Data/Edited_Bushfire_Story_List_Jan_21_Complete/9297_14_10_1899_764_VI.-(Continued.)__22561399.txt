REOOLLECTIONS OF A RAMBLING LIFE. 

 PIONEERING IN QUEENSLAND.

 By Thomas Aroher. 

 Glad were we when we emerged from the thickly-timbered and almost grassiest wil-<*> derness of the tea-tree scrub on to the more open and grassy though still timbered. 

 ridges, through and over which our road now lay, the came country that I hid traverse] with Fitsfimmons a week before, and which extended for about fifty miles to the Condi mine River, whfch we reached in ten days, and crossed (August, 1841), emerging on the glorious plains and beautiful open undulat ing ridges of Darling Downs, then the busb man's highest ideal of " good country." Bu: not for us was any of this suualter's para dise. Our detention at Blrallnn bad cut u� off from all hope of being able to take up a single acre of It (at least so we thought theft), and all we could do was to make our way across It and push on for the lf*!n Range, which loomed before us ou the east- 

 era aorlson, thirty or forty miles off, like a blujp cloud. After crossing the Condamin*. we le/t the road we had been 'ravelling on, and jttruck out across th� roadless open country, making for that part of the range cross* id by 'Hodgson's Gap, through which went jthe only dray road leading from Dar ling 1 towns to the Moreton Bay district and Brisbane. Our chief difficulty wax in per suading the sheep to make their way through the high, close, luxuriant grass that covered the plains, a task in which taj Yarrow hao often to take hi* share, by lurking at their heels and giving them a sly vlnch vow an-1 then. One night when we were camping be side a well-watered creek on the edge of a large plain, we noticed that a bush fire bad broken out on the other side of the plain, and, fanned by a very strong and bitterly cold west <wlnd, was burning furiously and making towards us. It was a grand sight In the pitch-dark night, to see a perfect wall of flame extending several miles across the plain, now, fanned by a gust of wind, shoot ing up 10ft or more from the ground, and then, in a lull, again subsiding, this veins repeated with grand effect nil along the lint of fire, according as the wln.l rote and fell. We watched this splendid slarht & little an xiously for a while, but, finding that Its ap proach was not so rapid as to be dangerontt to us. John retired to the tent and turned In, while I took the first watch, and as usual nodded comfortably over the fire, little heed- Ing that the grass was also on fire on the other side o� the creek, a couple of hundred yards from the camp. It had been set on fire by one of our own people, as he "was sure It could never g*t across the creek." Suddenly I heard some loud crackling and splutterin* In the creek, and. lumping up. saw to my dtaniav that the iflre had attacked a bed of tall reeds that extended across the crenk, and was rapidly making Its way over to our side, shooting up now and then, when fanned by the gusts a dosen feet In the air. and making a smoke dense enough to stifle a stoker. A rigorous shout of "All hands turn out and put out the fire" soon brought every one, black and white, to the spot, and at It we went with a will. It meant death to hundreds of the 

 sheep if the Are reached them, and nothing ?would Induce the stupid animals to more through the long grass In the dark, and thus otcape. Unhappily there were only one or two small saplings near to furnish boughs for beating out the lire, so we had to go at it with top-coats, rugs, and. blankets soaked in water, and for an hour It was very doubt ful whether the lire or we would get the upper hand; often when the wind lulled we would faucy we had conquered, but a strong' gust would come tearing across the plain, rairtpg a perfect wall of flre which sent v* helter-skelter �way from It, half smothered with smoke and cinders, and nearly falntlur with heat and fatigue. The men behaved well, and stuck to us manfully, Jimmy and Billy Grey especially distinguishing them selves, unhampered by garments as they �were, and at last, taking advantage of an unusually long lull In the wind, we all rushed in, and extinguished the fiery mon ster, Just as he waa about to roast and ds roiir the nearest flock of (sheep. The poor beast* stood looking on, petrified with fear, (but refused to more an inch to sare their lives. It was now my watch below, and. blacker than the blackest chimney-sweep, I entered the tent, and, rolling myself In our luxurious 'possum rug, fell fast asleep, John takio* the watch. Presently I thought I "heard a rush, a bang, and a voice calling, but I slept on till daylight, when. I dis covered that the tent had blown down, and was lying on the top of me; fortunately none rt the poles had hit me, so there waa bo 'harm done, and I crept out from under my canvas covering, hungry and dirty, but ready for any and everything after my five hours' sound repose. This "fiery ordeal" occurred. as nearly as I can make out, close to where the flourishing town of Allora now stands. To rest the men after their hard night's ?work, and give us time to wash ourselves and our wraps that had been used as patent fire-extinguishers, we camped here a couple of days; near sunset on the first of these days it waa reported that " Jack Smith had not come in with bis flock," so off I set on 'root across the creek to look for him. I hunted about up and down the edge of a large plain until dark, but all in vain; pre sentely. just as J began to think of return to camp, a flre appeared about a couple of Imiles off (as I thought) across the plain. *"Ah!" I thought, "Master Jack has got benighted, or lost himself, and made his fcanap there for the night; I must go and see what he to about." Off I set, and walked over the plain towards that fire for an hour (without seeming to get any nearer; in fact occasionally, when it fell low, the flre seemed farther off than when I saw It first. Just as I was thinking of giving up the chase and returning to camp, a gulf suddenly opened before me, and down I slid over a sloping bank for eight or ten feet, and found myself in a creek, but fortunately there was no water just there. Picking myself up, I wtared all about, and soon raw the faint (glimmer of a small flre in the bed of th* creek a couple of hundred yards on; slowly and quietly creeping towards it (lest It should be a blacks' camp flre), I caught eight of Jack's ruddy countenance glowing In the firelight, and gave him a low cooey; Jack had been a soldier (formerly a con vict, now an emancipist), and in an Instant be was at " attention," with his carbine ready for action if required. " Hullo, Jack, is that you?" at once satisfied him that the Intruder on bis privacy was no enemy, and in fifteen minutes he had a pot of tea boiled and produced a bit of damper for my supper, and we passed the night to gether by the flre, -without blankets, but sheltered from the bitter wind by the friendly bank of the creek above us. It appeared that near sundown Jack bad found hltr�elf further from camp than be expected, and, knowing; that he could not reach camp before dark and that his flock would not stir an Inch after darkness1 came on, he, like � knowing old shepherd and bushman, thought it better to remain at the creek wherr h*1 could get wood and water tban to risk hav ing to camp on the plain without either.

 aunriie next morning, after a frugal pot of tea shared between us (Jack's stock of the article not being abundant), we broke up. and I wai returning on my last night's track toward* camp, tearing Jack to feed the flock along after me at his leisure, when, looking round towards the place where tue lire had ap peared the night before. I beheld across the plain, and a little war up the side of an open ridge,, a white object shining in the sun,and flapping in the breese. a tent in fact. It seemed only about three miles off, so wheel la* round. I directed my steps towards it, aud after more than two hours' smart walk ink' (making it alz miles Instead of three), 1 cftme up to it, and -found it the centre of a large camp belonging to Francis and David Forbes, sons of Sir Francis Forbes, Chief Justice.of New Bouth Wales. Neither of t*n owner* was present, and the large centre tent was occupied by a young man named Webb who was In charge of the place. The country had been taken up for some months, and was being stocked a* quickly as possible, but there was then not enough stock on the ground to occupy one-quarter of the country cialmed, and the same was the case on the other runs, so that we unfortunate late comers had to pass over all this glorious aud almost unoccupied sheep-country, cross th� range, and plunge Into the most dismal, and (for sheep) most mittvrable country. But I must not anticipate. The right to claim more country than could be stocked at once was quite fair and Just when exercised wiln moderation ; it acted as an inducement to pioneers to undergo the privations, ba*d work, and risk attending the development of nevr country. All this hal ir those primi tive times to be undertaken by the pioneer squatter, there being then no paternal Go vernment to do It for him and tax him Tue name of the place I war visiting win Clifton, afterwards, by the capital and enter prise of the owners, developed into one of tha finest and most valuable stations on the Downs. After extracting all the fnforma ' tton I could from Mr. Webb about the coun try; and partaking of a good square meal, of which I was much In need, T trudged back to our own camp, which war at leist ten miles off, determined never more to trust to appearances in the matter of distance on a plain, especlitliv at nlirht. If c lire we�e the object one hed in view ; add 85 per cent to �thf apparent distance by day. and 100 pw cent by night, an* then one may be pretty net? a true estimate. Next day we broke up camp, and proceed ed oi: our way towards Hodgson's Gap, and in ft few days pasted Rodeaon'* statfon.Von Vale, where there was torn one slib hut. about lWt. by 10ft.. occupied by a hrotVr rt Mr. (now fllr Arthur) Ho4t*on. and a friend, th* H^n. Mr. Murray,, who when I entered the hut was reading at the fir-> with a pair of white kid gloves on his hands, the fl*** ni�n of civilisation T had seen for yea-s The sight of these rlove* Inspired me wi*h a degree of respectful veneration for their owner never to be forgotten ! At Won Vile we came ottt on a road I��adln* to the Cap, and camped *n or near th* sit* wh�ie Drayton township was afterwards bull* Here we were Joined by Uncle Davil a*�d BHly. who bad erp'ored pnd taken up �"im�? country on on~ of the head* of the Brisbane Hirer, about one hundred Titles from wh<*re w� now were. Next day we *ot to the top of the range, not far fr nm where the town of Toowoomba now stands, and thence gated down upon the Mormon Bay district, drained by the Brisbane River and Its many tributaries. The road down Hodgson's Oar was one of the most atrociously bad ones I bad ever travelled over ; flrnt a biidrt^n plunge down a steep hill several hundred yards long ; then along a siding, slopta? at so steep an at.gle that saplings had to be lashed across the horse-cart, and men ha* 4 to hang on to tbfm to prevent the cart from turning a sonwrfault down the steep gtilly that yawn ed under the road, a feat that Mr. Paddy Hrran managed to make the bullock-dray 

 porform, sending the load, consisting of flour and sugar in bags, tea is chests, soap la boxes, and wearing apparel In trunks, rolling down the steep drdi>ltj into the cbasir below, whence everything had to be carried on our backs, and replaced on the dray, under the rays of a biasing hot sun. After this another precipitous hill had to be descended into a steep and rooky creek, au l then about half-a-doesen steep spurs of the Main Range had to to crossed, separated ffom each other by deep and rocky gullies. This was the only road flit for wheel traffic between Darling Downs and Moreton Bay districts in these primitive times. A long spur a few miles to the norrh was afterwards discovered, which carriei the road past most of these impediments, an�l it does not reflect much credit on the busbnmnship of those *bo had to matte constant use of tbat vile Gap that they did not �ncr discover and* substitute the spur. After two or three days of thumping and banging about in this fugged wilderness we emerged upon more open country, and passed a station Just taken up by Mr. George Mocatta, from Bathurst. Here we left the Darling Downs and Brisbane road and struck off north wards to a cheet of water afterwards called Wingate's Lagoon, near Tarampa, a shallow lake about eight or ten miles in circumfer ence, *warming with wa:er-fowl of every description, pelicans, geese, swans, duekt of t&lf-a-dosen different varieties, coots, water hens, itorks, cranes, Ibis, and others too numerouH to mention. When a large flock rose on the wing they IHerally darkened the run when flying over one's head, and the sound made by their croaking and quacking at nlgtit had something weird and melan- 

 choly in it till on* got UMd to it. Here Jimmy had a line opportunity of displaying his quail lies aa a sportsman, by sneaking up to the edge of the water behind the tall reeds, .md letting fly Into the midst of a flock of swimming ducks, the result being generally from two to four or five victims, which gate us a pleacant change of diet after all these months of unchanging damper and mutton one day, and mutton and damper the nex:. Our pewder and shot were too scarce, ard our �ppetites too good to lei us " stand upon the order" of our shooting and ohey the rules of sport on such occasions ; tha mole that would produce the blggeet bag with tbe ftmaHest expenditure of ammunition was the favourite plan of campaign with our sportsman Jimmy.
