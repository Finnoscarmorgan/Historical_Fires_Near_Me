CHAPTER XXIX. 

 Walker felt' nervous and anxious' during the whole night. He got up time after time, and wandered about the stockade to see if any guard ot all was kept. He saw a light in Shanaghan's tent, and met him also making the rounds. Both men were deeplj' conscious of the peril of their enterprise, and perhaps the premoni tion of failure and ruin overpowered their spirits. 

 "Good night, Walker," said Shana ghau, "I see that you can no more sleep than I can. I hardly fancy those beggars to the east will dvit.urb us until we have the whole force of the colony on our hand." 

 "I don't think they will, but ono can't make too sure. There "is al ways a. risk." 

 '"Certainly then: is a risk. I'o tell you tho truth, 1 feel the amount of tho risk, and am beginning io wish I had not kept Nora with, me." 

 "Why, if you think that way, 

 don't you send her out? She lu her mare with her?"' 

 "Yes, it is over there behind mci slabs. Nora would keep it beside he ano I knocked that lot up for a st; ble. I thought the mare might I of some use to us. She is a clipper 

 . "Then put your sister on tho eli] per, and send her about her busines She is not wanted here." 

 "Well, the plain fact is that she 

 here only because I thought si Avould be of. use to us." If son of us . get wounded-and that is'vii! . likely-it will be better to have [ 

 woman's soft hands about us Uni men's rough paws. She knows wli; to do, and she is the Avoinan to < 

 her best." 

 "Yes, I am sure of that; but it is pity she should be sacrificed. ? I ca not help foreboding. Wre are sure 

 be beaten-even if we had all ti men to fight with us. Do you kno Avhat a fierce lot soldiers are Avhc the thirst of blood is on them? N likely you do, but I know they spa: neither sex nor age. If my sist were here, here she would not rema 

 one instant.'" 

 "I agree with you now. It is on now, however, that I do. I wish had thought of it before, but it is m yet too late. I don't know why it i Walker, but I feel as if I was comb close to.the end of the chapter. Tl volume is nearly finished, and moi than that I am glad of it. Only f< poor Nora. Her fate lies heavy c my heart. I don't know why I mu tell you, but just now I feel it woul be a relief to have some one to syn pathise, and Ave are both standing � close to the verge that- But, n< it is no use anticipating." 

 "Fate comes Avhether AVC anticipai 

 or not." 

 "True, and ahvays conies to th Avorst. I will tell you because . 

 seem to knoAv you, and that you hav been through your OAvn troubles. N one knows Avhat real sorrow is excel those that have felt it themselves. 

 Avonder if there is any compens�t io 1 Look at those stars. They shine 01 so calm and unchanged that on fancies the universe is brutally ur 

 conscious." 

 "That is exactly what I think. 1 is brutally unconscious and withou 

 care." 

 "Nora and I were the children of � Avell-to-do farmer in Glare. Nor Avas educated in a convent, I in Ki' kenny College. She Avas, a good gil ahvays, and I Avas ahvays uncontroll able and quick at resenting injury I Avas ahvays strong, and I think 

 made use of my strength more to in jure others than do them good. Bu Avhat is the need of going over al .these particulars? Nora grew ii] one of the loveliest Avoinen I hav< ever seen. There Avas no one to com pare with her in a county AA'heri beauty is no rarity. Both our parent! died, one very quickly after the other I detested country life, and spen most of my time when I uecame mj OAvn master in Dublin, and if yoi know anything of that city, you an aware a man can get through rnonej there a bit more quickly than any where else in the Avona, that is, iu .* middle-class style, of course not in thc millionaire Avay. Nora was left toe much alone for some time, and-AVC paid for our remissness. By heaven ? she was ruined, mau! Why 1 Vee] 

 impelled to tell you I can't under stand, and I doubt I shall hate yon afterwards for seeing me in a mo ment of weakness. We. determined to" come to Australia, but very much against Nora's will, I resolved to see her betrayer before I left the hemisphere. I did see bim, Walker. He was a good-looking young felloAV enough, and AVhen I spoke to him seemed to repent the thing bitterly, but he told me he Avas married. I struck him with a heavy stick I held in my hand, and left him insensible. We were suspected by no one, and embarked in safety. We reached Australia, and settled dovyii in the bush, and it was not for years after that I kneAV I had killed tho rnaji. You cannot conceive hoAV the horrid thoughts of the homicide take shape and haunt him, and yet if the same thing had to occur again I should act as I did. There is fate for you. Poor Nora! Her lot AV as a hard one indeed, and mine has not been much better. You will easily understand hoAV I regard this thing. I am a desperate ma.n. Walker,' and desper ate things chime in Avith my mood." 

 "You are not more desperate than I am, my dear . Shanaghan. If you killed a mau in your just auger. I have lying on my head for years the false suspicion ? that I killed a mau, and it sounds strange fdr me to say that your case is not much worse than mine. In some Avays it: is even better, for you stand before the Avorld while I have to sneak about under the subterfuge of a fal.se naine, and 

 am forgotten by those whom I loyt best or detested by them. I ha1 won money-honestly, by the swe of my brow-but of what use is it 

 me? My own country is shut o: from me and I from it. I like Au .tralia well, but just because I da not approach Scotland there is hard a minute of my life when its mom ries are not crowding in my min I call it a left-handed world. Is, any tiling else?" 

 "Cannot tell you. All we know that we are here, hut the why ar wherefore are hard to lind. We ta about order. He is a wise man th will lind law in human affairs." 

 The two men remained silent, ea< buried in the depth of his ow thoughts. The ruddy glow of dav had just begun to crimson the eastei sky and palo the twinkling stn with its feeble light, when sudden 

 Shanaghan caught Walker's ari: and bent down so as to catch the fain est noise carried on the little bree; which heralded the approach of da, Quickly he sprung up, saying, "E heavens! They have caught us n:i] ping," and then shouted aloud at 11 full compass of his powerful voie "Hillo, hallo! the soldiers are on u Up! up! Call Lalor, someone. Quid quick; not a minute to be lost. Arm arms." Ile leaped to the wall wit his gun, and looking over the breas work levelled his piece at the advai eing enemy, and fired the first sho The red coats had reached the neigl borhood of the insurgents' positio without the slightest warning bein conveyed of their presence. It wa a daring act of the commanding office to take Hie responsibility of the attae on himself, and if he had been out < his calculations it would have cost hil dear. Ile reckoned, however, on th difficulty of preserving discipline i au armed mob, as well as the lack c, preparation for receiving an attae. which was scarcely conceived as poi sible, and he had not reckoned will out his host. Never was a more eon plete surprise. The few men wh were at lia nd rushed to the breast wor when they heard the report of Shana ginni's gun, and ranged themselves b; his side. Walker ran backward am forward lo give them something o military array. 

 The order of a tin ck was given t< the detachment of the 40th, and til police. A volley was exchanged, am then the double breastwork was spion didly stormed. Shanaghan then tlirev himself in the front. His gigantic figuri stemmed the torrent, and for a mo ment the soldiers held back. 

 "Cowards," he shouted, "do you fea: one man? Why did you not dare t< come upon us when our men wert 

 here?" 

 English soldiers are not cowards and his challenge was accepted. Thc feeble breastwork was a very smal protection, and two of them were quickly on the top. These Owen sei zed in his two strong hands, and drag ging them apart hurled them one aftei the other amongst the men who were behind him. But that was the last glimpse of success; Hardly had ht displayed his wonderful physical power than a bullet passed through Iiis heart, and at the same moment two bayonets crossed in his body. Owen Shanaghan threw up his hand* above his head, and the brave spirit had forsaken its tenement before ibo body had reached the ground. , 

 Then it was "sauve qui pent." The surprised diggers rushed off in every direction; some into the riflo pits, where they were shot or bayoneted, and others into the bush-behind La lor, Walker, and other leaders fought; like heroes, but it was no use. Lalor Avas shot in the arm, and crept away, as he thought himself, to die. Wal ker was slashed over the face and left insensible, and it was thought dead. The whole attack was over in ten minutes, and thc Eureka Rebellion 

 was at an end. 

 Then the soldiers showed how they . .early in the'fight by the .noise and din 

 tis.". Everything combustible was soon in flames. Every man was an enemy, and was either killed or taken prisoner. 

 Nora Shanaghan was aroused very cary in the fight by tho noise and din of battle. She saw the soldiers and police scale the little ramparts in every direction, and knew, that all was lost. She saw defenceless men shot down or stabbed; nay, she saw death made doubly sure by the ruthless bayonet. Then the fierce troopers and the sol diers came up, but she stood calm and undaunted, and there was such divini ty in the stately -"woman that the mad dened soldiers forgot to be rude, and loft her in safety. The tent suffered': she stood beside it while they cut and backed the canvas io see if any rebe] was concealed beneath the folds. Cap tain Noel came up, and gave orders that she and her belongings were to be respected. Why so? Perhaps it 

 was that mysterious influence which seems at times to guard, the good �and 

 true. - r . 

 Nora knew that nothing but death would,have kept her brother, from her at such a time, and therefore she qui etly made preparations, for the worst. .The initial excitement soon calmed down, for the same .reason that, tho bush fire stops short when it reaches the bare,and barren plain. Nora wait ed until, all *show of resistance was passed, and then went to Noel, and asked him to be alo wed. to search for her brother's body. 

 Noel said to her: . "I think you are Miss Shanaghan. There is a friend of mine much interested in you, and 1 shall do what I can for you. We English soldiers only fight with the liv ing, and then only when they have arms in their hands. If you find your brother's body, I shall .give orders to lia ve it brought where you wish it. Still, wait-I shall, go with you. Some of my men are dreadfully enraged at the fall of my comrade, West." 

 Noel and Nora soon found what they sought. Poor Owen lay calm and quiet in the great pool of blood that had soaked the ground all around. She throw herself on the body, and for a minute indulged .herself in all the luxury of woe. Noel had thc body brought to the tent, and as they were returning Nora recognised the body of Walker, although the' whole* head seemed cloven in two. Noel at the sanie time recognised if. 

 "Ah! Miss Shauaghan, there is a man I Avant saved if there is life in him. Will you'undertake to do what you can for him?" 

 "Certainly," she said. "Even if you had not earned already whatever I can do for you. That is Mr. Walker, the mate of Mr. Malcolm and Mr. Wil loughby." 

 "Yes," said Noel, with a slight smile, "and Willoughby is a very old mate ol' 

 mine." 

 Nora saw at once that there Avas no hope of her brother. He Ava s dead in deed. But Walker,although his AVOUIKI looked even more ghastly than Owen's, Avas not fatally Avounded. She stayed Avith thc Avounded man until the flick ering finnie of life strengt honed. Then she paid the last sad duties to tin; dead. Site had many friends ready to assist her, and Avheu their offices AV ere concluded she sat down to think. 

 God! IIOAV heavily that day passed to the bereaved Avoman! The horizon of life seemed to have crept in on her like the Avails of the dungeon Avhielt greAV smaller every day in the sight of their doomed victim until at. length the unrelenting iron clasped and 

 killed. 

 Still she had other work to do to keep her from despair. Walker had to be saved. When he recovered his senses he found for himself that the Avound Ayas only a skin Avound, and that nothing serious Avas injured, and no bones broken. His medical educa tion stood him in good stead. With Noni's assistance the wound Avas bound up. and the "dead" Avasrcstored to life. He Avas awfully Aveak, but still he had hope. Nora left the enclosure -no longer au enclosure- and easily procured a trap to take Mr. Walker to Blythfield. Dr. Pirie Ava s there and all his friends, and he kncAV they Avould conceal him from the prosecu tion and persecution if it. lay Avithin their power to do so. 

 "God bless you," he said, as he left. "God bless you, Nora Shauaghan. You are a noble Avoman. I see UOAV that, often when men take a reckless course they do not risk only their own lives. I hope to see you soon. Farewell." 

 Walker reached Blythwood in safety, and, Avhat was most singular, brought the first tidings of the attack on the Stockade. Nothing could keep Bill from riding afc once to Ballarat, but he found that suddenly all reasons for doing so Avere taken aAvay. 

 Nora remained for hours in silence Avith the dead after Walker had left. _ Her heart fed on the past and' its bitter memories until her AV h o le being seem ed to rise in rebellion against the ini quity of life. What had'she liAred for? What benefit had her life conferred on the Avorld or on herself? There Avas complaint and self-reproach in the misery of her thoughts. But Avith Avhom can it be otherwise? We owe a grudge to Fate for our OAVII lives. 

 Suddenly there Avas a noise, and the opening of the tent Avas drawn apart, and iMarkey stood before her, blood stained and Avay-Avorm
