' � Sunday coa', or what lver else it jack-in-tbe-g which looks a! if it had bin KWassage machine. Blow'd if I iver heerd tell av tL like un av bad luck mver since I ve bra on tbe frost side av the Blue ilcuutaiaa. It bates aU my Cuth � xnaricnce out an out, so it does. ' Vee^ you have certainly met with some singu at a- D,,ort ft dov Mr. Mahony,' aaid Mr. Hopewell ; �-but I must candidly tell you, I think some ol them, It least were the result of your own improper coa Surt You coveted that thief's plunder, and to obtain ft v'oii bad recourse ft deceiiful artifice ; and you wrre uniiu'lftl in many particulars. Although ?rplribution does not always follow similar acts so mrnmntly as it bss done in your case to-day, it is Jprtsin that, Eooncr or later, all acts of covetousness, j 8nd falsehood receive their due punishment. I must, however, fairly admit, that ia your case there wcere nalliatory circumstances, and in the eyes of many nenons vour whimsical stratagems would seem justi lahle, and be called � fair play.' Still you may de mend upon it, my friend, that truthfulness at aU times, and under all circumstnnces, is the only safe course ,ou can adopt ; and whether you woik with your tends or your head, honest work is the only work you cbb reasonably expect ft prosper. I am, however, far from thinking that this is the worst day in your history, after all, for I have liope concerning you, which I cannot explain just now. You are here, alive and well, end you have been mercifully pre setted from bodily injury ; you should thank God for that. You have had food enough for the day, aud ?you' have liad strength given you to bear all your troubles : he thankful for that bIso. This day e trials are past, aud you will not see tbem again ; so as you cannot remedy tbem by fretting over them, your wisest plan is to look hopefully to the future, while you strive to profit by your past misadventures.' ' Yes, air,' replied Micky; ' that's thrue for yez, livery bit av it. As the poet says, ' The days are pist lhat we have seen.' So they are faith ; aud it's not a Jiit av good grumbling about em. If I was to howl for a fortnight it wouldn't rise my brogaus from the bottom of tfie creek, nor sthop me swag from swimming out Jo sea ; so tbe best plan I ban tbink av is not to tuink av them at all, but to hurry away back to my owld gierlli aa fast as i can. an earn money to buy another jig out, and thin either I've got ir, thry to take beltber care av it in future. This day's disasters will help to gneke me more continted in time to come, an make gne more careful to kape a good beith wheu I've got me, an not be tbryin me hand at things I don't jg-nmv nnthin about.' ' 1 see you arc a philosopher,' said Mr. Hopewell, Smiling. . ?' Police officer 1 not a bit av it, sir, nor mver was in jme life ; I niver had the good luck to dhrop into eich -nti aisy billet. I've bin a shepherd more nor twenty ?years ; an afi re that I tried me hand at almost ivery port av bush work, barrin bushrangin, an I niver Iried that game sfore to-day ; nor I'll niver thry it Sgin neyihir, for its a villainous trade, that's pritty pbure to lead to Jack Ketch's castle at last. I should fist like to tell all the bhoys in the bush my honest opinion av that cowardly way of gettin a limn.' ' Hew many years have you been in this colony, 

 $Ir. Mahony ? ' asked Mr. Hopewell. ' Will yez be afther cillin me Micky, sir, if yez joleze ? I'm downright scared when yez call me mlisther Mahony, bekese it makes me think av me poor owld dad, who's dead an gone. Folks used to call him Misther Mahony on SundayB; and well he desarved it too, poor sowl, fur he was as honest a man as iver peeled a trier, so he wor. Well, sir, I've bin an this connibry two and thirty year come next March. Yez nsydn't axe me -who paid me passage out here ; it ?wasn't me poor owld dad though. I'd strong circulars given me, by order of a learned owld friad av mine a home, and Governor Darling -was recommiuded to take great care av me, an mind I didn't citch cowld by Joeing out at night. Whin I got to Sydney I was pressed to stay and help to build a large house of ac commodation for other visitors like meself ; an there Ivor a good lot avthim inthim days : more's the pity. jAfther a time a frind av the Governor's invited me to �0 into the bush wid him; an I was glad enough to �0, bekase the cais in Sydney used to throuble ms a good deal. Faith an I soon found there were cats (wid Mine tails) in the bush too; but they didn't bather me ?quite so often as they did ia Sydney. Well, sir, I've Jbin in tbe bush pritty nigh iver since ; end though I Fays it meaelf, there isn't a cove this side av the cour.thiy as knows more nor I do about bush-work av all sorts, from shepheidin. to shingle-splittin, an from pliitin cabbage -tree siunet to makin whishky on 2hc sly,' ' You must have been a very young man when you Erst came here, Micky,' remarked Mr. Hopewell, ' I was, sir ; an able young feller too ; as sthrong Ss a cart-horse. Troth I'm not very wake now for an Did man, though I didn't altera take the best cue av Sneielf. Still sn all, I've seen many fellers put under ground who were as able an as hearty as meself; be the same token, some av thim didn't come to their end through fair play, worse luck,. I've had no end av scapes from death afore to-day ; but I'm as hard to kill as a native-dog. Twice I was speared by the Jilacks ; onst I wor nigh drowaded w a flood, an another time close tip roasted in a bush-fire ; onst I Wor tossed by a wild bullock ; onst I wor bitten by a Ehnake ; an onst I tried to hung meself wid me belt ; hut the sthrep broke just as- 1 wor giving my last kick.' 'Dear me i' exclaimed Mr. Hopewell, with a Shudder j �? and had you died then where would you be now?' ' Dear knows,' said Micky ; ' I niver thought gnuch about it, sir, It would a kin a settler wid me, lhat's all I know. I shouldn't ha drawn any more kations, nor slops nayther, that's sartain. Bat bless yer heart, sir, I've know'd lots av poor crater who nave killed themstlves to get out av their misery ; J ez wouldn't wonder at it nayther if yez know'd mil the misery they'd cot to bear, in one shape or another, that you wouldn't. Troth, I could tell you yarns as wnd make all yer hair stand up as stiff as jspike nails.' -,'Tf 6et out of their misery, indeed !' exclaimed rnlr. Ilopewell solemnly. ' It fairly appals me to think �t the poor deluded victims ! Hickv hear me, my Jiicnd, and pray remember what I say, for by your town admission, the idea of suicide suggested itself to 3'ou to day when ,}'0U first picked up that pistol, I fear that fatal sin is sadly freq-uent in the bush as weU as in our cities. By suck a frightful act a man in evitably plunges into the gulf of eternal misery. OfaU fformB of murder self- murder is the most horrible. It is utterly hopeless, for repentance is impossible. By Such an act man rushes unbidden into the awful (presence i of his offended Maker, stained with, the proofs his defiant violation oi one of God's imperative v�8' Oh, Micky ! be thankful that you were spared iron i the comtniesitm of such a terrible crime as self aRd pray that you may never be deluded into Mother such attempt. But will you tell me why you led to contemplate auch a sad act ?' Iwdlsir, ' esid Micky; 'though when I think *v it it makes me shiver an shake like a blackfefiow !?,a.fr?st! morning. 'Well, sir, it's many years agone : I d had a long job splitun posts an rails, an puttin up Stockyards, an other rough work, on a new station, far away backwards. My mate, Jem Wedges, an I, had a pritty good sum av money cominto us, an we wanted � bit av a spree, jist to knock some av it down ; so we Eoes to the super one day an axes him for an order jor forty pounds, and thin away we goes straight to I~f grog-shop at;Guzzdeton, which was about fiveand ?ve�tF files off. Whin wo got there in course we sanded our order over to Miather Tapps, the landlord, arid thin began knockin it down, like jolly buahmen aUera does. We know'd old Tapps. wud pritty soon � us whin the order had aU . run out, so we didn't 'nil/ out8e^Tes about nothing but dhrinkln an playiu Oi,. J18'' fingin a bit now an thin,- av course. Mi!.0 / '' days, for there were not many kmwt ?kout -the -place at that time to help us dun ,i .'own quicker; an it was rayther a time altogether, for we only had three little 

 biti av fights� but niver a regtar shindy at all. On the ninth momin Mr, Tapps sings out. 'Hilloa me hearties, yer order's all knocked into nothing, ivery hepenny, and thirty shillings to the new.' My mate wee knocked down too he was very bad in bis head ; I don't know whether it was from tho bad rum, cr from a crack he got wid the leg av a stool the night afore. Well, I kno'd it tvor no good etoppin there any longer after old Tapps had lipped ub the wink to be off, so I coaxed a quart av lum out av him on the new score, an away I goes towards the station aein. all alone ; for my mate 

 ;ouldn't walk at all, en I hadn't got sinse enough in ir c to sthop an look after him, bo I lift liirn at the ;hanty, fast asleep and spachelcss. Well, I reeled alone shout seven milee, sucking out av the bottle ivery now and. agin, till at last I tumbled down head aver heels, and wint to sleep. When I awoke agin it was derk night, so I finished the rum in the bottte, an soon wint to sleep agin. The next mornln whin I rouBed up I was as stiff as a skeleton, an awfully miserable soh ; I wud almoet hav given me sowl for a gill av rum ; but there wasn't a taethe in the buttle ; so I got up an hobbled along a lit'.lc further towards home. Och ! what I suffered thin vez oouldn'tpioture if yez tiiod for a month ; nor I couldn't tell yez if I'd got twenty tonguis. It fairly frightens me to think ''Bye an bye I heerd a horrible noiee behind me, sn whin I looked round I seed tbe divil on a black horse ridin. afther me as hard as he could gallop, an roariu like a tiger. OffI scampered through the buEli, straight towards a running creek. Wnin I got to it X dashed down the steep bank and jumped into the wather ; but it wasn't deep enough to smother me, so I groped through it to the other side. The divil followed me to the top of the creek, thin got off his hDrtc, tied him to a sapling, and looked at ine wid his great big red-hrt eyes, like doctor's door lampB ; an be reared out, ' Micky Mahony, I've got yez naw, snvhow ; you cau't git away from me, so yez naydn'c thry.' He thin began to wade through the creek to git at mc ; wid that I pulls off me belt and made one end fatt round the limb av a tree, and put the othtr end round me nick ; but jist as I was turning meself off I sicd me poor owld mother right afore me, which scared me worse still, for I know'd she wor dead long ago. I don't recollect anyihing more, till � awoke lying under the tree, wid the broken strap round my neclt. How long I'd laid there, whether a day or a week, I never could tell ; but I was awful bed for many a day after that ; an the firsht bit ov news I heard, when I got hack to the station, was that Jem Wedges wos dead an buried, poor fellow ! I never tried to hang meself agin, nor I niver will if I kape me sinses. I allera think my poor owld mother hud somethin to do wid the breaking ov that strap ; an nobody will make me tbink she hadn't. I was mighty seber for a long time after that sheavo ; still I wasn't meself at all, for a very little nsise at night used to set me trembling like an owld lady in a cellar full of rats.' ' ? 

 ' O Micky, that is indeed a dreadtui recital, saia Mr. Hopewell. ' You were providentially saved from an awful doom, for which you should thank God with all your heart. Was your mother a good woman?' Indeed, she wor sir,' replied Micky, while the tears courBed down his rugged face. ' She wor a dear lovin' owld sowl ; an' shure enough she's gone to heaven. I can call to mind, as plain as if it were but a week ugone, how plszed she wor whin she could coax me to go to church wid her, . -which wasn't very often, more shame for me. An' ho w she wad pray be me bed after 6he thought I was fast asleep. _ Ah, many times I've heard her sighing aud sobbin , an' praym' God to bless me, wicked hsythin as I wor. I can remember, too, the prayer she tached me to say whin I wor agoEsoon, not taller nor my shillelay, an' the hymns she used to sing� for she could sing like a bird, ay, sweeter nor all the birds in the buBh. Ah, poor sowl ! I shall never hear her darling voice again.' 'Can you repeat one of the prayers ynir pious old mother taught you, Micky ?' asked Mr. Hopewell kindly. ' 1 don't think I can, sir ; for something sticks in me throat, tn' nearly chokes m-, wheniver I think ov anything me mother tached me ; but I'll thry to Bay one, or a bit ov one, if it will plaze yez, sir.' Poor Micky thus began to repeat a simple little form of prayer ; but before he had uttered three sentences, he burst into Bn immoderate fit of weeping, and cobbed aa if hia heart would hurst. ' Och, mercy, mercy ! I can't spake it if I was to be killed oat right. I havn't said that prayer for nigh forty years. Och me darlint owld mother 1 it smashes me iutirely to think on yez, so it does ; an I'm fear'd I broke your tinder loving heart too, wid my wickedness Och hone! och hone! The darlint owld cratur; I shall niver see her agin, niver, niver, niver ! ' Poor Mickey then put his head on his knees, aud cried aloud ; while his prudent companion sat quietly by, until hie paroxyBm of grief was over. ' I am pleased to see these signs of affectionaft remembrance of your dear departed mother, Micky,' said Mr. Hopewell, at length breaking a long silence. �' But you need not sorrow without hope, friend ; yon may meet her again in Heaven, and share with her the joys of that happy home of rest and peace for ever.' ' Och, sir ! Y'ez don't know what a wicked wretch I've bin, or yez wouldn't he after saying that, I'm ssrtin. Whisht, sir, an I'll tell yez truthfully, as ye've bin sich a kind friend to me. I onst robbed a church, so I did, an that's what brought me to this counthry. You can't say I shall go to Heaven afther that, I'm thinkia.' ' Well, Micky, that is a serious crime certainly, a very grievous sin; but had you killed all the congrega tion belonging to. the church, too � nay, had you com mitted ten thousand of other crimes equally heinous, God's mercy would be to you if you truly repeated of your sins, reBolved to forsake them entirely, and humbly asked God, for the sake of His dear Sou Jesus Christ, to pardon you, God would surely forgive you freely, restore you to his favour, and receive your soul to Heaven at last. Here is God's own word pledged to d Dir.' Mr. Hopewell then opened his pocket Bible, and read a few encouraging passages therefrom, and after wards briefly explained the simple plan of salvation, through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ while Mickey sat by end listened, with overflowing eyes and a throbbing heart.
