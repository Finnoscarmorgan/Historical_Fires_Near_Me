CHAPTER VT. 

 Twice within four days Evan came home at 6 o'clock and there.was no tea; such a thtog had not occurred before all the years they had been at War-dincng. ?.'?.;/? 

 .The first time when he came in Mary was sit 

 ting in the little living room, one of Dorrie's new : stockings in her hand. But all the time she had sat there not once had her darning needle passed aurrss the knee chasm that so.urgently needed at 

 tention. . . , 

 Evan locked first surprised, then, as he glanced again at the table wi-ere the children's lesson bocks and a pile of mending still lay, his expression changed to a somewhat injured one., 

 The day had been fiercely hot; it was early Feb-, ruaxy, and, as though the sun at that p�ritid;.was not hot enough to bear, together with; �i�^�foUr months' old drought, bush fires had begun to rage 

 hi all the districts around Wandinong, and the air was chokingly thick and oppressive. A dull smoke mist hung on the hills to the south and east, to th-� west and north the fires could be seen, glowing red at night, pale sheets and tongues of flame In the day. 

 Hardly a man in the camp was at work; up and down the creek, wherever a tree flung any shade, they lay on their backs, with their hats over their eyes, and their pipes, mostly out, just In their lips. Jones's mate owned a thermometer; when he told them it registered 120 deg. in the shade they felt justified in their idleness. 

 But Evan had worked in his dogged way the whole day long; he never allowed himself a holi day. Twice he had almost given in, and gone to a- few feet of grey shade that stretched temptingly adjacent, but the thought of Mary's life urged him on again, as it always did. 

 For the last month he had given up washing; I'.e had found that only by ceaseless" work at it from Monday morning to Saturday night could he give Mary enough to keep the miserable little home from falling apart. So once more he tried pegging out a claim, and digging 

 away at th� mocking earth in the hope of wresting some little piece of its hidden treasures 

 away. 

 He had managed to put a little box of dust aside, however, some months ago, for a rainy day, and Mary had said she would con trive to make the unwilling ends of this month's expenses meet with lt, so that he might have a few clear weeks for his new operations. . 

 '. But even he had no very clear Idea how he had struggled through that terrible day; only for the Increased heap of soil and stones flung out on his claim he 

 could almost have believed he had lain in a stupor all the hours since breakfast. 

 Across the flat, bare lands he dragged his weary limbs; but for a few thin linea of smoke rising behind the scattered tents, he could have imagined the whole camp had been suddenly deserted. 

 There was no smok� line on his own.hilltop, but that was not remarkable, for Mary, these fierce days, cooked in the earliest morning, and made a careful study of keeping things as cold as.possible for dinner. 

 Evan thought gratefully of the cool drink she would meet him with; his burnt, aching eyes tried to ref resh themselves with a momentary mental vision of the little table, with its coarse white cloth and fresh fern decorations, its food as temptingly cooked and dished as circumstances would allow. 

 But when he entered Mary seemed still . darning, and the little room waa . in uninviting confusion. 

 She did hot even spring up to meet him, put her dear face up for his kiss, welcome him; soothe him, try to smooth the day's 

 troubles away with loving fin- � fingers. 

 He could never before remem ber the omission. True, there were days and days when he hard ly seemed to notice her welcome, barely returned her kiss, an swered shortly, irritably, and si lenced Instantly the children's chatter. But Mary would never know the Intense apprecia.t.on he had of it. - 

 When he came In this night and she made no movement, he stood/and stared at her. She started at his footsteps like one awakened from a dream, and hurriedly began to run her needle to and fro across the rent her hand showed' through. But ehe spoke no word ait all. ; 

 "I'd better go and wash my self, I suppose," he . said at last, heavily. 

 She started again, and looked at him- strangely. "What!" she said. : : 

 "I said I'd go and wash," he repeated. 

 "Oh," was ali she said. . 

 He went to the poor little bed room with a strange chill at his 

 heant. v " .' ,' ".; 

 Even, when He carne back in his alpaca . coat, : and with all traces of the soils of the day re moved, she had not stirred to 

 prepare the meal- '. 

 "Is there no; tea, Mary?" he . 

 said, after another strange si- : 

 lent lapse. 

 "Tea?" . she repeated dully. Then darning away again with 

 great rapidity, "I have given the children theirs ; they have gone to play for a ; little time." 

 "You wou�d like me to get my own?, . It was too hot for you, Mary?" 

 "Too hot," she assented. - She leaned right back in her corner, and let her hands Ile idle. 

 He weat �way into bhe small, lean-to kitchen, . and af ter a little time kindled a fire" and set the kettle on. 

 Only that he knew his system .urgently required refreshments he would not.have attempted it; but illness was : an evil he dare not dream of facing. So he drank' tea, and ate a slice or two of the soda bread dry ; there seemed nothing else in -the 

 box aofe. 

 But the food almost choked him ; there was an icy hand at his heart; fear, absolute.fear, made his hand tremhle till it could not hold the cup. 

 "She. had given up,"'he said-"Mary-given 

 up."; 

 ,A: blankness like death walled him in. Mary, who ; had chirped and laughed, and made joke� through all these bitter years, who had plucked up his own failing courage a hundred times, who had worked from dawu till dark, fought the world with those 'brave little hands of hers, shed no tear of pain-when it flung her. spun wonderful sunshine into her children's li vee-Mary, given up; �ittlng 

 ia the Jiving room, looking straight before her, her hands lying idly clasped on her knee. 

 Something like terror, seized him; he saw the world as a strange hell; he trembled for his own soul, for the souls of �Dorrie and Bert. 

 Stumbling feet carried him to her; he fell on his kDees .beside her; he clasped her waist; his head 

 was on her hreast. - - - - 

 "For God's sake. Mary," he said, "don't give up." 

 She seemed to wake .from torpor-this dear head on her breast; these straining arms; this voice with agony like death in it; they were her husband's. 

 "Darling," she said-she stroked his thick �hair .ur:certainly-"Darling;" then she leaned back, and seemed to forget him. 

 "Christ!" he said. He seemed like a man in tho suffocation of drowning; he hurt her with his arms, his heart leaped against her like a mad thing. "Don't' give .up--a little time, Mary-Just a little time longer-help me, my wife-cry to Hli'rn, beseech Him, force it from Him." His hands sprang suddenly Into the air. his face in its contortion of passionate .pain lifted itself, and till 

 the burnt- eyes- stared fiercely:at the ; tent fly. 

 "Lord God of the World,':' he said; "Give us gold-' Christ of tho Barth; now, mow, now.".. , ' ;~> 

 . She did her. best to calm him; she loosened his 

 arms' fierce grip; she smoothed his hair; she drew his head ito -rest. on the quiet of her breast ' And "Evan," she said-'-'Darling-nothing matters^-. Why are you like thI-3? We have each other-hush, 

 . don't ask like that." 

 They ohing together till the last light in the room died out beneath.the warping door flap.' ! 

 And neither bf them spoke one other word. ' * ; '

 .A-- statistician -has been devoting himself to a study of the eminent in ' ballet dancing,, and his Investigations seem to establish the fact that bal let dancers are an' unusually long-lived lot. The famous Carlotta Grlsl is living now at the age of 77, and one of the ballet dancers at the Opera In Paris ls 70. But he is a man. Amalia Ferraris is still teaching at the age of 78 in Paris, and seems'likely to continue that work for some time to come. Fanny Essler was 74 when she died, and Tagllonl has passed her 80th year. Rosita Mauri, the popular premiere at the Opera in Paris, is over CO, and has begun to talk of retiring.
