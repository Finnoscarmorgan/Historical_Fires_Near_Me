CHAPTER IX.-THE SICK MAN'S APPEAL 

 If we may trust to "the veracity of the preceding chapter, the 6 th day of January was a hot one, because everybody said so, and everybody is a pretty shrewd sort of a fellowï¿½ you know. At all events, we are justified in being positive in regard to the 7th, and in Btating that it was the hottest day ever known in Australia, because the papers said so; and if the paperB said so, it must be so, in spite of miracles. The N Minor, in a moment of unguarded en thusiasm, forgetting the ever watchful Hammer, indiscreetly asserted that the 7th had visited N with special severity, and cited instances of steaks having been fried on the plates without the aid of fire, and many other wonderful things. Thereupon the editor, of the Hammer, who never failed to feel like a gladiator when confronted by any statement of the Mirror, brought his herculean imagination into play, anil per petrated one of the must stupenduous lies 

 on record. Thus 

 " In the small township of N--, on the banks of the River Murray, there exists a small paper, whose small editor, having once eaten the Darling pea, is possessed, amongst other delusions, of the belief that he has , a standing amongst humanity. Now, the latest craze of this little lunatic's brain is that the township of N has been honored with a specially hot day, got up by a special Providence, for the special purpose of furnishing the annual new para graph for the Mirror's column. Of course the editor referred to is at liberty to say and think what he pleases ; he may, if he' chooses, fancy that N was the only place where hot weather was experienced on the 7th, and it is no business of ours to set him right; but that a truth-respecting public should be led astray by unprincipled agents, is an atrocity which we cannot and will not tolerate. It becomes our painful duty, whilst sympathising with the above demented individual, to purge the taints of falsehood from the minds of the one or two accidental readers of the Mirror, and to lay before the general public, in our columns, an incidental proof of the fact, that to Wangaratta falls the distinction of handing down to posterity the seventh day of this month as tbe champion scorcher. 

 " It.will be remembered by all who take a healthy interest in the progress of Austra lia, that some years ago a man was mur dered on the bridge which here spans the Ovens River, and which is overlooked by the town. Soon after the murder, rumors began to move that a ghost had been seen at various times sitting on the railing of the bridge, just over the spot where the deed was com mitted ; but, as is invariably the case in such matters, ithe minority who saw the ghost where looked upon as liars or fools by the majority who did not see the ghost. Finally the spectre dropped into a state of oblivion-a state it would probably have continued to enjoy but for its indisoretion on the night of the sixth. Mr, Johnstone (a gentleman whose ill-health has induced him to try the virtues of our pure air) had occasion to pass the northern side of our town about mid-night on the night in question, and was much surprised on look ing towards the bridge, to behold a white figure seated on the_ railings. Fearing that some somnambulistic efforts were endanger ing the life of a townsman, Mr. Johnstone, with philanthropic motives, walked in the direction of the bridge ; but, on approaching within 50 yards, was horrified to disoover thafc the object of his careful thought was nothing mopo or less than an animated shadow. ' Too fearful to advance, too much overcome to reteat, the gentleman gaged for a monjent or two in petrified wonder upon the ghost, whilst the latter, seeming not to notice its human companion, heaved a deep sigh, and drawing forth a shadowy handker chief, seewed to wipe the perspiratjon froi# 

 its shadowy brow, apparently in a state of great exhaustion. Mr. Johnstone ha j 

 time to observe that the spectre was mucn overcome, when animation returneia 

 momentarily paralysed limbs, and he from the scene. On the afternoon 

 following day-the 7th-Mr; Johnstone, being unable to banish the vision from li mind, and being enticed by that ai r g fascination which often draws people towards a dreaded spot, walked down to the bridge, and closely inspecting the place y*ere 

 ghost had sat, discovered a minute greas 

 fpot upon the pine railing. He.ed the part carefully and thought the matter out, but was unable to connect the Presence of the grease spot with any natural ca . For many minutes he- considered^ question, and at last, like a flash of g 

 the truth burst upon him-the ghost.JM, the natural assumption, based upon circum stantial testimony, was, that the SP'" 

 the murdered man, indiscreetly venturing forth on the night of the 6th, was so o 

 come by the sultry atmosphere aa to De unable to retreat to its mysterious abode, and, falling a victim to the unparalleled heat of tho following day (the 7th), was melted down and reduced to a single spot ot 

 grease." 

 No! there could be no doubt that the 7th January, 18-was a hot day. Jiven before daylight in the morning the atmos phere was still and sultry as a sunless noon, and ominous waves or puffs of warm air stole at intervals over the forests and plains like breaths from a heated furnace. When the sun did rise, it loomed red and lurid, like a ball of fire, through an atmosphere of smoke and gloom, which was oppressive to the very last degree, and the day opened more like a sweltering evening than a dawn. 

 the valleys the. heavy ?mokes was as dense clouds ; the hills were closely veiled, and, over tho open plains, the fumid atmos phere liung like a dry fog deepening in the distance to an opaque wall of murky haze, The bush fire set its mark on everything. So, with a threatening growl which was like the roar of a distant sea, and which waxed louder and louder as the heat increased, the gloomy, lifeless morning rested upon Wyalong. The day was slowly developing in sultry heaviness-struggling, 

 it were, through hours that were gloomy and overshadowed, as the bushman knows them when the fierce heats of sun aud fire mingle in a smoke-veiled atmosphere-as Leo Morton ascended the hill at the back of Wyalong, q-nd looked out on the diatar^ca to the north-west, First the bevelling hills, smoke draped "and lustreless, sloped with gradually diminishing heights to the level of tho sweltering heat-stricken plain. The river lay beyond witli a sfcrealc of murky film clinging over its waters *, then more plains, and yet further northward the limitless reach of sombre mallee scrub, across its bosom, sweeping down in an unbroken face of 12 or 14 miles, a wall of fire flames and black smoke such as the eye of man seldom 

 rests upon. 

 It did not take Leo long to sum up the situation, he h^4 feared, the squatters on the north side qf the fiver h^ failed to conquer, during the night, an enemy which, under the influences of a hot day, would gather irrepressible fury } and well he knew that whilst the day lifted qa resistance conld be offered to the fire whioh was sweeping down upon Kolkibertoo. Who could tell what devastation might be wrought before night came round once more ? He had no fears for Wyalong, be cause the river's broad bosom would effec tively bar the progress of the destroyer in that direction, but his thoughts flew with anxious forebodings t<f his friends at Kolkibertoo. He descended hurriedly and went straight to the horse yard, where the stable boy was in the act of ct*tcl}ing a hack, for the purpose of running up the 

 cows. 

 " Harry !" - "Yes, sir!" 

 " Put Dandy and that Snip mare into the waggonette. Look alive, now; and have them ready in ten minutes," and, turning towards the house, he came face to face with 

 Frank Oxford. 

 " Steady, old man/' cried the latter ; why such hurry on a day like this ? And why this responsible tone of coutenanoe ? Upon my word, you look like as if you had been bowled for a duck, or given ' leg before' by an umpire with a squint-what a lot of umpires go hrfor Bquints !" 

 "It is the bliss of ignorance which lends serenity to your brow," replied Leo, leading his friend quickly towards the breakfast room. " If you were given to understand that your breakfast must be swallowed in ten minutes, perhaps your own countenance would elongate. We've got a big thing on to-day, Frank ; that is, if you feel up to it. Of course, I'm not going to drag you into a day's work simply becauie I tackle it my 

 self." , 

 " Ho, I'm about, my boy! What's on the 

 board ?" 

 " Very well; if you are about, show that you mean business by. wiring into this," and as he spoke Leo opened an adjacent cupboard, and produced therefrom a round of cold beef and a loaf of bread. " This is not much of a meal, but we cannot wait for the ordinary breakfast an hour hence ; so, wade in, old fellow; the cook brings a cup of tea in a few minutes. I have just been on the top of the hill at the back of the stable, and I am sorry to find that the folks on the other side of the river have not con quered the bush fire during the night, as I hoped they would have done. That was their only chance, for it is simply impossible to do anything with these scrub fires in the day time. It is coming down aoross the mallee with great fury even thus early, and when it reaches the, silver grass plain, under the heat of a powerful sun, its speed 

 will be terrible." 

 " It won't cross the river, I suppose?" 

 " It is possible, that odd sparks may drift over and light the grass on our side, but all our hands will be stationed along the fiver's bank to quench at once any fires thus started. It is the Kolkibertoo people I feel anxious about."
