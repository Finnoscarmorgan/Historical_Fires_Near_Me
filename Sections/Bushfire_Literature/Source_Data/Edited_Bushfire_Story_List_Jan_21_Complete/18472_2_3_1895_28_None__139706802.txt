 HAL STAINER. 

 By Ltnktte. 

 " That ought to be Hal Stainer if my sight is what it used to be." 

 " What, the man who did his wooing in a 

 mad-house ?" 

 We were driving over that noble plain between Tocumwal and Jerilderie. A dense warmth wrapped the land. A lukewarm rain was falling, and everything seemed to have resolved itself into an odour of wet oilskins and steaming horses until the squatter spoke and-pointed with his whip to a buggy some distance in advance. I wanted to have a look at Stainer. We overhauled his buggy at the public gates. He jumped out, opened them, and stood waiting till we should pass. Closing gates is one of the finite ideas of the Riverina creed. Thpre was no time but for an exchange of greetings between the two men as our horses slowed through. Stainer bared a round, close-cropped bead to us and the rain�a clean-shaven, well-featured face, bright blue eyes, and very white teeth show ing in a pleasant smile above the rim of up turned coat-collar. The hand that raised his hat was of the leg-of-mutton type, the voice that spoke us well wishes might be heard above a river's in flood time. There was no space to note further, and I turned to hear the squatter's story. 

 " I had just married and got properly settled at my place when Hal Stain- r came from England and bought the run next mine. That's about ten years ago. He was a splendidrlooking youngster,and fook easily to a hard life. His father was an officer in the 

 Guards^and when he died not worth his funeral jexpenses, Hal borrowed �14,000 from an old.friend ot the family to start life here. He was pledged to pay back the money within a certain time, and worked harder than any three men 1 know put together. As soon as his house was finished, Stainer sent For the girl to whom he was engaged.. She was a distant' -cousiri, very pretty and nice, and . dependent on relatives. I never understood 

 why thfey became engaged. It mayhave been a fauniy~-arrangement or the girl's dependfenoe, for they were nqt in the least in "/love with jgach other. I saw that directly 

 j ;Vthey were togetherat myvhouse. Miss Allen Tb�that*yas her name�came to stay -with us' 

 till Christmas; the time fixed-Tor the wedding. It waa ftlfon early Deoetaher. Christmas came, hut ire cobldn't think . of orange blossoms with bush fires sweeping the country. T had -been out three dayl and Stainer. five when our parties joined. Gad! how we worked. Night was as hot as daft but brighter, and both were a curse, - It was not until I gave in and the big fellow working by my side dragged me under - a dray that I recognised Stainer. Then it - .'was only by a sort of instinct. He was black

 was rising out ol a sea of smoke and 

 y$l; 'Merry Christmas, old man. I ought 

 on my honeymoon.' * 

 " I went to sleep and when I woke rain was falling. 

 "The day after I got home I heard that wild dogs were amongst Stainer's 6heep up at Puck's Eyes. 

 "When thefire8hegan Hal's stock had been driven up to Puck's Eyes, and Stainer himself was there fighting the dogs. We got no news of him for nearly ten days. His sweet heart was flirting with the township doctor, and seemingly never wanted to hear of Stainer again. The marriage was indefinitely postponed pending disposal of the din 

 goes. 

 " Everyone else had'gone to bed, and I was writing in my den, when some one knocked at the door. I opened it, and Stainer came in ahead of a volley of dead leaves and twigs, for there was a furious wind storm blowing. I put him on the sofa and gave him champagne till the awful look went out of his eyes. As true as I sit here the man had a wild-dog look about him, a wild dog at bay that's going to die fighting. He told me he was sick for want or sleep and the memory of tiiat borrowed money. 

 " In fifteen nights I've only had a few hours' sleep. We've killed the dogs ; now when I've time to sleep 1 don't know how. I got home early this evening, had a bath, clean clothes, and here I am.' 

 "He took a pencil and tried to write some thing that looked like ' fourteen thousand,' on the cuff of his shirt. It was a silk one. He wore no coat or waistcoat. 

 "I got his mind off the money and dingoes by other talk, and when he got up to leave he asked in such a rational manner for a loan of the rug on which he had being lying that i was not so surprised at the request as I might have been. Now this rug�we called it that for want of a better word�had been given me by an Indian merchant. It was a composition of wool and silk, buff-coloured, with my monogram in the centre, and a fringe nearly two feet wide made of knotted silk. Stainer rolled it up tightly and fastened it round his waist. He promised me he would go home and sleep, and I saw him on to his horse and watched him ride out of sight. 

 " It couldn't liave.been more than twenty minutes later, I was fixing the den before gpjng to bed, when I heard something outside. 

 My mouth got as dry as if I'd been holding it., 

 open to a hot-air bjast, and my heart ticked t _ louder than the Qlocjt.'' It was a long-drawn " howl, so like a ditigd's cry that it would have been answered by' dingoes had there been'ttoyv 

 in the neighbourhood. But there never had" \\ been, to my knowledge. Besides, I Jelt it was not a beast's cry.1 Someone'ran round the verahdub and down tothelagoon. Then came the overseer's whistle, followed by an answer ifig whistle from the. men's quarters. I tell you I couldti't move till then. 

 I went out and met the over-. seer coming to call me. The night was clear, but the wind was terrific. We could scarcely hear each other speak. Stainer was riding to and fro on the edge of the lagoon, howling, and trying to force his horse into the water. It was one of the best bred and 'cutest horses in the country, and from the way it kept its head, must have known that the man. on < its back had lost his. A lot of the bands bad come up, so we made a circle round Stainer, then closed suddenly. He just rode us down, yelping at us like, a savage cur. The overseer and my self hung on to the bridle; shouting en treaties through the roaring wind. Me he knocked out with a blow on the chin; wrenched free from the overseer, and gal loped up that hillock where the flagstaff is now. That brought him facing the full 

 force of the wind, and a curious thing re- : 

 lady bra8sby. 

 The interviewer in the Strand Magazine,- from whose article we ^some weeks hack made abstracts, gives the following account of a chat Vith Lady BrakseyHer ladyship is tall and handsome, of stately presence, and with a very winning smile. Lady Sybil de Vere Brassey� as her fall name runs�is the youngest daughter of the late Viscount Maiden, granddaughter of the Earl of Essex,.and sister of the present earl. Her father died before succeeding to the title, so she never lived in her beautiful ancestral home, CasBiobury-park, Hertfordshire. She was married in 1890, and has on� little girl, the Hon. Helen de Vere Brassey. Before her marriageshe lived very quietly, and travelled but little. She is well read, an enthusiast about sculpture, a great walker, a tine horsewoman, and very fond of punting. Like her husband, she delights in the pleasures of the chase. Her ladyship has many canine pets, her favourite being a beautiful Dachshund, Grafin (Countess), the one shown in our picture. Lady Brassey founded a convalescent home for children at Bexhil), Sussex ; is a constant visitor at the Seamen's Hospital, Victoria and Albert Docks ; and is on the committee of the Mayfair Union for the care of young girls. Lord Brassey is described as of genial, kindly manner, well known not only in political, naval, and social circles, but everywhere a cheering word can encourage or wealth succour, if the cause be 

 good. 

 suited. His shirt, which was secured at the waist by the rug, filled with wind, and stood out at the back, tense as a drum. Then, with an explosion like the ripping up of a sail, it split from neck to waist. That terrified the horse. It dashed down the slope and into the lagoon. Stainerthrew himself level on his saddle, lowered his head, and lapped at the water like a dog! In a minute he was climbing the opposite bank. In five, we were on our horses and full pelt after him�a madman riding a bolt 

 ing horse. 

 " It was forty-eight hours later before the black trucker picked up Stainer's trail in the dry bed of a creek, a few miles from Puck's Eyes. All the morning we followed the tracks, and at noon came on Staitier's horse�dead. 

 " ' White fellow very Bick now,' said the tracker, as we rustled forward through the long, grey grass ; ' he walk like this,' imitat ing the swaving gait ol a dru> ken man. At nightfall we lost the trail. Heavy Btock had just gone over the ground, and the black fellow failed to distinguish it. We were weary men, I tell you, and sad ones when we doubled back to Puck's Eyes that night. 

 " Next morning, while we were heading for home across somebody's land, one of my men 

 shouted� 

 " ' There's a calf chasing the sheep.' 

 " In the paddock towards which he pointed a mob of sheep was rushing about helter skelter, trying to get away from a curious, tawny-looking animal that followed them. It certainly looked at that distance like a calf. We waited outside the fence until it should circle abreast of us. On it cattle at the tail of a lot of terrified bleating ewes. It passed�a ram with its horns through my Indian rug, its fore-feet and one of its hind ones through the long fringe and 

 my monogram fair on its back. 

 " We could only conjecture how the beast got the thing over him, but we didn't stop to do it just then. By a water-hole in the next paddock we found Stainer, lying under a patch of scrub. A dead sheep and a live snake were his nearest neighbours. He stayed in a kind of stupor till we got him home, when he became unmanageable. The expert we fetched up pronounced him tem porarily insane, through exhaustion and brain fever, so poor Hal went to an asylum, and Miss Allen became engaged to the 

 local doctor. 

 " Stainer was in the asylum three months. 

 He told me he might have been out a little , sooner had he wished, but he had a score to pay oil against two warders who had treated nim with indignity. He lay low and waited for his turn. It came. Stainer had no 

 capon but his fists, and if you saw them ou'd know he didn't need one. After'he *lmd fixed up the warders so that their /< (torn mothers wouldn't know them, he locked ,xyhem in the cell, and walked off to tell some 

 one in authority what he had done. He found the doctor's apartments, and knocked at the door of a room where a piano was being played. A young lady answered the knock, and told the well-dressed smiling in quirer with the bunch of keys that Papa wpuld be Tn presently 1" It seems she mistook him for a visiting doctor. Stainer was good company. The girl was pretty and both were muBical. Consequently, while the greater part of the staff and a lot of mild.lunatica were racing over the house and grounds looking for the' dangerous maniaty who nan broken Ioobp,' Stainer was singing duets with the doctor's daughter. And when the doctor himself came into the room nearly an hour later be noticed that bis daughter did not look very pleased to see him. 

 '' Some months afterwards Hal acted ashes� man where he was to have been bridegroom. Miss Allen married her country dootor. 

 " For the next two years Stiuner spent an the holidays he conld afford as agnestm the place where he had been a patient,wooia% tn girl who sang duets with him. She sings them with him yet." -,. , -
