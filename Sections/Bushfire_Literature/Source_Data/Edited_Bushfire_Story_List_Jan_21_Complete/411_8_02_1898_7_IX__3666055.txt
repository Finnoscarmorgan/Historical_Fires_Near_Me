 CHAPTER IX. 

 Long before the hour at which the proceedings in the Police Court began the room was thronged. Keith, much against my advice, had Insisted that I should act as-his lawyer, and conduct the case for him, in vain I pointed out that I was not the man I was once, and that for him to trust SUCH vital in- terests to my old whis�ky-sodden brain was the height of madness. Ah, many many times before this trial was over was I to curse the criminal iojushuegs that had changed the cleanest and acutest brain in the New South Wales Bar to a broken down machine, which only by occasional flickers gave evidence     of its original brilliancy of thought ! Ah, the man I was, the man I was, and the wreck I am now ! 

 Ten o'clock found me seated in court at the lawyer's table; and a few minutos afterwards the police magistrate took his seat, and Keith Hope was placed in 

 the dock. 

 After the preliminary formalities, Dr. Liston was first called. He gave the same evidence, almost word for word,   

 that he had given at the inquest. Charles Summers had died from the effects of a fracture of the skull, caused by some blunt instrument 

 Sergeant Quigley said something to his attendant constable, and the latter produced a short stockwhip handle. 

 " Might this weapon have caused the fracture ?" Quigley asked. A thrill went through the court as the doctor, after examining it carefully, answered, 

 " Yes." 

 I turned and looked at Keith, and noticed that he seemed very excited. 

 That completed Dr. Listons evidence, and Dr. Jones was the next witness. He also was of the opinion that the whip handle, now called exhibit A, could have produced the wound from which Charles 

 Summers died. 

 William Richards was the next name called, and my old friend, Billy the half - caste, looking at first very frightened, was piloted to the witness-box. After the first few questions he became quite collected, and gave his answers intelli- gently. He described how Mr. Lessing, Master Charlie, and himself had set out for a bush fire, on the last day of February. He told how, when they arrived at it, Mr. Lessing and himself had at once commenced to beat it out, while Charles Summers left them to see to a fence. Then, while the whole audience hung breathlessly on his words, he told how, about an hour after- wards, he had heard a cooey, and on going in the direction of the sound, cameo to where Mr. Hope, the prisoner, was standing beside the dead body of Charles Summers. The excitement was intense, when Quigley producing the whip handle, asked him did he recog- 

 nise it. 

 "Yes," he answered. 

 " Was it ever in your possession ?" 

 " Yes, I made it myself out of a piece of myall. There is a snake, with brass eyes, carved round the handle." 

 " Inform his worship how you came to part with it." 

 " I gave it as a present to Mr. Hope." A murmur went through the court, and the constable called " Silence." 

 " When did you see this whip last ?" " The day that Master Charlie died, I found it on tho ground, a little dis- tance from his body." 

 " What did you do with it then ?" " I gave it to Mr. Hope." 

 " Did he say anything to you when you gave it to him?"   

 " Yes ; he said at first he didn't have any whip ; but afterwards, when I showed him the snake on it, he took it" 

 " You have known Mr. Hope for some years, have you not ?" Quigley asked. 

 " Yes." 

 " Did you see him a day or two be- 

 fore the fire ?" 

 " Yes, I saw him the evening before." 

 " Can you remember anything that took place then ?" 

 " Yes. Master Charlie and I were doctoring a kangaroo dog that had got hurt, and Mr. Hope came across to us, and said he was sorry, but he had shot him, and then they had some words." 

 " Can you remember what was said ?" " Master Charles called him a butcher, and Mr. Hope got ' narked,' and said if it had been anyone else's dog he would have had the law on him, as well as shooting the dog." 

 " Did the deceased make any 

 answer ?" 

 " Yes. He said he would get even with Mr. nope." 

 " In fact, the two men parted in anger ?" 

 " Yes, I think so." 

 That concluded the sergeant's ex- amination of the half-caste ; and I de- clined to put any questions to him. 

 My idea when I had entered the court that morning had been that there could be no evidence to warrant Keith's ar- rest, and that the case would probably be dismissed from the police court. The more, however, I heard of the evidence the less I liked the position in which Hope stood: and I determined to let   the Crown state its case fully now, and to reserve our defence till the assizes. 

 While I had been busy with my thoughts, Mr. Lessing had gone into the witness-box, and had been duly sworn. What he told was mostly cor- roborative of the half-caste's evidence. I looked at him very closely, but any hopes I might have had of being able to read his thoughts from the expres- sion of his features were completely baffled. The face was as masklike as ever, and the smooth voice in which he answered the questions which were putting the rope round Keith's neck was the same to which I had listened with dislike in the Currumbede draw- ing-room. His account tallied in every particular with the half-caste's, till he reached the stage at which they found the body, and then a new piece of evi- dence came out. 

 " You say you heard a cooey ?" Quig ley asked. 

 " Yes, I heard a number of shouts. Billy and I went in the direction from which the calls came, and found Mr. Hope standing beside the dead body of Charles Summers. As soon as we came up Mr. Hope said that the deceased had got a sunstroke." 

 " What happened then ?" 

 " I examined the body to see If there were any signs of life, and found that Summers was quite dead." 

 Here the police magistrate asked a question. 

 " When you looked at the body, did you notice any wound on it ?" 

 " Not then, your worship. I did after- wards."   

 " When ?" 

 "The same evening I assisted the de- ceased's aunt, Miss Summers, to pre- pare the body for burial. She drew my attention to a slight bruise on one of the temples." 

 " Was it on the right temple ?" 

 "I cannot swear positively, but I think it was, your worship." 

 " Did you not think it strange that there should bo this wound?"   

 "Not at the time, your worship. It appoared so very slight that I thought he might have received it while being conveyed home in Nixon's waggon." 

 "You are sure that it was from the accused the suggestion came that the deceased had had a sunstroke ?" 

 " Yes, your worship, absolutely cer- 

 tain." 

 As I knew that from such people as filled the body of the court the jury would be drawn who would eventually try Keith for Charlie Summers's mur- der, I studied their faces carefully, and was alarmed to see what a bad effect 

 this evidence apparently had on them. I could see that nine out of every ten had made up their minds that he was guilty ; and that they believed his try- ing to make it appear that Summers had died from sunstroke was a clever 

 ruse to avert suspicion from the crime he had committed. Bad as this part of the evidence was, however, there was worse to follow. 

 Quigley resumed the examination, and Lessing deposed to the finding of the whip handle, and to Keith's denying at first that it was his property. 

 " After this what took place ?" Quig- ley asked. 

 " Mr. Hope left us to go to the station to send a conveyance to take   Charles Summers' body home. He came back in a short time, and told us that Nixon, the saddler, who was on his way to Currumbede in his wag- gon, would be with us directly. Mr. Hope had said that he himself would go and tell the elder Mr. Summers what had happened, for the sooner the body was " buried the better." 

 "He said what ?" the police magis-   trate cried. 

 As if totally unconscious of the sinis- ter meaning hidden in the words, Less- ing answered, as smoothly as ever:   " The sooner the body was buried the better, your worship." 

 I went across to Keith and asked him in a whisper if Lessing's state- ment were correct, and I was dumb foundered to get the reply, " Yes, I said something of the sort." 

 Charlie Summers had been a great favourite in Nandewar and as Keith   did not often come to the township, and never associated much with the people, I believe those in the court would have hanged him cheerfully, without hearing anything further, when they heard what Lessing said. That 

 completed his examination by the Crown, and I did not ask him any ques- tions.
