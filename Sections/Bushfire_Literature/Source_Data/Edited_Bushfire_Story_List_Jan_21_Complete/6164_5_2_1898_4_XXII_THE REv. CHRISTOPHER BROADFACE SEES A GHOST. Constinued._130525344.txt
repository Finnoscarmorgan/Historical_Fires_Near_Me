 CHAPTER XXII. The Rev. Christopher Broadface Sees a Ghost. ContiriMid. 

 Mr. Broadface was not wrong m re gard to ^ea-Cliff Towers being � sincu I� iohfritancfi for a womnn. Yet it is women who, more often than not, bi come the possessors of the results oE crimes which mm havq committed ; and under such burdens there art) few men who will earry themselves wiih the composvne and patient fortitude Hhiohniost womnn will. 

 Tiicy who under tlio litfle ills of life show- impatience and petulance so quickly, will often, when confronted by a series of overwhelming disasters and uirefortunes, display a quirt pa tient heroism winch commands atten tion and respect When Beatrice was made aware of the full details of the story which (he cklectives had to leU, and knew that the corpse of both h--r uncle and her late legal adviser and would-bp suitor, lay in the north end chamber of the houBe, she was horrinVd and frli that the burden was greater than she could bear. Fortunately J)r. Strong was greatly recovered, and he end Grace were able to advise her, and the painful incidents asKocistrd with the inquest were made as litile distressing to her as possible. Anyhow she born up wonder fully under the shock. The inquest, which wae htld in a room of the only liotel which the vil lage boasted, lasted for two days, the jcrors spending an afirrnoon in the in spection of the fateful bid chamber 

 men, at least, had descended to their deatb. The proceedings w*re treaty protrac'wl through the difficulty of the I jurors arriving at a verdict. The de lect) v�-s wen- simply staggered st t!ie position, for there was absolutely no evidence forthcoming which could be successfully used in support of a charge of murder. Mrs. Dalb-rt teas siill at large. By the advice of liis solicitor Beth .Rosedale gave no evidence, int the case, %s he was under arrest on a charge. trftuurder. But the question suggest ed to the jury was, how could it be ' proved to have been murder ? Neither tliu dry mummified form of liayaiond Ballantyne, nor the corpsi- of Septimus Dorset, showed marks of violence, cen under post-mortem examination. Dr. Strong saw no assailant, and could only give evidence I hat violence was offered him by some person or persoi.s un known ; beyond the revolver Laving been dashed from his hand by some thing or someone, be knew of nothing which suggested any premeditated vio lence 10 himself. Raymond Ballautync tui^ht have died a natural death, anil Septimus Dorset might lmve met with his death In? ni4�ir)pntnllv fnllinn into t lie* shaft, uf 

 the blow-hole ; they were twelve men of ordinary intelligence, and they spent hours in carefully considering the case, hut after all their deliberations they could not find it in their consciences to return other than an open verdict. A clever lawyer would no doubt ha\\e elicited a good deal more from Miss Ballantyne; but she was evident ly ill a weak state of health and much distressed over the painful affair. The detectives did not press matters, for they were anxiously hunting for Mrs. Dalbe.rt, aud they intended to re serve their strength for tbe trial ; they had obtained two remands in the case of Setb Bos* dale, find bail wai refused. - In their experience, of crime and crimi nals they had never met with a more baffling case ; everything pointed to a carefully planned aud cleverly executed series ot crimes, and yet thtre was thuB far no actual proof that any crime had bern committed, and it was pos sible that even the arrest of Mrc. Dsl hnt might not yield any fresh material of importance. ' Probably also, there had never been 

 a case roorp exasperating 10 me puonc mind than this, in the criminal records, of the colonies. It was a mystery, of the first order, and most people wanted to prove that it was a criminal mystery, . bat unfortunately the evidence fell short. - .-However, tbe denthe of two men were to bo accounted for, and the police hoped that they could rake up sufScient evidence to convict Sttli Rosedale, so by dint of unusual effort they secured his committal for trial at the ensuing quarter sessions, and not only the legal world, but' the general public awaited anxiously the outcome ? of the trial. Dr. Strong, Mi6S Ballan tyne, Grace Strong, the Rev. Cliris . topbef Broadfacp, Donald Dorset, and a number of other witnesses, were - served with Subpoenas to appear and f'vc-evid.ence,' The our thing which especially irrit ated the curiops was that the subtcr ^anrpue caves, etc., below Sea-cliff � Towers, *er� not accessible to oui wfora.

 The. police Wrre the only persons who were allowed access to die rooms as sociated with the mystery, and Wil iam was occupied for days logi-tlier in dtfendiug the place against crowds of reporters acd photographprs and curious'individuals who came prepared with flash lights and all otber necessary appliances to take photographs of the bedroom, and lift, and caves, and even the subterranean blow-holf, and great wa8 their astonishment and indignation at being met with a refusal. As it was, exterior photographs of Miss Ballentyne's iuheritence appeared in every illustrated journal in the colonies, and any fresh news concerning ' The Mystery of Sra-clifl Towers ' proved thn best means, for weeks, of working off a late edition of the evanine papers. Dr. Strong and the Towers house 

 hold wore all of opinion that both Raymond Ballentyne and Septimus Dorset had met their deatlis by unfair means. But the proof was wantinf, and indeed also the motive to a crime on the part of Setli Rosedale, so in bis own quiet way Dr. Strong set himself to discover more about the matter. CHAPTER XXIII. Beatrice akd the Doctor. It was no doubt a 'angled skein that Dr. Strong had set himself to unravel, but he had several powerful iucentivpa to perseverance. He had only narrow iy escaped with his own life, for the hand that bound him when unconseious wouid undoubtedly, but for Mrs. Dal bert, have left him there to die. Then, too, hia interest in Miss Bal lentyne urged liim'to seriously attempt the solution of the mystery, and once set upon it be found to his intense, satisfaction that the Mietrrss of tbe 

 Towers was just as eager to outain tlie solution of the mystery as himself and that the pursuit brought him into very close and confidential intercourse with her. Hnppy is the lover who can find a common subject of study or pursuit with the mistress of his heart. Es pecially if its character is such as to lead iier to defer to his judgment and experience, and cause her to look to him for continual advice and guidance. This was the presont state of p.ffsirB at the Towers, for both Beatrice, Grace, and the doctor had committed them stlvcs to the investigation of tbe mystery ; but it wrs Miss Ballnntyne and the doctor who were the real prin cipals in the inquiry. It was a very good thing for Bea trice that events had so turned onr, for in tbe doctor she had one. to relieve her mind to in regard to tbe part she bad played in the ca6e of Sej-tiuius Dorset. ' Did it never occur to you that Mr. 

 jjorset may nav; imu lar uiu knowledge of affairs down bc-r� thau | be told you of ? '' asked the doctor the following aftprnoon of Beatrice. MifS Ballantyne had been telling Dr. Strong whit she coulJ remember 

 ot ncr interviews wiiii isupuiiius jjur si t, nnd she recalled the feeling which she bad, at the time, of something hav ing been kept back by him. -! My 0*n opinion,1' said Dr. Strong, ' is that there has bocn a deeply laid plot, extending back over a number of years, and r.bat the death of Septimus Dorset was almost as essential to its success as that of your uncle Raymond. I would very much like to see this Seth Rosedale ; if he. is the chief actor in this tragic Beries of crimes he must be a remarkably clever and accom plished criminal ' Beatrice felt that the doctor was avoiding any reference to her own share in the tragic end of the lawyer, aud hankered, with feminine perti nacity, for some expression of opinion from him. ' Whit do you think /should have done, doctor, when I discovered that there was a secret lift in the north bed room 1 ' she asked. ' Under tbe citcnruFtanccfi it was most difficult to know what to have done. You bad no Iriend to ask ad vice of except your lawyer, and be did not prove himself exactly a friend, nor as open end candid in regard to your late uncle's affairs as he might have been. It would no doubt have been 

 ueiwr uua you uayc wurut-u mui, ur in someway have put him upon bis guard ; but as a lawyer he ought to liave been upon his guard, especially knowing what be did about the place and its surroundings, and your uncle's relations wilb Mrs. Dalbsrt.' ' You do not blame me then for bringing him out here that night,' said Beatrice softly. ' No, I don't,' said tbe doctor stout ly, 'at least not under the circum stances, lie knew that be had a difficult case in band, and should have been upon his guard. Do you think that when a doctor is called in to at tend some bard case that he is met with a cautio.i to be upon his guard and protect himself against contagion ; not ajbit of it. he lias tbe case in hand professionally and takes lue risk.' ' Beatrice felt that there was a bit of sophistry in this special pleading of the doctor's, but it pleased her. She felt too, that he, at any rate, was on her side, and something told her that he would think little of risking his life for her. In fact he was to bo trusted out and out. \\To he continued..] The Postmaster-General is in receipt of information from the authorities at Adelaide that in consequence of bush fires over 200 polos have been burnt I flown between 'Overland Corner and Renruark.
