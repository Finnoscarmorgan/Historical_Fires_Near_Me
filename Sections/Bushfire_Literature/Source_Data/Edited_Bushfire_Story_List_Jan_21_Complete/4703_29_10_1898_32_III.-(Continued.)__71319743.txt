 CHAPTER III.-(Continued.). 

 Ana suca, stories he could tell. The gift had surely been born with him. There was no sub ject on land or sea he could not hold one breath less upon for an hour. Stories-some of them strong of the soil, of burning days and fiery nights on the great blank plain of the centre; of sheep, creeping with lolling tongues and patient eyes for miles and miles and miles through sun ravaged country, and lying down to die just before the water and green pastures were reached; of desperate fights with bush fires; of the queer ways of aboriginals; of the wild loy of drafting scrub cattle; of hunting kangaroo; of feats of swift shearing, of branding. Strange that, soul sickened as he was of it all, he could delve back into it and Arid fascination and glory in the re 

 count. 

 He told them once, carried away by his own eloquence, it was the only life in the world for 

 a man. 

 "Then why did you leave .it?" Bert said, "dis contentedly. He could find no enthusiasm for this monotonous life of picking at the earth, and would have had Peterson vault into a saddle and go back to the greenness of those other days. 

 But there came to the man the memory of the monotony of them-of the taste of ashes his mouth had held. 

 "Oh, damn it all!" he said, with sudden Are, and forgetful that the little gaping ears beside him Avere those of Mary's children. 

 Bert looked startled. Dorrie laughed, but made a mental marginal note to the effect that her mother must not be told of the slip. 

 "You are a queer man," she said. Then, confi dentially, and edging away from her small bro ther's hearing, "Do you know I was beginning to think that you didn't know any swear words." 

 He looked at her helplessly. 

 "Do you know many?" she pursued. "Isn't lt * s'prising what lots there are? Do you know 

 'darn my buttons]' and. .'bli' me?' I've just learnt those-not that they're so very bad. Of course mother doesn't know." 

 But the dull, burnt eyes looked at her with horror. He remembered the little nursery gov erness's dainty speech and purity of phrase. 

 "If ever," he said, "I hear you say a word you shouldn't, I'll march you straight off to your mo ther and ask her to whip you. I didn't think you were such a wicked little girl." 

 "Why," said Dorrie, "I don't think that's much. You hear worse than that wherever you walk. I take no notice of it." She smiled amusedly. 

 But his eyes glowed still more warmly. 

 "If ever," he said, "if eyer I hear one of those fellows say a word he shouldn't, I'll knock his head off-or if I say a word myself." The thought of his own vocabulary made him sud denly nervous and humble. 

 It was from that date therefore he constituted himself the keeper of the tongues of Bert and Dorrie- more especially Dorrie. 

 CHAPTER. IV. 

 There was extreme gloom on Dorrie's face, her . eyes were cast down, no wrds were on lier lip'-; she walked across the rough ground with so de jected an air that Bert's plastic soul felt flattened 

 with oppression. 

 "Don't frink about them, Dorrie dear," he beg ged; "then you'll forget them. Frink you're ray white charger, an' I'm a king; let's, play them there bushes are enemies, and we're just geln' to dash froo." 

 Dorrie raised her brroding eyes for one half sec 

 ? .? ond. 

 "'Them there's very bad grammar, Bert," she said. "Wilkinson's Ann says 'them there.' You've go to say 'these.' " . 

 "Those," : amended Bert; "and the littlest l-t of bushes Is the frird .battalion, and we're goin* to smash it up to smifereens, eh? Come on, Dor 

 rie. 

 Dorrie's mouth pursed. '"We'd got our good clothes torn," she said, "They're kangaroo apple 

 bushes." 

 Bert's blue eyes started at her. He stopped prancing; he brought the arm he had waved aloft in king-like fashion down to the level of his other 

 one. 

 "I don't frink we would, Dorrie," he said, af ter a pause; " 'T least, only a teeny blt." 

 "Well," said Dorrie morosely, "at all events, I'd get'my face hot with running." . 

 Bert's soft little mouth opened baby fashion, as |f to help his eyes to stare. 

 "What say?" he said. 

 "I'd get my face hot," repeated Dorrie; "it would perspire; look at the sun." 

 With his customary obedience. Bert looked, and when he found it was not rolling visibly about 1n the sky, or doing anything else extraordinary, he blinked back tearfully at his sister. "What's the matter with lt?" he said. 

 Dorrie strode on. "I might get a freckle on my nose," she said darkly. 

 Then he understood her mood, and looked help lessly at her boots. "Oh, I frlnk you might stop frinking about them," he said. "There'll be no time left. We'v got to weed the carrots, and you've got your 'clensions to learn. Smallest said we could only be out an hour. Let's start an' make a gold mine." 

 Dorrie poked him with her thin, sharp elbow. 

 "That's the third time you've said "Smallest,' this afternoon," she said. "I shall have to tell mother of you." 

 Bert looked ready to cry. "It's not my fault, Dorrie," he said. " 'Twasn't me made you have to wear them. Oh, you might be nice; 'sides, frink how much better it is for the skeeters and sand flies net to be biting away. at you." 

 He held out one of his own scratched, swol len little legs to illustrate how much better she fared. ' 

 But she looked at lt enviously "I'd rather have ten million sand flies," she said. 

 "Le's dig," said Bert, eagerly-the tone of voice had been her own again. "Le's aig mines just here; shouldn't you frink, Mr. Alkali Ike, there's nuggets knocking round. Why, what's this? Here's the gold plant growing like mad all over. 

 But Dorrie would not respond to the name she 

 Mr. J. Bland Holt. 

 Mr. and Mrs. Bland Holt have been for so long familiar, figures to Australian playgoers that their latest portraits require ho introduction '. ' 

 After a successful season in' Sydney, the popular manager and his wife, with the members of the company, left for Melbourne ""'??^? 

 on October'22 to open a season there in the finely-staged drama, "Sporting Life." \\J flJ - � 

 Mrs. Bland Holt. 

 had once chosen to be called by; she pushed her yellow curls off her shoulders and remarked lan guidly that the plant growing like mad was mal 

 ?lee. 

 Then Bert gave up in dispair. He sat down on a hillock of earth and wept silently for a minute or two, with his jacket sleeve at h's ej es. He .could never remember so spoilt a play time in his life. Dorrie was the mest wonderful little mate in the world. 

 She waited in perfect silence for him to finish, waited with her eyes on her respectable boots. Every hateful inch of their shiny -leather, each lace hole, every rib of the black stockings were photographed in her mind, 

 "When people begin to wear boots and stock ings," she said, 'they can't be nice any longer. They have to be always thinking of grammar and freckles and things." 

 Then the gcod, obedient little soul of Bert fell 

 into temptation. 

 "Dorrie," he said. 

 Dorrles eyes snapped, but she did not lock at 

 ? him.'- ' 

 "How'd it be, Dorrie," he whispered, "if you slipped 'em eff for just one little play?" 

 Neither of them looked at each other; Dorrie's left hand went down and untied a boot, but the right ene followed after and helped to tie it again. "You see I promised Smallest," she said gloom 

 ily 

 But the next moment both hands rushed down and pulled a lace in and out, in and out to the bott'im. Off flew the boat; down went the stock ing; a little, hard leg was gloriously bare onco 

 more; 

 "I won't take them off," repeated Dorrie, "that was what I promised, wasn't it?. But she didn't even ask me not to take ene off." She danced about; quite happy again; she hrpped on the bare 

 one, caressed it, patted it, strrked it. She called, on it to go and kick the stockinged one. 

 "L�e's go and see Pe'ereon and the other fel lows a AW," 'Bert �a-id. She had ref used before, be ing unwilling to be disgraced just yet before all 

 her old .friends. 

 "Come on," said the little wild one, darting on 

 ahead. 

 Sh.9 was down among a group of imen.exchanging greetings, parrying questions, long before the slo wer travelling Bert arrived, her shoe and stock ing safe within the loose front of .his sailor 

 blouse. 

 "They were six and frepence," he muttered, going back for them. "Smallest couldn't afford 

 them again." 

 "Dorrie's clothed leg was hidden In som� mar vellous fashion up her frock. Standing on her one ibare one ehe looked to the men just like the little friend who had come and chatted with them al most every morning for six or seven years. 

 "Get all your leesons done?" said Peterson. 

 "All but 'traibs, trabte,' " answered Dorrie; "I've that to do when I go in. Spell 'harass,' Peter 

 son." 

 Peterson stopped digging, scratched his head, rubbed his nose, and finally spelt dt with two 

 "r's." 

 She chuckled, and asked iNo-nose Adams for embarrass. It went right across the creek and back again, and no one got lt right. "You're getting too much of a scholar for .us, (Dorrie," Peteraon said, "there's no keeping up with you." 

 Dorrie gave them the catch rhyme. She called painstakingly up and down the little line of wash ers, and made them repeat it each and each in 

 turn. 

 One In harass, two in embarrass, ? 

 But both, I confess, must have double s. 

 No-nose Adams said it with admiration, for It plainly expre-sed: on his vacuous face. "It's a won'ful thing," he said. 

 "Well, spell 'harass' now, quickly," said Dorrie, tripping him up swiftly. And he floundered into a mire that held two r's, one s, and no h. 

 When they wearied of 'orthography, and had done their very .best with seven nine's and eight .seven's, and listened patiently to the fact that ''wheat cairne originally from Egypt, and was .brought to Marseilles before the Romans had pene trated Into Gaul," �ert was in demand. . 

 Ho spelt book and oven and dish for them; he added 4 and 5 together, took away 3, and found tl,3 answer 6, amidst great applause. He 

 told them that a noun was the name of anything -as soldier, horse. 

 . "Or nugget, quartz, pickaxe," supplemented 

 Dorrie. . . 

 Then Adams swung the little lad up on the broad branch of a low tree on the bank, and at the well-known signal the washers all stopped work. One raked dried wood together, lit a fire, and slung on a couple of billies. The others took their pipes from their mouths, sat down on the ground, and took hunches of bread and meat or ^cheese from their pockets. Dorrie put her leg* carefully under her, and sat in the midst of 

 them. ? V:'--..... 

 "Fire away," said Peterson, dipping his tin mug into the little billy that boiled first. 

 'King Henry of Navarre?" said the little boy. 

 "No," said Adams, "we had that yesterday; and the day before, and ain't forgot about that game, little ship, hev y er?" 

 Jones nodded, approval. "Bloomin' good pome 

 that there." - 

 Jones's mate drank a pannikin of tea with a loud throat noise. He hit the ground with the empty tin, and his lips opened and shut. "An' 'e said, 'fight on, fight on,' " he muttered; "an' 'e said, fight on.' " 

 "Oh," said Dorrie, "have something shorter. ; T want to hear hear about Henderson and Gaff ney fighting each other last night; that thing's so blooming long." 

 Peterson allowed his tea to become a drowning place for buzzing flies. He crossed over to tho little girl- "Off you go home," he said, 'scoot along; you've been here quite long enough." 

 . Dorrie held fast to the earth with her hands. "I won't say it again; it slipped out," she said. "Oh, please let me stay, Peterson." 

 "Let her stop," said Adams, " 'twas my fault." 'I've let you off twice," said Peterson; "skip a'o�is: home this time." 

 "Oh," said Dorrie; "please be nice, Peter. I do beg your pardon, and I won't : say it again, true's as I live." 

 "But you said that before," said Peterson. 

 Dorrie patted his hand affectionately. "Go and drink your tea, Peter," she said; "there's a bulldog crawling up the side, and it won't taste nice in a minute." 

 "Stop gassin,'" said Jones's mate, "and let the little lad start, for"-he sought assiduously amongst his words for an inoffensive noun-"for hookey's sake." 

 Then Into the requested silence ran the thin, eager, flexible voice of the boy. 

 How it lingered over the words, how it mouthed the brave speeches, how it hurried and trembled 

 along the exciting bits! 

 "Sir Richard spoke and he laughed, and we roared a hurrah, and so-" 

 Quite as a chorus came the next line, the men all knew it and loved it as well as the boy, and absolutely could not refrain from "chipping in," 

 as Dorrie expressed it. 

 And so :' 

 The little Revenge ran on sheer tinto the heart ot. the 

 foe. 

 Then alone once more rushed on the eager 

 voice 

 Fousands of their soldiers look'd down from their 

 decks, and laughed : 

 Fousands of their seamen made mock at the mad lit 

 tle craft. 

 Peterson's pipe went out, No Nose Adams puff ed laboriously; there were tears of enthusiasm in the eyes of Jones and Jones's mate. Dorrie alone chewed a bit of grass in perfect uncoricern, and felt glad for every verse that was finished, since it brought her nearer to hearing about Gaffney, who had stolen Henderson's loin of mut ... ton-: : . ?

 And the sun went down and the stars came out,'far 

 over the summer. sea, . , . ? . ? i 

 But never . a moment ceased the fight of the one and 

 fifty free. , 

 Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high built 

 galleons came;. ..>?..?. . 

 Ship after, ship, the whole night long, with her battle 

 funder and flame; 

 Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back ..with 

 her dead and her shame, . ' ' :' ??r'' 

 For some were sunk, and many were scattered, and so 

 could fight us no more. .([ ,.; . 

 God of battles, was ever a battle like this .in,the 

 world before? , . .. I . 

 The young voice gasped, excitement had dried the .little swelling throat. 

 Adams plunged forward with his pannikin. "Take a pull," he said, holding it out. 

 "'E likes more sugar," said Jones's mate, has tening up with his little newspaper packet and 

 emptying it all in. 

 Then refreshed Bert ran on again; his short, fat legs dangled from the branch; one hand grasp ed the overhanging bough, the other went to help the declamation. Such a red little face he '?had!' ???'?' ' 

 But Sir Richard cried, In his English pride, - '. 

 We have fought such a fight for a day and'a night, ? As may never be fought again! " , 

 "We have won. great glory, my men! ... 

 And a day, less or more, 

 At sea or ashore, ..<?.., We die-does it matter when? 

 Sink me the ship, Master Gunner-sink her, split' 

 her.In twain! 

 Pall ilnto the hands of God-not into the hands of 

 Spain! " ? ' . 

 There came quite a ' groan of disappointment 

 from Jones's mate. 

 "There's the red 'andkerchief," he said. . 

 "Oh! darn lt all!" said Jones, "it wori'thurt to wait till the end; go it little 'un." 

 The "little 'un" had slithered from his pole, and was looking around doubtfully. 

 "Come on," said Dorrie, virtuously, "we must go." ? ? 

 "If I 'adn't seen th' 'andkerchief, you'd never a-saw it," Jones's mate said. "'Ow's yer mater say as'ow you've seed it yet?" 

 Bert's unwilling eyes went, over the flat lands to the tree clad hill rise, where the wave of co lor showed against the green. He looked bach at his friends, and Adams was looking sc de jectedly sorry his tongue picked up the theme 

 again." 

 And the gunner said, "Aye, aye," but the seamen 

 made reply. 

 "We have children, we have wives," ? .

 But Peterson lifted him up from the ground hy the back of his loose coat. 

 "Nick away," he said. "Now, Dorrie, off with you both this minute." 

 "Scoot along!" said Peterson; "look alive,, wo many! What are you doing with your leg? Has 

 tt gone to sleep?" 

 But Dorrie went hopping off in greatest haste. "Pm'pretending I'm a stork," she mumbled. 

 And stick In hand, progressed on her one bare leg till the bush shelter permitted thc use of
