A Whim of the Mistress. BY MARY HANNAY FOOT. 

 [ WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.] CHAPTER V.�THE LONG STIRRUP; THE LETTER; THE LIMESTONE CAVE. 

 

 On Easter Monday everybody at Wilga was up and doing before the stars were off the sky, and by sunrise Mr. Lanbranch had driven off for the Crossing, his coach in which he 

 was to drive parties of children to and from the picnic embowered in shining dark-green boughs of the wild orange, festooned about the box with the Union Jack�made for the occasion by Mrs. Lanbranch herself out of blue dungaree, turkey red twill, and white calico �and fluttering with numbers of little flags, and Spider, in bran-new cords, boots, and spurs and other regalia, riding alongside at a hand gallop. As soon as the five big even- tempered chestnuts had vanished at the turn of the down-river road in a cloud of red dust Wilga breathed again. As if by common consent a second breakfast (with time to sit down to it) was called for, served, and eaten in house and kitchen and at the overseer's cottage, where Bobby was staying with Mr. McNab. "Ye'll ixcuse me, Bohbby," said Mr. McNab, when he had finished his fourth chop and frugally picked the bone. "I have a wheen letters to write. Just you go on till ye're done. I'm gled to see," he added with an approving smile as he rose from the table, "that ye eat the faht as well's the lean." Mr. McNab had scarcely begun his letter writing at the small side table when Cubbie arrived at the door. "Mine been fetchum that f'llow Warlock," he announced. "Mitatie (the mistress) been yabber 'Which way Bobby?' " "Whit sahddle are ye puttin' on Warlock?" inquired Mr. McNab. "Saddle b'long me," replied Cubbie with an air of patronage. "Tak' it off his bahck!" commanded the overseer in a peremptory tone, "and"�point ing to his own saddle and bridle on a stand in the corner of the room�"put on yon." Cubbie obeyed in open wonder. For Mr. McNab's saddle and bridle�housed within doors in his own little sitting-room and kept in order and condition by his own hands�were looked upon by all who knew him as sacred things. When Mr. McNab arrived at the house with Bobby the old racehorse was standing saddled and bridled, his beautiful bay coat scarcely yet roughening for the winter, the small white spot on his lofty head shining like a star, his great brown eyes full of intelligence and kindli ness, as when a dozen years before Mr. Lanbranch had bought him in a Sydney sale- yard to save him from ending his days in the cab ranks. Mrs. Lanbranch, as she stood in the veranda watching the preparation for Bobby's riding lesson, thought of the day when her husband had first brought Warlock home, and of how their little lost boy, then 4 years old, had let go her hand and gone with his father to be lifted into the saddle and sit for a moment or two on the great steeplechaser's back, and remembered how fond he had always been of Warlock up to the time, two years later, when he was taken away from them for ever. Cubbie stood at the horse's head, devoured the while by doubt as to whether that position or the offlce of putter-up was the more impor tant one. At last he decided that the one of which he would be able to hold longest tenure was the post for him. "You puttem up that fellow Bobby, Mr. McNab," he said. But Mr. McNab had other ideas. "Tek a grup of the pommel with ye'r left hahnd, Bohbby," he said, "and steek ye'r left fet in the sturrup, an' fling ower ye'r right." But Bobby was already in the saddle, seated erect and square, the bridle-reins caught deftly as with accustomed fingers, and his hand held low on the wither. Warlock advanced a few paces. Bobby checked him gently, and in the delibe rate way in which he did everything stooped over on one side and the other, and let out the leathers to a length which amazed his intend ing instructor. Cubbie laughed aloud. "My word, Bobby!" he exclaimed good-naturedly, "you close-up gentleman, mine think-it. Plenty you wantum 'tirrup, all the same Mithter Lanbranch." Mr. McNab heard a gasping sound at his side �a sound that was almost a sob. He glanced at Mrs. Lanbranch as she stood close by, her face white, her eyes filled with tears, her hands clasped together. "It is impossible!" she murmured�"impos sible." "My poor leddy," said Mr. McNab in a tremulous voice, "my dear leddy�there's One, ye mind, with whom 'all things are pohs sible'," 

 Shortly afterwards the Paroo mailman appeared at the turn-off, on his way from the Crossing to the Lagoon on the Queensland boundary. "Thaht will do now, Bohbby," said Mr. McNab, and Bobby dismounted and led Warlock back to the starting place without a word or sign of demur. "The Dundohnald's a grahnd plaoe for rich men's only sons," muttered the overseer, "a grahnd, grahnd place!" and carrying with him his cherished saddle and bridle he returned to his cottage to finish his letters. "Bobby will not be home to lunch, Mr. 

 McNab," said Mrs. Lanbranch, as he was about to go. "I have promised to take him with me to the Swan-swim. Come, Bobby," she con tinued, turning to the boy, "I am going over to the store to get some things for a picnic. You have lost one picnic, you know, through coming here to spend your holiday with me, so I must see whether I can give you another pic nic instead. Yes. Cubbie, you may come too," she added, replying to a wistful look of the tracker's. The store, which was a new building, put up within the last year or two, was stocked with all sorts of good things in the way of jams, preserved fruits and meats, and other dainties, aa well as with ordinary rations, clothing, 

 pipes, tobacco, saddlery, tools, and quantities of goods besides; but the things which seemed to take Bobby's attention more than any of the others were a roll of canvas kept for making hammocks and water-bags, and a hank of sew ing twine which hung on a nail beside it with two or three sail-needles and a saddler's palm. "Did you learn to sew when you were on the ship, Bobby?" asked Mrs. Lanbranch. "Sit down on the soap-box there, and I will sit here awhile and rest�and, Cubbie, here is some tobacco for you, and go now and tell Brown to fetch the waggonette along store." Then as Cubbie disappeared she added, "While 

 we are waiting, Bobby, you may as well tell me about the training ship, and what you learned there, and what you sewed, and where you went. Did you ever go anywhere out of the ship, Bobby?" And Bobby said, "Yes. To the old woman's place�Granny's, where Nancy died�and to the Islands." "When�when Mr. Lanbranch comes home, Bobby," said Mrs. Lanbranch, "will you tell him about poor Nancy?" Bobby nodded. "And now will you tell me about what you did at the Islands." And Bobby told of the stricken shell-backs and of the daily task he had shared with the sailmaker. By-and-by the waggonette came to the store 

 door, and Bobby carried out to it the materials they had chosen for their picnic, and then, dis missing Brown, Mrs. Lanbranch took the reins, and with Bobby seated beside her drove river ward to the Swan-swim. Meanwhile Mr. McNab completed his letter, wrote out a telegram in addition, and sent them both, to be despatched from the office on Queensland boundary, by the Paroo mailman. Both letter and telegram were addressed to "Miss Lanbranch, 2 Macarthur-square, Sydney." The telegram contained these words:�"Await letter this date before leaving. All well here. Clue." The letter ran thus :�� Dear Madam, �Mailman waiting, so please excuse brevity. Find out from training-ship Dundonald history boy Bobby last year placed with Winter, lessee of punt, Kombo's Crossing. Same Winter was stockman in charge out-station Swan-swim ten years ago. boy here on visit�a whim of the Mistress �said last night she thought must be Winter's son, reported dead years ago. If W.'s son, should be able to recollect in time whether R.L. was at the hut that day before W.'s wife (his mother) left it. Just now, though, he is not all there�not so much wanting perhaps as backward. Spare no cost, I would strongly advise, and lose no time. Wire to me through some Queensland office. Fear rumours Crossing raise false hopes here. �Yours respectfully, Andrew McNab. Bobby enjoyed his day at the Swan-swim as he had never, to his own remembrance, enjoyed any day of his life before. He ate heartily, but by no means greedily, of the unaccustomed dainty fare, and to all appearance was if anything more engrossed with the scenery and the surroundings than with his store of biscuits, fruit, and sweets. The lake-like expanse of the river was calm and clear, and its margin and islets were green and gay with the reeds and rushes and waving grasses and the spreading water weeds with their star-like small flowers. Myriads of wild fowl swam at peace in the glassy stream or waded in the shallows or poised themselves on the branches of the forest trees, whilst every now and then a flight of small birds made rapid passage from bush to bush. Mrs. Lanbranch gazed on it all with mourn ful eyes. By-and-by she lost herself in reverie. Bobby began to gather the small white immortelles that grew about, then wandered further away in quest of other flowers. After a while he came to a little limestone rise, which is the only outcrop of the limestone close to the river from the Fisheries to White Ridges. Giant marsh-mallow sprang everywhere around, and wild myrtle bushes and sandalwood grew in dense clumps here and there. One of these �a thicket almost of the feathery sandalwood� had grown amid the fallen timbers of a mighty tree, whose charred trunk and stump seemed to show that it had been overthrown in some bush fire of long ago. Bobby paused awhile as if in thought, looked about as if recalling some half-forgotten land marks. Then, parting the bushes, he peered into an opening in the hillside disclosed to view, entered it, and some few minutes after wards returned and resumed his flower- gathering. Mrs. Lanbranch awoke from her musing, startled by the gentle touch of a hand on hers. She looked up. Bobby knelt on the grass at her feet. His blue innocent eyes were gazing fondly into her face. It was the timid touch of his brown work-worn fingers that had recalled her from her dream. He was offering her a bunch of wild flowers such as a child might bring. In the evening after supper at the cottage Bobby suddenly remarked to Mr. McNab: "I will ask for the Jack that is on the coach. I will sew a sail for the little shell-back."
