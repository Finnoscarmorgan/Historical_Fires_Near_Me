An Eve of Fire.

 SUCH a hot summer it had been ; only re- deemed from dire drought by fierce, passing thunderstorms. On New Year's Eve, all day long a lurid cloud of smoke from the dreaded bush fires had hung over the se- lection whereon stood the four-roomed hut which was the home of stalwart Jim Brideson, his wife, and five bairns. First of these was Letty, a grave little maiden aged twelve, "mother's girl" ; then Dick, aged ten, quite a big fellow, and father's right hand. Tom and Bob, merry little pickles of seven and four ; and Pearlie, the baby, with milk-white skin, rosy cheeks, and eyes as blue as our sum- mer skies She could just walk and talk, too, the sweetest broken words you could imagine ; a tiny queen, was she, holding undisputed 

 sway. 

 Mrs. Brideson came to the door with the chiid in her arms, and looked anxiously across the paddocks at the dense cloud that loomed ever nearer and thicker. Now that evening was closing in, the cloud began to shoot great tongues of red and yellow flame ; and borne on the wind came a distant, unceasing roar like the crash of mighty breakers on a rock- 

 bound coast. 

 Brideson, and the rest of the men-folk in the neighbourhood, had been out all day en- deavouring to beat back the fire from their 

 hold. 

 "Father's late!'' said Mrs. Brideson to Letty, and her tone was full of sharp anxiety, though she strove not to let the children guess her fears. 

 " Maybe the fire's bested 'em, mother," chimed in Dick, eagerly and importantly, "I heerd father tell Bill Toomey this mornin' that once it crossed the road it 'ud go like hell." 

 " Dick !'' reproved mother with a warning glance at Tom and Bob, who were listening with open mouths, and privately making up 

 their minds to use swear words themselves as soon as ever they got a good chance. Mean- time they grinned approvingly. 

 " You bad, wicked children !'' cried Letty, pouncing upon them, " don't you know the fire's just like the Day of Judgment, when you'll all be burnt up alive if you don't be 

 good." 

 At this horrible presentation picture little Bob set up a howl, then sobbed frightfully, finally holding his breath till he grow black in the face, and had to be appeased by a large pint of sop, which Letty, as a token of her re- morse, allowed him to sweeten to his own li- king, whilst the others also ate their supper. Even mother tried to swallow a few mouthfuls as she hushed Pearlie to sleep, "for, perhaps,'' thought the woman, "I may need my 

 strength." 

 Then she and Letty put the younger children to bed, cleared away the tea things, washed up, and set the table again. Then, as father had not returned, Mrs. Brideson, Letty, and Dick went outside to see if there was anything more they could do to check the rush of the fire to 

 war is their home. 

 They drove the cows and calves, and the horses into the yards down near the creek, and enticed the pigs there also. 

 Then, with infinite toil, they carried buckets of water from the creek to fill every receptacle they could possibly make use of at the hut, and just as they finished, father returned. He was blackened and haggard, covered with sweat and grime, his clothes scorched, his limbs weary. 

 His wife ran to him. 

 "Oh, Jim, dear," she said. " Oh, Jim ! I'm glad you've come. Your tea's ready.'' 

 Then the woman swayed a bit, as though she was faint. Her husband put his arm about her, and for a minute her heart leapt against his own, then he said with a laugh, " Why, old woman, you're turnin' coward. S'pose yer thought I was burnt up ? Yer don't get rid of me quite so easy, I can tell yer. 

 When I seen we could do nothin' more with the fire I come home." 

 Then they went inside, and Brideson washed his face and hands, and had his tea, while Dick and Letty crouched on the verandah, cold fear gathering swiftly at their hearts as they watched the great cloud of flame coming nearer. The roar was now very terrible, and the crash of falling limbs sounded like the sharp rattle of musketry. 

 Don't you be afeard, Letty, I'll take care of yer,'' said Dick, consolingly, for the boy had the heart of a hero, though he was only a little bush-bred son of Australia ; and Letty, not to be behindhand in courage, as becomes Austra- lia's daughters, bravely wiped her tears away. 

 The scrub on the edge of the clearing, be- yond a ploughed field, was now one sheet of raging flame towering toward the sky. The air grew so thick and sulphurous they could hardly draw their breath, and showers of sparks from time to time flew right over the hut. 

 " Now, lad !'' said Brideson to Dick, as he hoisted the boy up on to the roof, " I'll keep the water goin' as long as I can ; you, mother, and Letty keep the roof damp, and beat out the sparks wherever they settle.'' 

 And then, God help them, how they worked, 

 fighting the Demon of Fire for possession of their little homestead ; these poor people, whose very lives swayed on the balance. 

 Through blinding, suffocating, smoke they still fought desperately on, but the flames swept over them like tin fierce scirocco's breath; they gasped, they grew faint, they felt that 

 they must die. 

 " It's no use, wife !" cried Brideson at last, and exhaustion made him reel like a drunken man. " We must get to the creek.'' He rushed into the bedroom and caught up his bonnie little lads, and his wife's trembling arms clasped her baby close. Dick grasped Letty's hand, and they all ran�ran for dear life�pursued by the leaping flames. 

 They fled down to the yards where the stock 

 had been shut in. The cows and calves were bellowing fearfully as they and the horses rushed round in extremity of terror, the pigs adding to the uproar by frantic squeals. Their owners released the animals, and all rapidly made for the creek. Round about the yards the ground had been cleared for a considerable distance, and was at present bare of grass. Nothing remained to carry the fire out but a few shade trees, whose bushy leaves seemed already shrivelling in the scorching wind. Only a few days before Brideson and his wife had been lamenting the scarcity of herbage this side the creek, but now it proved their last hope. Between the stockyards and the water was a large potato patch, and over this they desperately stumbled, beating out the sparks that fell on their clothing as they ran. 

 They reached the creek. Fortunately there was plenty of water in it, and the steep banks 

 afforded them some shelter from the breath of 

 the flames. 

 A shovel was in the potato patch. Brideson went back for it, and then under the bank of the creek he dug a wide, shallow hole wherein his wife placed the three younger children, covering them with a wet blanket ; and there these hardy little sons and daughter of the bush were soon slumbering again, as peacefully as though there wore no such things as woe 

 and disaster in the world. 

 The rest of the family, for minutes that seemed like hours, huddled together under another wet blanket ; stolidly indifferent now to all but the preservation of their lives. 

 They doubted not but that their home and its many home comforts, which they through years of toil had won from the wild, was a heap of ashes, but mercifully it was not so. 

 As Brideson stooped to wet the blanket again a strong wind smote him in the face. 

 He gave a hoarse shout of joy. 

 "Oh, wife ! Wife ! The wind has changed.'' And so it had. Bidding Letty remain with 

 the children, the parents, hope again nerving their arms, and bravely assisted by Dick, who, in his relief, had almost forgotten, poor little chap, that he was dead beat, soon had their homestead fairly secure. Happily a well- grassed paddock that had been "saved up" on the other side of the creek was not much harmed. When New Year's morning dawned 

 they turned their stock therein, and though the damage done by the fire to their property was very great, still their hearts were full of thankfulness that the New Year had not found them utterly ruined and homeless. 

 The change of wind, too, had brought up a heavy storm of rain, so that practically all need 

 of anxiety was over. 

 The fine potatoe crop was but little injured. When Mrs. Brideson had attended to the all-important plum pudding, she dug some po- tatoes for dinner ; and Bobbie, as he picked them up and put them in a bucket, said 

 gravely : 

 " Mummy, what a dood thing they isn't all 

 cooked.''
