THE SKETCHER. 

 THE ELLIOT FAMILY. 

 By M. FORREST. 

 There were 14 in the family, so their mother informed the boarders at Mrs. An- struther's. Fortunately, she only brought seven to town with her, that was quite enough. 

 They were all "lint-locked" and freckled with the exception of Lizzie, the eldest, who had some rudiments of a complexion in spite of being reared on home-made 

 "soda" bread and salt beef. 

 They owned a grazing,ia�n ouLJieyond. Charleville, and had come to the city for a holiday�that is the.mother and^jguds bad come," the fattaraud "ihe boyk^-fe^ mained on the selection to look after the stock and to put out bush fires. .J - V -

She seemed to have endured all the troubles the flesh is heir to�with others peculiar to herself�with -amlizilijg fortitude, "up there,"'as she always desig nated her home. i .... - 1 

 Mrs. Raympnd noticed that Lizzie jrau 

 dered round flie house with a stunip �it. lead pencil in one hand and some remnants of torn backs of envelopes in the other, on which she apparently jotted down notes. �. 

 Being a writer herself War}' Raymond was curious enough to mquire of Mrs. Elliot if her daughter composed, , ; 

 "Lor, no! Though � don't say she couldn't if she cared io bother pbout it. Liz was always the scholar of the family, but what with 0 little sister or 'brother' coming every year, and:me .so helpless, obp has had berhahdsfulk" - 

 "Oh! I thought, seeing her carrying writing materials about with her, that she W43 putting

 "No, indeed; that's a subscription-list she is getting up for her brother Tim. Poor fellow! He wants a rifle so badly to shoot wallabies with.

It was such a surprise to every one, but, of course, after their being so kind, he hadn't the heart to return the money, though one of the storekeepers, just by wayof a joke, you knowf said he nught have offered to, but my husband is that sensitive' he Wouldn't hurt the feelings of. a bandicoot!

 Mrs. Raymond pVomised to head the list for'lhe rifle fyhd.ahd to see what she could do in The matter: "Her husband remarked some months lat�*vwith unnecessary can dour, that fools rush in where angels fear td tread.' Eventually Mrs. Raymond heartily agreed with hhn. '
