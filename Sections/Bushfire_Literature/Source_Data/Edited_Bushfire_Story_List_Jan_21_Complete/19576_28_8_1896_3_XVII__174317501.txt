 \\ Sko gave u sigh, and lior astonishingly j young face scorned for a moment to If raw ay old na its years. Olaro had heurd thai the ' one ohild of Gladys's marriage lniddicdnsn haby, and pressed her friend's hand sym pathetically, saying nothing. Mr. Chance s shuttling footstep sounded on tho voraiula, and presently lie cumo in, carrying two grout bulging saddle bugs, with the French heel of 

 one kid shoe and tlio buckled too of unotuor peeping out at the aperture beneath tho flap. He deposited these on tho floor, and stood looking at Mrs. Hilditcli with a sort ofsatur- nino tondornoss. Fair Tncs hud come and conquered, and old Cyrus hud found the embodiment of his romantic dreams in this dainty creature from a world that ho knew not. "I'm thinking," ho said, "that I'd better be gotting down to my enmp." "Oh, Mr. Chance," cried Clare, "don't fo yot. Have some of my tea : and, besides, haven't half thanked you for bringing mo my friend. I don't think I'll try ; you can see what a pleasure you have givon me." Tho muscles nbout old Cyrus's mouth relaxed into an expression of benovolenco. "Didn't I toll you," ho answered, " that ye might apply to mo in a difficulty � short of a money one� and I'd see what I could do for you?" "I don't think miieli of you if you wouldn't help me in a money difficulty," said Gladys. " It's an ill business to lieg, to borrow, or tolond," said old Cyras sontontiously. " Oh, ho's a miser, isn't ho ? " said Gladys, boldly. ' That's what they told mo at Cedar Hill. And lio's enormonsly rich, and could . buy us nil out and have a decent competence over. Isn't that so ? " " To buy us out wouldn't be saying a great deal," answered Mrs. Trogasldss. " To buy yon out, Gladys, would bo a different matter." "My husband left me five thousand a year," said Mrs. Hilditcli, gravely : " nnd if I marry again I loso ovnry penny of it." " Then take the advico of old man Chance, leddy, and keep your liberty and your siller. True enough Fm a miser and a woman liater, but I'd have been worso than that if I hud ' given a woman tho right to pnt her hand in my pooket, for I'd have boon a beggar. No, I thank you, Mistress Tregnskiss," refusing : Clara's proffered enp of tea, " I'll be having , it at the camp presently. Is tho master on ' tho place?" "Ho wont out on the run with Mr. Shand," ; she answered, ' 1 bnt he ought to ho coming back now. I think I hear thedogs barking." "Then I'll. be saying good-night," said Cyrus. ' Gladys turned a puzzled look upon him. \\ "Mr. Tregaskiss isn't a. woman," shocriod. , <t Why do you want to run away from him ? What does he mean by his oump, Olaro ? Does ' he prefer camping to Bleeping in a bouse, or am I turning him out here ?" Old man Cyrus Chance prefers to sloop . and eat at his own expense," putin Chance. "I'm not saying that I don't tako n meal off a neighbour's corncobs or a pumpkin that wonld rot for want of gathering, but that's not a question of hospitality. Good-night, leddy. Tho rest of your pock is on the buck veranda, and I hope you'll not And any of your gewgaws missing." " Listen !" said Gladys. "When he knows tliut half of them are completely ruined, and that Parker would die at tho sight of my crumpled teaguwns. Two pairs of niy best silk stookiugs are ornuuieuting the gum trees, and tho Valenciennes frills uf my petticoats torn to shreds and strewing the plain. The pack horse put down his head and kioked up his legs, and then bolted. Away went tliu paek, and the black hoys gathered up tho fragments." " Silk gowns and fripperies and fallals, the Hko of which was never seen on the Leuru 1" said Mr. Chance. "Yon are u deal too fine for these parte, leddy. But Iwould not have it altered. You're good to look at, and not to bo confounded witli the ordinary; und your finery is just part of yourself." " Hear him. I'm converting him already. Mr. Chance, have you forgotten that I'm a woman?" "Eli, but you and mistress tboro ore a dif ferent brand from thoso other croutures of women, nnd not to be drafted into the same yard. I don't count ye as women." "That's the prettiest compliment I've ever had paid mo," returned Gluuys, und elie held out her hand to liiin with suoh royal grace that old Cyras was obliged to tako it and perforin u very awkward bow in doing so over her outstretched fingers. " Where's your oump going to he, Mr. tlhaiicn?" she asked. " Agcn tho watorhole, oloso by the blacks. They're good company for me. I've got Andy off, mistress; It cost me a pretty pinny." "I shall oome down after dinner� or tea. I observe that ull meals are tea horo, 'and we'll have another game of knuoklobones," said Gladys. " Knuoklobones 1" repeated Mrs. Tregas kiss. " It's his favourite dissipation ; haven't you discovered that ? He bus got the loveliest sot. I've always longed to play knuoklobones, and last night wlion we wore camping out he taught me ; I had some trouble to persundo him that it wus not dorogatory to my dignity us a woinim." "A woman!" grunted Cyrus, with an accent of contempt. " Huvon't I said I did not count you ? Tliey don'tknowyour brand up lioro." "A goddess then � without the pedestal. I have uo objeotion, Mr. Chuneo, to being a goddess since yen dcclino to piny knuuklo- bonos with ordinary mortals." ""Well, anjrhow," said Cyrus, "it's an innocent psBtimo, and tukes skill, and it's eheap." "And classic," added Gladys. "The Pompeiiuns placed knueklebonee. I've seen tho Beta � beauties, nearly eighteen hundred years old � in the Museum at Naples. You may disapprove of Mary Stuart and the Empress Theodora and Gibbon, and the rest of your aheap literature people, but you can't trample on tho Pompeiiuns� poor petrified corpses: thoy'ro too pathetio." The sounds of arrival beoamo pronounocd. dure Treguskins's still smile might liavo beon carved in marble. "This is Koith," sho said. " Keith I " repented Gladys. " Oh I for got. Your husband's nauio. I like it. I'm longing to see bira. It wasn't kind of you, dare, to moot, marry, and go off with him tliut year I was in Switzerland. I'vo ofton pictured to myself the kind of mnn for whom yon gave up all the joys of civilisation� bill nnd stately, brave, simple, tender� intellco- tiial, of coarse ; 'scorning the falsehoods and Insincerity; of society that you used to hold forth against; a sort of nature's king; u Strongman carving liis course, like a rivor and, muking everybody in thiBwild, queer C0iintry�-wliit08 and blaoks� rospeot and admire him. Yos, I know whut ho would bo lilco. And now I seo that I was quite . right." ... At her last words, old Cyrus, who had edged towards tho front veranda, realising , ithutun oxit by the buck would bring liim 'fiioa to face 'with Tregaskiss, paused und stood still, an expression of. grim astonisli- : nient on his features. Gladys wus peering out at tho Fronoh window, looking upon tho yard, and was taking stock of tho now romor. Olinuco and tilitrc both moved near . her, and glunoed over liar shoulder at tho . figure of a tall man standing by his horso and unstrapping his valiso. Ohuiico gavo a queer little ejaculation, and Clare's lips (tightened, hut she said nothing and turned i away. It was Goneste. In a moment he waB at tho door confront ing Gladys. She hold out her hand, lior 'beautiful face beaming and in her uuunor a 

 . mixture of the sweetest dignitj-nmd friend- in0fl3- ; ; i " I flon't need nny introduction to Clare's husband. I oau quite understand her not regretting the English life. I hope yon will wolcomo her old friend for hi-r sake. " Gladys," ClHro interposed. " I ought to have told you. This is not iny husband. It is our neighbour, Dr. Goneste." Sho .went forward with outstretohed band. "How do you do ? Wo are oxpeotmg Koitli. Let me . introduco yon to Mrs. Hilditch." Goneste made his greetings becomingly, and Gladys laughed at her mistake. But thora was an awed, almost terrified, look in lior eyes. Clare's composure had beon udmi- ruble, but Gladys's perceptions wore keen. When Tregnskiss arrived half an hour later, Mrs. Hilditcli was in hor room unpack ing tho saddlebags and otherwise preparing herself for ditinor. Clare was with her, and tlioir first intimation of the master's coming was not altogether nil agreeable one. Tre gaskiss was in an ill hnrauur; ho had seen his cattlo dying, boggod in tho fast emptying watorholes ; ho had had a longer ride than either Mr. Shand or his wife guessed, and not aftor stock ; on his way home there had been u stormy encounter with the drover of some travelling ntook, and ho hud discovered that a good doul of grass had been destroyed by a bush fire. Tommy George, who came out to take his liorso, was suspected of being the causo of this lost disaster through having carelessly thrown away a burning match whon lighting his pipe on the run. TVoguskiss attacked him, swore at him freely, ordered him to hund over liis pipe, which he broke into fragments and threw at him and gave Slmnd instructions that not another fig of tobacco was to ho served to the bluck- boys for a month to come. He fumed on in loud, wrathful accents. His horse had a sore hack, and 8nnnd oarao in for a share of blame for not having seen to the stuffing of tlio saddle. _ One of tho stockmen was waiting for rations. "Oh, eonfouud you!" said Tregaskiss, "I'm dog tired, and I'm not going to givo out rations at this hour. You can stop till Mr. Shand has turned out tho homos. Go after him to the yard and tell him. Or hero, Mrs. Tregaskiss will give them out. Clnro ! Gustn, go nnd nsk your mistress to come out to tho store." Clare did not wait for tho summons. She turned from hor occupation of hanging up eomo of Glady's drosses iu the cretonne cur tained wardrobe. " I will come back presently, Gladys," she said. "Yes Stay � Oh, Clare, was that � Mr. Tregaskiss f" " That was my husband," said Mrs. Tregiislrias stonily. "You will find him perhups a little different from whut yon ex pected � and from what he used to he� if Cassandra, who met him in England, ever described him to you; but you must re member wo lead a rough life, and ho hits beon riding after oaitle all day : und� nnd times are bad, nud it is not surprising that lie should bo tired mid a little irritable. Our cattle are dyiug for want of grass and wutor. and wlion you liuve been here a little vliilo you will know what ruin a bush fire may cause." Gladys said nothing. When Clnro had gone she sat down on tho edge of tho bed und stared round her� at tlio little veranda room with its primitive shutters, its walls papered- with pictures from the Xllmtlrakdimi Graphic, its home-made furniture and sunken earthen floor covered with rugs und matting, its rough wnshstand and dressing tablo on which Gladys's Bilver-hauked brushes and atray of toilet implements looked so' incongruous, tho canvas ceiling and tho velvety patch of mos quitoes in one corner waiting for darkness to leavo their shelter. Gladys shuddered. "It wouldn't matter a bit if it weren't for him," sho murmured.. " Oh, my poor Clare, my poor dear, dear Clare 1 Oh, what made you do it? And you love nnother man ! Oh, iB uo one happy, no one in the wholo world? Must one always love the wrong man?" Whon Clare came hack, which was not for a long time, Mrs. Hilditah wus dressed, hor beautiful hair rippling over her low foreheuil and coiled behind with a irediieval looking bnud of amethysts sot iu antique silver, bind ing her head, nnd a like belt girdling her loose muslin and Valenciennes" lace- robe. There was not niuoli sign of widowhood abont her, and she seemed to think it neces sary to apologise for the faat. "Ho has been deud fourteen months, dear, mid I couldn't ever wear u cap. Oh, Olare," she added, coming closo to her friend, and laying a hand on Clare's arm, while she mixed ut hor with earnest eyes : "it is sotei.vde � so hideous to bo glad. Bnt I tried to do my duty ut the lost, when he got ill. Thoysoid he couldu't have lived nearly so long if it hadn't boon for mo." " I know thut. A man told me you were very good to him." Gladys withdrew hor arm, and went back to the glass and adjusted a loose lock of lior hair bofore she answered. Clare had been wondering how she should broach the news of Blanoliard's presence on the Loura. She now saw tliut it was no news to Gladys, and that chunuo luid nothing to do with thoir present proximity to each other. "I know who tliut was," Gladys answered with studiod quietness. '" There is only ono man on the Leuru who could know anything about ino and my husband. It was Ambrose Bluiiohnrd," " I did not know his name was Ambrose," said Olaro. "Yes, it was Mr. Bliuiohard who recognised your photograph and told ino he had known you. He said that he hud admired yon for your goodness to your hus band." "Iam glad," said Gladys, "that at, any rate ho did me thut justine. Come, Clare. I liko this little roam immensely, dour ; it puts me iu mind of iuy cabin on board tho Nana Suhib, only that it is a great deal larger and more comfortable. But I think tho veranda would bo a eooler pluoe to sit or-" CHAPTER XVIII. Clibe's Vow. Tregaskiss, whon he found out who his un- soen auditress had beon� Gladys informed him of tho foot with perfcot frankness, ucooptinp his ill-temper us a matter of oourse, mid asking him various sympathetic ques tions as to tho working of the station and the probablo results of tho fire� did his best to remove tho impression his rough languugo might huvo made. "A follow is hound to swear at these niggera and bullook drivers, Mrs. Hilditch," he remarked confidentially ; " und I'm delightod to see that you're not horrified at our bneh ways. It took mo a long timo to break Cluro in," ho lnughcd his fatuous laugh ; " but now I'vo got her iu excellent order, though sho is still a little inclined to givo herself airs� doesn't take the cheerful viow of things that you soom to do" � Gladys had been giving a sprightly account of her ex periences among the bullook drivers at Cedar Hill and' lior night's camping out " I must say I udmire a woman of spirit. Rum old stick Cyrus Chance, isn't he ? You must have playoa up to him in a remarkable way to get him to bring you uloug, or he may have done it out of affection to my wife. He's very fond of Olaro� makes hor presonte occasionally." And Tregaskiie told the etoty of the six battles of porter, and Gladys began to under stand Gyrus Chance's objeotion to breaking broad ill his house. She began to understand too, dare's far away smile. "That's the explanation of Iter Sphinx look," sho said to herself. " Oh, my poor dear, dear Clare 1 Could he ever have been liumjsonio and frnnk and attractive as Cassandra described him. Forhups in those days he hadn't token to drinking whisky, and grown red und coarse ; und perhaps he was too much in awe of Cluro, when sho was Miss Gnrdyne and went to London parties, to swear before her." Gladys hud already gauged tho situation, and Tregaekiss'H character us well. She knew that a womuu who had five' thousand a year, as long ii b she did not marry again, must command his respect. Ho would, as far aa liis natural tendencies and tho superior do mination of whiBky permitted, ahstniu from rough and ready language in her presence. Then hor beauty and air of fashion awed him. Tregaskiss admired her immensely, though, as he confided to Shand and Goneste later, she was not altogether his style, put him too much in mind of ragged paintors and tho floppy artisHo "'li "8askiss always talked of London lifo as though he woro intimately acquainted with all its social intrioaeioB. He had his manner oplsterous good . humour this evening, rapidly aasumed for Gladys's henofit. and 

 chaffed Goneste about Holon Cusack, detailing tho rumour'he had heard m Uganda of hor -engagement to young Gillespie, and bantered his wife an hor Into need of his professional services. "She doesn't look� does she, Mrs. Hil- ditoh, us if there had been any reason to have a dootor standing over hor night and day for more than u week? I told Clare when I came home that I hadn't seen her laokuig be woll and young and handsome since she flret arrived on tho Loura." " I think she is very hundsome, certainly, Mr. TrogasldBs," replied Gladys with bold- noes, " bnt if y ou think she is looking well, I don't agree with you. I should say she wuntd a lot of nursing and taking care of." Goncsto could not help giving herugratoful glance. Ho had been a little afraid of the ooming of Gladys Hilditoh. Now ho felt sare of her sympathy. She was a many sided person, this young woman. In Europoun society she was all that there is of tho luxurious modern. Here on tlio Loura sho showed a reaction in favour of burburi.nu, and declared that there was' nothing she enjoyed so much as unadulterated nature, and that she was thoroughly tired of London banalities. Sho was intensely in terested in bush lifo; wanted to know all about tho strike � sho had come in at Cedar Hill for a demonstration against the freo labourers, as tho imported shearers from the south were callod � inquired as to tho largo sliocp owners of tho district, and withont onoo mentioning Ambrose Blancliard's name con trived to got a' good deal of information uhont tho Cusacks and their household nnd depen dents. The lively cfanttor of Gladys Hilditch covered the omharrassmont which was now inseparable from any intorconreo between Mrs. Tregaskiss and Genesis when it took plucc under the oyo of others. What an ignorant provincial sort of woman sho was aftor nil, Cluro refleoted bitterly ; how untrainod in the ways of the world. Gladys, sho thought, would have found in the situation only the piquancy of dramatic contrast. Every tone und gesture of this attractive ludy seemed tu indioute u perfect capacity l'ur dealing with a shoal of contraband admirers. Blanoliard's tono had suggested that her methods of distraction liudtuot boon altogether us admirablo as East end visiting. Dinner was over; tlioy were all on tho vorandu, und Tregaskiss was showing off Niug's accomplishments, and mailing her go through her lust " ghirihal," which is blsclc for a song and dance representing tho sound aud notion of sorao animal. Ning's "ghiri hal" was of tho wild musk duck; her little arms flapped, and sho puffed out her cheeks in imitation of the duck's ery. Ya uiiiyu miring Pnsnbu ngi got Mingo nhiknrai Whoog! "Did you ever seo suoh a picaninny, Mrs. Hilditch ?"- ho cried iu boisterous dolight. Gladys was euclnmted. Hero was true local colour; licro was nature unadulterated. At last sho found herself free from tho asphyxiat ing iufluonco of modern civilisation. She, too, must leant a " ghiribal." Treguskiss made the child repeat her performance. He was at his best when playing with Ning, and Gladys begun to feol a less dislike to her host to be continued.
