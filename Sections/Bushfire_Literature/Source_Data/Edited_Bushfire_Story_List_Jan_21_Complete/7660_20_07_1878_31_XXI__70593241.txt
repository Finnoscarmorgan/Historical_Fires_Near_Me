CHAPTER XXI. 

 The bush, fire had beeb, fought and conquered. It ; ��ly: remained for Dick and another man to go 

 ;oack on the following day to see that the frontier ;/.'-was safe ;.that no smouldering logs were ready to' ' j light up the land again, as soon as the breeze 

 should' have, fanned them sufficiently. The naaiu bodyof the flame had gone, up the range, where no . .harm could be done; where, Dick said, as ' Boori as the first rain came, the grass would 

 he all up again, and make nice sweet nicking for - the stock in winter. 

 Wilfred found afterwards that the Benmohr tr: people had not been quite so fortunate : the wind 

 ( setting in that direction, the flames had come roar? ;1 mg up to the very homestead, burning a quantity r ' of .Valuable pasture and nearly consuming the : whole establishment. As it was, the garden gate 

 : caught fire and was partly burned. The farm and ,,, station buildings were only preserved by the des- 

 perate efforts of the whole force of tho place, led pn by, Argyll and Hamilton, who worked like the leaders of a forlorn-hope. After .the fight was over and the place saved, Charles Hamilton was utterly 

 exb^UBtedjWith^ and intense ex* citement. �.He. ,droppedr down "in a faint,andrwas carried in; and laid.on his hedi, to, the . great con- sternation bf Mrs. Teviot, who thought' he was 

 dead. ' 

 - Wilfred and his brother, not having heard of the Benmohr disaster, were inclined to think that a bush fire was rather an over-rated incident, and that with reasonable foresight and energy : the worst consequences were always to be avoided. They liked the wildly romantic task of fighting the elemental foe, at midnight, on the mountain side. ; When they returned to The Chase and saw, as yet, the uninjured grass-fields waving in yellow luxuriance, they felt deeply grateful to old Dick for his well-timed strategy in burning round the 

 buildings. 

 "-If those, gentlemen at Benmohr had done this, when we did," said the old man, " they'd not have had such a narrow squeak for their stacks and buildings. They're nice young fellers as ever I see, and they ain't noways afraid of work ; but they don't know everything; and it's my belief that this season will put the stuns on more than them, afore it's over." 

 Now that the passing excitement of the fires was over, matters settled down into much the same grooves as before. The grass was dry but highly nutritive, as is the habit of Australian grajses� inured to almost incredible periods of^deflcient rainfall. The stock, having abundanceu^ofigood water, took no harm. Indeed, theyj-had-never looked better, having " hardened" ,:npon the ripened haylike grasses until they were at the very apex of bovine excellence. 

 The roads became, it is true, very dusty. The smaller water-courses ceased to run, and the pure element was confined to the deeper basins whict are to be found in every Australian stream Nature's reservoirs, they, in "the day of need." 

 I The inhabitants of Warbrook had come out suc- 

 cessfully from the fiery; trial. But Wilfred was destined to a sterner* personal experience of the ordeal. It so chanced that he had been staying for a few days with Mr. Forbes, helping with a mus- ter for fat cattle, which that gentleman was con- ducting. Suddenly the weather exhibited an un- precedented and wondrous change. It was on a Thursday morning, a day destined to be for eyer memorable in the annals of the colony, that the two friends were enjoying themselves after the fatigues of the muster. Breakfast was overhand they had settled themselves in their respective arm-; chairs for a good comfortable read, when Forbes drew his companion's attention to the extraordi- nary appearance of the day.. 

 " It is fortunate," said he, " that we have not to go out on the run, for a more terrible day, as far as appearances go, I cannot remember. Remark what a dull, darkening, yet lurid appearanee the sky presents ? The thermometer has reached a hundred in the ihade of the verandah. A true and unmistakable hot wind is setting in from the north, in short, angry puffs like a furnace-blast. I wish now,that I had burned round the place, like you have. If a fire starts up we should be hard Bet t�'fight it. The cattle are restless, and seem moving��p the creek. The air seems dark enough for smoke, although there is none rising anywhere. It often clouds the sky from a distance in weather like this. Suppose we take a walk down to the Reedy Swamp, and see if there's anything up in that direction." 

 " All right," said Wilfred, " we can Walk down; it is scarcely a mile." 

 The two young men started off in a. leisurely way, Forbes leaving word with the man who acted in the generally useful department; of the esta- blishment, to; ":keep a good look out." The stock- man and oneVor .two spare hands, including the groom, had gone; a day's journey with the fat cattle, as is the custom oh cattle stations. 

 The establishment's, a model one. Forbes-a bachelor and a very-neat and orderly person piqued himself on the complet�ness of his sheds, stabling, and stackyard. The cottage, though not large, was the best appointed dwellingJiouse in the. district, next, of course, to O'Desmond's and The Chase. In advance of his generation, he was one of the first proprietors who constructed his cattle sheds and stabling in a substantial and expansive manner-walls of masonry having been substituted for the ordinary [slab and weatherboard, as yet considered good enough for all improvements on 

 Crown lands. 

 . " When I do a thing at all, I like .to dp it well," he was wont to say. "It will only need doing once; The'cattle have been paying,so well of late, that I can afford to be a little extravagant." 

 '* The cottage, and out-buildings: stood1 upon a small eminence, below which ran the creek, an un- pretending stream,- now rather low, but boasting a magnificent waterhole,: which the blacks hadnamed Tarrone--a gathering ground for the tribes in old days. Around,- in all directions, stretched the primeval forest. Tal 1 straight-stemmed eucalypti were ranked in endless glades, sufficiently park- like in appearance, but not so "'open"-as the stockmen phrased it-as the environs of the other 

 home-stations.' . - 

 ;M As they went 'along they amused themselves by discussing a remarkable book which had just ap- peared^ and which, having been duly read by most of the members of the club, had elicited diverse opinions.' They had followed the winding path, half road half cattle-tr�ck, which led to the Reedy Swamp, and coming suddenly out from a promon- tory of the forest, debouched upon the great marsh. .A wide far-stretching level, covered with tall reeds above 'the height of a man. It was several milos in length and in places nearly three miles broad. Before them; a dark dense cloud of smoke was raising itself to the murky sky. 

 "The whole marsh is on fire," said Forbes. " Great God 1 what is thatp Look there 1" 

 As he spoke a rushing sound was heard, then a crackling , of the tall dry reed brake. A sheet of flame-a dread unbroken wall of fire-rolled onward-towards them. 

 .For one moment (the two men gazed in speech- less wonder at the portentous phenomenon. Then Forbes shouted hoarsely, "Run! man, run for your life ! We-have not a moment to spare.'" Both turned from the hot breath of the fire-wave, and raced at their topmost speed along the home- ward track. As they reached the house, panting and well nigh exhausted, Wilfred could mark the line of flame just entering the forest, within sight 

 of tho house, desDoiling\\eyery�yard(Qfyearth, as it swept before it; like a hundred-mow�rs, the^tufted graes and herbage of the forest. 

 Their,man had armed himself with ,a stout bag tied on to a pole, which, moistened from time to time, was more efficient as �; besoin of offence than the green boughs, which tiiere might not be time to renew. But all waa in vain. As Forbes gained the door of his cottage and; turn- ing, saw the breast-high flame sweeping'up for- wards the buildings, the fierce, steady, remorseless^ �imo�m breath urging it on, he felt that if all the men within a circuit of fifty.miles h�d been there willing to work for their lives,' the day was lost. Like the Norse Kine, who felt his ship, sweep silently, at midnight, into the deadly resistless eddy of the Maelstrom,,all human might, in such an hour, was but a childish protest against'the dread element�l Force in its hour of triumph- ' 

 He seized the wheel with a giant's grasp, 

 But were he ten thousand men, 

 In vain that moveless wheel might he clasp 

 Earth's myriads were nothing then. 

 So with the Fire-king ..pl the/Waste ; he may be ! guarded against and cheated of his prey by timely stratagem. He may be fought, mastered, and put to shame when winds are low and herbage sparse, if he be buffeted ere he rears his crest amid the broad savannahs or the tangled forest. But in th� ^frue day of his pride and might, when the simoom blast . comes sweeping, red-stormy, with the 'heated'air, from the trackless plains and burning sandhills of the inmost desert ; then, if the herbage be abundant and he rule unchecked for a little space, all the men and horses in broad Australia are powerless to stay his path, or gainsay his tyrant will. 

 James Forbes, gazing , on the advancing flame and mentally computing the surroundings, saw that his homestead was doomed. As to trying to fight hack with a bough the flames, now advancing on three sides, no man living could have stood near enough to the line of fire to go through the mock- ery of trying to stem it. Such was its force and fierceness, hurried on by the ill-omened blast, that the fire did not confine itself to the dead dry grass, but catching the bark hanging loose from their butts, leaped from tree to tree in advance of the steady glowing flame-line, dropping blazing leaf torches amid the yet unignited grass. 

 " Blest if I ever see anything like that in all my days," said the henchman. "It's all up, sir, I'm afraid ; and I'm jiggered if we shan't run a good chance of being frizzled, if we don't look out. It's the Last Day !" 

 As Wilfred looked forth upon the murky heavens, far as eye could reach, one mass of dim, dense, vaporous cloud rack, broken by lurid splashes of flame, and wearing over all the dark deep, pall of an infinity of thunder clouds, he felt minded to endorse the last speaker's opinion. Well might he, or any other man, be reminded in his heart of the Qrreat Judgment, so dread and un- speakably awful were the apearances of that yet unforgotten day of wrath. For five hundred miles in length, and with a breadth of more than half the distance, the whole land was aflame on that one and self-same day I From th� coast to the table land, from th� plains to the Great Alpine Chain, every station, farm, hut, or cottage, was being con- sumed with greater or less completeness. Three 

 hundred miles due east of where Forbes was left harmless that day, a shepherd's wife and children, watching with terror the wave of fire closing on them through the woods, fled to the poor shelter of the little shrub-covered creek* It was a mere hol- low in the brushwood. The remorseless billows ef 

 the sea of flame came hustling over the bank and swept raging and devouring through the dense forest. When the husband and father returned 

 that evening, with his terrified flock, picking their way timourously over the heated earth, he called in vain around his poor hearth for cheerful wife and prattling babes. . He ended a frenzied search where six corses lay in the rivulet bed, clasped in each others arms, the babe on his mo- ther's breast, all charred and disfigured almost be- yond, even his powers of recognition. 

 On that day farms by the score were swept of every fence and stack and cottage and barn, leav- ing the stout yeomen to commence life entirely anew. Stations were despoiled of buildings, fences, pasture ; and in some .instances,, .when the terrified sheep stupefied by the smoke and blinded by the fire refused to move, the flocks were burned by thousands as they stood. The plough horses were burned in the Stahles, where the distracted owners had not hurried to free them- at the;first alarm. " Travellers" afoot and far from aid,, sur-, prised in the depths of dangled scrub or trackless forest, perished in th� universal conflagration. 

 And far out at sea, it was recorded that showers of. ashes fell on the decks of vessels, whil�' the whole outline of the shore was marked by-a funereal pall of smoke, dense as when from the long silent Vesu- vius arose the fire torrent which, in a few hours, buried deep beneath ;the lava' wave the pleasant cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. ; . � 

 Bitter were the thoughts of James Forbes, .as he stood and watched the fast coming foe, so soon to whelm in- red remorseless ruin the pleasant home which had been to him so satisfactory an outcome of long days of toil and patient, self-denial; 'There, in the old days had he lived,"for the first year; in a bark hut, on the gre�n knoll: above'the reed bordered pool from which the station had taken its name. -Poor Tarrone I How soon would it : be a heap of ashes ! From long experience he knew that hope was gone. He boldly fronted the emer- gency, and strove with a choking feeling in his .throat to-make light of it. . ' , 

 " Lead the horses from the stable, Jack," he said to the man, " and bring them into the garden. > It will be our only place of refuge, as far as I can see� Tell your wife tb come over, too. In half an hour there will not be a stick standing on Tarrone. 

 " Effingham,'' he said, "I feel sorry for having brought you into this mess. But it is ' fortune de gu�re.' It can't Bwallow up the run, nor the herd ; and when the'rain comes, if it ever does come again, the burnt feed will be out-and-out fattening pasr ture. That's all we can hope for now." 

 " Can't we save anything ?" ;said Wilfred. " It seems a dreadful thing to have all the household goods destroyed before our eyes." 

 " We may take a few of the lighter moveables into the middle of the garden, here," said Forbes, " that's about all we can do. Ten minutes will see a breach in our fortress, and after that nothing 

 but sack and .apo� wiU ; ensue.,- There, gem �he

 fiTne; first;>B��^t^as Jm�de:ori the ^�l^jatie^j barn. The 'crawling flamed seemed in a moment to ascend every portion of it at once. They swarmed up, the lofty doors j, searched around for crevices where' the'wheat straws struggled out. A tree near it was in one moment a sheet of flames,,and the burning twigs and bark dropped down upon the dry shingles.: Buta few s�conds. and the red glare, from the mass of sheaves oaten and wheaten, inside, burst but in the roof in half a dozen places; and the whole building was one roaring, swaying 

 mass of flame. - 

 Almost simultaneously the stackyard, the stacks, the eornshed,-the stabling, became'ignited ; a fiercer blast coming eddying up,. the1 whol� place seemed one doubly-heated fiery furnace'.';0' ; . The heat was by thia time intense beyond de- scription. It seemed - to Wilfred as though humanity could scarce endure th� slightest ' in- crease of temperature. "The forest1 was on fife not only around them,,'but overhead,� where the'green -tree tops appeared^ to flare- and blaze like dead brushwood. The domestic fowls dropped arid died by scores. The* wild birds- fell from the tree, tops and expired before their eyes. From time to time, bands of kangaroo came flying aimlessly from their covert, some with fur singed or blazing.-The dasyuri (the native bat of the colonists) ' crept helplessly and' stupefied from their, holes in;the logs. : The squirels^ahd opossums crawled;' and cried lin the burning, branches. A score bf; cattle crashed bellowing through the wood and huddled shoulder deep dn the safe depths of ]the" great water-hole. It seemed to Wilfred as if all'Nature were in the throes,of dissolution. He cpmmericed to wonder, not'without'a thrill .of sudden dread, whether he and his companions would escape with their lives from the generar wreck. 

 Foot by foot had the fire advanced and encircled them until they stood in the centre of the garden, beside a small pile of valuables, including Forbes's writing-desk and his mother's portrait. This last possession had been the first article he had carried out from the cottage. Roof and rafter of this .edi- fice were now blazing, and so fierce was the heat that none could approach near enough to break in the back door with a pole, after tho first few mi- nutes of its ignition. .; 

 The old woman had, with commendable fore thought, brought over a large , can of coldwater. With this, as they stoad with hands and faces'blis tered, their clothes scorched in places, and their skin desiccated as if spontaneous combustion must supervene, they moistened, their lips from time] to 

 time, ' ."' . ...*.'.'. .' 

 As they were hoping that the worst was .over, and that the fire must goon abate for want of fuel, a half-dried bed of peas, dangerously close', took fire and burnt so fiercely that.it nearly drove :thein from their stronghold. " ' ' ,'? ; l ; 

 At length, after hours of endurance, their season of purgatory was ended. P,orbes Btrode forward and, [keeping down the smouldering gar'den fence, walked out of ] theenclosure andproclaimed'tie siege at an enc� V � jl;, ' ,'' ","1t.*. '

 The members of the* ramily at The" Ch�'s�-were naturally alarmed and inconceivably astbhisjied at tbe suddenness and completeness pf, th� disaster in Mr.] Forbes's case. 1 The land pf .'their adoption went down many degrees in their "estimation.'

 '"'After all," he said, " the grass %illtgrow,again.

 When the papers came in, the accounts tpf; �pss and ruin over the length and; breadth of st�e/l�nd were appalling: ,-, : , < j-,.-,vl 

 " Never since,the \\ early history^ of the-colony," said the leading journal, ";had:any .climaticjOccur rence involving such wide:spread calamity/fbeen recorded. The poor aad the rich had suffered, in thia case, equally. These conflagrations,pf the natural grasses, analogous to the great forest and prairie fires of America, had, ofMcourse, been known since the earliest settlement of the colony. They had been observed as promoted by the aboriginals, for the destruction of certain descriptions" of game and for other purposes connected with their rude means of livelihood. In seasons of unusual plenty it had been customary for the shepherds and stockmen of the interior to set fire to the long dry pasture, for the purpose of inducing a growth of sweeter, herb- age. Such imprudence had hitherto been regarded as venial , if not allowable, in the partially occupied state of the land. Ho great harm had been seen to result from them, though the fires had occasionally spread beyond the original commenc�m�nt. But now it was clearly the duty of the Government, in view of this disastrous and unparalleled conflagra- tion which had inflicted an amount of injury, as widely spread as ever memorable,- to take measures for preventing, by the statute law of the land, any unauthorised tampering in future with an elemental force, proved to be so dangerously 

 uncontrollable." 

 "I quit� agree,with the principle laid down in the Monitor," said Mr, Effingham, "It i� mon 

 Btrous, that in weather like this, any irresponsible person should be suffered to kindle a fire which may lay waste a district. I would make it highlj penal that any one should, set fire to the grase during certain months on his own or another's land unless sufficient precaution be taken, as in om case here the other day, to keep it under." 

 "You are right," said Forbes; "there is no doubt whatever that this great fire by which we have all suffered must have been originally sei alight, in different parts of the country, deliberately and intentionally. No doubt, with tho grass in its present state, and with the scorching weather we have lately had, many of the fires might have been burning for a week. That, of course, makes the folly or carelessness which originated them the more criminal. For there is always a chance of such an abnormal day as this ' Black Thursday,' as the men call it, occurring, wfien, with everything in its favour, the fires are sure to ravage unchecked." 

 "I wonder how the other fellows 

 got off, at JBenmohr. They had nothing much to burn since their �>reviou8 touch up on the week be ore," said Wilfred. 

 " Oh ! I heard from Dick," said Guy, "that Mr. Churbett had a narrow escape, but got off with part of the horse paddock fence burnt. Captain Snowdon got a good fright, and said it was the day of judgment. Peter, the stockman, said ' Jeave us the key of your box, sir.' He's a saucy fellow, Master 

 Peter. 

 " * Hold your tongue, you blas- phemous rascal,' says the Captain ; and Peter grumbled out that the fire made some people mighty re- ligious. However, Peter climbed on the kitchen roof, and put a wet tarpaulin on it, or else, they say, it would have caught fire. Mrs. Snowdon was as cool as a cucum- ber, and canned up a lot of water herself. A black boy to-day said some big one gentleman was very bad after the fire, but I couldn't make out who it was." 

 " If it hadn't been for old Dick," said Rosamond, "we might have had to carry water too. How glad I was afterwards to see what a protector the burned ground was to us. He's a regular hawk-eye. We must go over and call on Mrs. Snowdon, and see how she is after her trouble. However, she is in her natural element in danger, for I never saw any woman so utterly 

 fearless." 

 " There is a legend that she de- fended the place against bush- rangers once, said Forbes, " when Snowdon was away. She fired a shot or two at them. But I be- lieve they had the grace to clear out when they found the master of the house, who was far from popu- lar, was absent." 

 That night a black boy came racing up to the entrance gate, and sent in word that he wished to see Massa Wilfred. He recognised the favourite black boy of the Snow don's, a smart, handy youngster, who was game-keeper, ostler, stockman, and errand boy, com- 

 bined. 

 "Well, Bennelong, what's the matter P Your mistress quite well, and the Captain P" 

 "That one Captain dead!" said the messenger, with an air of per- fect coolness, rather at variance with his heaving chest and.dilated eyeballs. 

 " DBAD !" echoed Wilfred. "Cap- tain Snowdon dead I Impossible ! You must be dreaming - What 

 could be die of P" 

 " Him big one walk about long a fire. That one fire murry hot make him liket knock up. Then him drinkum cold water and lie 

 down longa bed. By and by plenty die. No gam- mon. Missy tell me saddle Charcoal, and tell you. Then go on longa Yass, and tell parson Turnwurt." 

 " And are you going there now ?" 

 "My wordl Missy say budgeree pull away. Parson come back longa me to-morrow." 

 With thi J the sable retainer departed at speed, as one upon whom no responsibility was cast in the matter of horseflesh, on account of the urgency of his errand. 

 Wilfred, after considering the matter, thought it unnecessary to give the whole of his melancholy information that night. He contented himself with informing Rosamond that Captain Snowdon was dangerously ill from the effects of the Are, and suggesting that they should drive over in the morning, and see if they could be of any use. 

 (TO BB OONTINTTBD.) 

 On Monday afternoon a meeting of gentlemen washeldat Wangenheim'a Hotel, in Caatlereagh-street, for the purpose of establishing a gymnasium for the physical development of the youth of this oity. There were about thirty gentlemen present, and letters of apology were received from Mr. S. Lazar, Doctors Morgan and Fortescue, Mr. Henriques, Mr. Horace Webb, and li. W. Goerga. Mr. S. Lyons was voted to the chair. It was explained that Professor Vignet and Mr. Layarrague (who hold diplomas from the Behool of gymnastics in Paris) had been endeavouring to found a gymnasium in Sydney Bimilar to those in England, France, Germany, and Switzerland. They had been to Mr. M. Burdekin, who was willing to lease to them a site for the proposed building, at the corner of Crown and William streets, on a lease for seven years at �50 a year. Considerable discussion ensued, when it was resolved that Mr. Burdekin be asked to give a lease for twenty years instead of seven years. Mr. B. Backhouse produced a plan of the proposed building, which he had drawn. The plan showed a pretty structure with a large hall, and surrounded with retiring rooms. It �B proposed to start a company with �1500 in Bharea of �5 eaoh. On the motion of Dr, Schutte the meeting was djournedfor a week.
