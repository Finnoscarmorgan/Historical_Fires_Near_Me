CHAPTER XLIX,-THE VICTORY WON. 

 " In heavenly love abiding 

 '( No change my heart shall fear j 

 \\ And safe is snell confiding 

 ' For nothing changes here ; 

 The storm may roar without me, ,v. : ' , My heart may low be laid, 

 r But God is round about me, 

 And can I be dismayed t" 

 It was full time for Ruby to rouBe herself; for the hour was close at hand when all her energies would be taxed to the utmost. A day or two after her visit to Harley-stroet, the sisters were a little surprised at the sudden appearance of Mr. Riohard Patterson. Morning school was just over, and Joan, Brenda, and Ruby were sitting together, rather tired with several hours' uninterrupted work among the pupils, who woro all just trooping down tho chestnut avenue, under the superinten dence of Mademoiselle and tho junior governess8 Betting forth to tako their oustomary noontide 

 walk. 

 Richard had lately undertaken to supply the Misses Carisbroko's establishment with various comestibles in which he traded, and Mrs. Bray declared that never since Bhe took to housekeeping liad she boen accommodated with such bacon and such fowls, Buch butter and such eggs-to say nothing of tho wonderful sausages-at priceB that were the reverse of exorbitant ! Joan's first idea waB that Mr. Patterson had arrived on business-and so he had, but on far other business than that of which she thought. 

 " I dare Bay you aro surprised tosee me, Cousin Joan and Cousin Brenda, at this busy time of the day," bogan tho gentleman ; " but something happened this morning : that is to say, Lucilia Cook brought me a letter from Laburnum Placo; that I felt you ought to seo without delay, and it seemed easier to como and toll you myself, than to write about it, for I am not much of a scribe, neither is my littlo woman at homo,-indeed Nancy aaid to mo directly she had road tho lotter ' Now the best thing and tho only thing for you tc do, Richard, is to go and take oil' that apron, auc catch tho first omnibus to Hampstead Heath, anc so break the news to yoiu* cousins, for it will bo t Bhock to them, for all that has come and gon< between us all and that poor, misguided fellow." t. And then Richard, paused, for his far fron impromptu preamblo to take effect. Ho and hil Annie had carefully framed tho Bpeoch he was ti make as an introduction to the tidings he had t< 

 impart, and they flattered themselves that it 

 would break the ice most admirably. j 

 As indeed it did. There could be but one in terpretation to Richard's words, and Joan at once 

 answered, " You bring us bad news of Frank ?" I 

 "Well, yes/' replied Richard, trying to look as1 unconcerned as he possibly could. " It seems ho was unwell on the voyage, and when he landed at New York he fell in with a very bad set, who seemed to think of nothing but how to feast and revel and spend their money. He was taken very 

 ill several weeks after his arrival--some kind of fever, evidently, for all his boon companions at' 

 onco deserted him, and he was left to tho tender mercies of an old harpy of a lodging-house woman, who nursed him very much after tho fashion of Sairey Gamp. Fortunately-I ought to say providentially-there appeared upon tre scene, when things were at the worst, a good Christian minister, who had, by tho merest ohanco as it seemed, heard of Fred Carey's deBolato and almost hopeless condition-Fred Carey was tho name Frank assumed, it appears, when he fled the country. This good man took mattorB completoly into his own hand. Frank was delirious, and could do nothing for himself, but ho talkod incessantly about his wife and children, and sometimos entroated an imaginary person to write to his sister Joan to lot hor know ho was dying. Tho Rov. Mr. Ellison sont in both doctor and nurse, and, aa far as tho illness was con cerned, I should say the poor follow had every chanco. But it was too late j ho was too far gone ; hiB intemperate habits had quito under mined his constitution ; and he confessed towards the last that he had spent hiB timo in one con tinous drinking-bout from the day ho set foot on the New York quay till sickness overpowered him. The doctor gave little hope from the beginning ; the nurso, an experienced, Christian woman, gave none ; but both tried hard to pull him through. It was all in vain ; when the disease was con quered, ho sank rapidly. But beforo he diod, hia full senses returned, and he know that he was on tho brink of tho gravo. Ho opened his mind to Mr. Ellison and to Mrs. Barstow. Ha seems to have gone back to the days when he waa a lad at Perrywood % to his career at Oxford ; to tho time of his first coming to livo in London. Ho told them all his shortcomings and his sins-all his follies and his shame. Ho seems not to have 

 spared himself in the narration. All his moan was that ho had wasted every opportunity, that he had sinned against light, and fought against .onviction. Ho confessed to those kind friends 

 his real reasons for leaving England, and told them that, in spite of his apparently destitute condition, ho had three hundred pounds safely lodged in a certain bank, under tho name of Frederio Carey. He directed that this money should be remitted to mo, to whom it lawfully belonged. Last of all ho dictatod a lotter to poor Ada, bidding her adieu, asking her forgiveness, and beseeching her to take Iiis sister Joan's advice concerning tho children, and bring them up to bo the rovorso of what their father had 

 boen t" 

 Joan's eyes woro streaming by this time, and 

 Richard ceased his mournful tale. 

 " Como now, Cousin Joan/' ho began, with a very suspicious moisture on his own lids, " it is of no use to frot 5 and really I don't know that a better thing could have happened. Ho was pen itent, you seo j and all his cry was, ' God bo merciful to me, a sinner/ Ho did not die steeped in his iniquity, as might well have boen. We may hope, I think. Wo don't know what thoso last hours might havo done, what might have passed between his soul and tho merciful Father whom ho had so greatly offended. It seems to me as if nothing short of being brought face to faco with death would over haye causod him to repont -that is genuinely. Ho Avoidd have gone on, perhaps-most probably, indeed-bringing shanie on his family, [and boing an anxiety to all con nected with him/' 

 " We could not possibly grieve as if it were one bf our sisters in Australia," said Brenda. " Frank has never been anything to us but a trouble and an anxiety 5 still, ho was kind to Netta and to me when we were tiresome, naughty children in the old schoolroom at Perrywood. I hope God has forgiven him." 

 " We must leave him in our Father's hands," interrupted Joan, who seemed unable to bear any discussion on the subject. "Wo have a Saviour who is mighty and merciful to save, who has promised to reject none who truly seek Him : that must bo our great hopo and consolation." 

 " And to think poor Ada was a widow, 

 and never know it r' continued Brenda. " I supposo, Cousin Richard, tho letter was addressed 

 to herP" 

 "Yes, it carno by last night's latest post, and Rosamond opened it. Lucilia was at my house thi� morning at 9 o'clock. Now, I should think,!wo might get tho�o two boys into an orphan asylum." 

 Tho Bhock was great to tho sisters, especially to Joan and to Ruby, whom he had petted years ago as much as was in his selfish, self-centred nature. Brenda, characteristically, took it more calmly. Still, no ono could help feeling that it 

 was a relief to know that there was no further 

 causo for dread; and there seemed something like a tangible hope for the future of the children now that no adverse influence could be made to boar upon their career. 

 And so Frank Carisbroko died, and was buried among strangers in tho beautiful cemetery of Mount Auburn, and except to tho few who had the misfortune to bo his near relations, his|momory bas perished from the earth. 

 So surely docs sin bring its own punishment, so truly hard is the way of transgressors ! 

 "When Uncle Ben heard of his death, ho came forward and offered to tako permanent charge of the second boy. His step-children were all grow ing up satisfactorily, and wore pretty well out of hand, and Mrs. Ben was quito willing to do her best for tho orphan, remembering tho days when her own little ones were fatherless and destitute. Thon an nttenrptwns made to place Boggie in an orphan school, and, by dint of unprecedented, 

 efforts on the part of every living Patterson, Cook ' and Carisbroko, tho little boy AVMS duly elected, within a few months of his father's death. 

 And now ensued a period of absorbing- though \\ 

 uneventful labour for tho sisters at Chestnut ' 

 House. The winter quarter brought them a large j �increase of pupils, for their school was becoming celebrated ; their house was now quite full, and several persons wore waiting for expected 

 vacancies at the Christmas recess. One of the 

 governesses proved unsatisfactory, and quite un equal to her work 5 Brenda became confused when her energies were overtaxed, and though Euby put her shoulder to the wheel, and did her very best, a great deal of extra toil and responsibility naturally devolved on Joan, who had been over wrought for a longi whilo past. The end of tho half-year brought with it tho usual repetitions and examinations, involving a great doal cf In creased labour; for though Joan's system was decidedly superior, in those days, she still ad hered to many of tho old plans, which modorn governesses affirm to be far more laborious than satisfactory. 

 Joan herself declared that sho liked the bustle, sho never soomed to tire, her energies never flagged, sho almost frightened Ruby by her care less, unwearying application to duty, and even Brenda mildly remonstrated and told her sho would break down before tho holidays, if she did not spare herself. But Joan only replied that sho did not feel much tired ; sho had got into tho spirit of tho thing, and must go on to tho �nd. It was already the first wook in December, and less than a fortnight would leave thom their house to themselves. Then BIIO would rest, and bo as idle as they could wish 5 she meant to havo a real quiet, lazy vacation, doing nothing that she could help, and going nowhore to visit ! And with this promise, Brenda and Ruby wero obliged to be content. "Only," said Brenda to Mrs. Bray, " she looks so feverish, she seems to be going on as if sho were wound up to a certain pitch, and could not slacken paco till the machinery ran 

 down." 

 And Mrs. Bray shook her head, and replied, " I've begged her to give in before it's too late, but it's of no uso, Miss Joan won't bo said ! Sho's up early and down late, and in every place at once, it seems to me. I shall bo truly thankful when breaking-up day is over, and tho last of the young ladies is fetched away. And then she'll he regularly knocked down, and have to go to bed to koop hor Christmas, as you will see, Miss Brenda ! A racehorse can't keep on for over." 

 But brcaking-up day had not arrived when Mrs. Bray's prophecy began to be accomplished. One morning, just a week before tho holidays, Joan, who had("beon reading "Competition Themes" before breakfast by gaslight, suddonly Btartlod hor class by slipping down amongst them in a dead fainting flt. All was confusion and affright, especially when it was found that the attack did not yield to the ordinary remedies. Dr. Parker was sent for, and, after some examin ation of his patient, looked extremely serious. 

 "I am afraid you aro in for along spell of nurs ing, Miss Brenda," ho �aid. " M�BS Carisbroko is very ill, and will continue so for the present. I think I would advise you to dismiss the school as speedily as possible." 

 " This day week is - our proper breaking up." 

 " Chango tho day to to-morrow, and writo to tho parents immediately. Tho London girls may bo fetched away to-night-some of thom, at 

 least," 

 " Do you fear infection ?" , , 

 "I cannot say at present preoisoly what J fear, but there is a great deal of fovor. :� /This illness has boon impending for woeks ;i it-will bo.wiser on every account to clear tho house of the pupils." 

 Dr. Parker's counsel was takon, and in twenty 

 four hours Chestnut House was left to tho invalid and her nurses ; the pianos were all closed, tho great schoolroom silent, and the servants went about treading softly and speaking undor their 

 breath. In a tl^y or two the doctor was able to 

 decide that tho fover was not infectious, but the patient was about as ill as she could be, and needed the m�st unremitting attention, the tenderest, most careful nursing, if they were to cherish hopes of her recovery. No, it was not that the fever was of so very bad a kind, but that Miss Carisbroke was in no state to combat with disease; she had evidently overworked herself, and gone on long after she ought to have taken rest. There had been certainly an undue tension of mind ; there had been much mental strain and struggle, which, combined with the incessant and increased school work, had terminated in complete prostration of nervous power. 

 "What you say is quite true," said Ruby, mournfully. " As an old friend, I may toll you" that our poor brother, who died tho other day in New York, gavo us a great deal of anxiety before he loft this country. Indeed, tho circumstances of his leaving were most distressing, and Joan, aa the head of the family, was greatly troxiblod. Then she was with Ada when she died : altogether she has had a most trying half-year; she has been worried and grieved, in one way and another, over since she was hastily summoned from Dun ham Tower, whore sho was spending her summer holidays. Brenda and I did not know till tho other day how much trouble poor Frank had caused. She kept the worst part from us." 

 "Yes, and then tried to drown anxious thought and care in unceasing labour. My only wonder is that she kept up so long ; most women would have succumbed days before." 

 " But you think there is no actual danger ?" 

 " I cannot say that, for there is groat reason for apprehension. AH depends, humanly speaking, on tho caro that is takon of hor. Twill do my part, and I doubt not you will do yours. / When tho fever has spent itself, the weakness will be alarm ing. Tnko care pf y�urselvos, and share the watch between you 5 there will be moro than enough for you, and Miss Brenda, and Mrs. Bray to do-I think you had bettor lot mo sond you a first-class 

 nurse." , . 

 To which proposal the sisters at first demurred. But before many days had passod they were glad to avail themselves of it, for Joan did not improve. Dr. Parker wished for " another opinion," as tho illness bogan to develop into rather unlookedrfor aspects, and refused to, yield to the ordinary treat?, ment. w "'*''.?.? 

 Christmas waa a dreary season to tho sisters and their faithful coadjutor, Mrs. Bray j all through the Holy-tide, Joan lay seemingly uncon scious, and between Ufe and death-it was not till the New Year came in that Dr. Parker dared ti bid them rejoico in the first signs of unmistakable amendment. Joan had an excellent constitu tion, and in spite of much suffering and excessive weakness, it triumphed, so that tho third week in January saw her fairly on tho road to conval 

 escence. 

 School duties were resumed a little later than usual, but Joan waa not allowed even to think about tho pupils. Everything now depended, Ds\\ Parker assured hor, on her taking the long and perfect rost she n�eded. It would bo a sort of 

 penny-wise-and-pound-f oolish proceeding to think . of returning to the lightest duty till health and strongfch were perfectly established. And, truth to tell, Joan manifested no desire to keep up tho work which had so suddenly dropped from her hands. She was miserably feoblo and depressed, and she would lie for hours on her eouoh without spoaking-some times dozing, some times letting tho tears, which she could not control, �OUTBO eaeh other down her pallid cheeks, without making the least effort to wipe thom away. 

 Early in February the winter seemed to break up ; ice and snow disappeared, the Bun shono, brightly and warmly, and the first spring flower 9 began to peep out in the borders. And Joan must go away, Br. Parker said ; " tho sooner �he had complete change of scene and air tho eooner would ahe recover strength and return to her accustomed duties." And then arose the ques tion, where at this still chilly season, should Bhe goP 

 While tho sisters were debating between several places on tho southern coast, there came a letter from Mr. Gregory Patterson to hiB cousin Joan. He had heard from Richard Patterson all about her illness, and he wanted her to come and spend a few weeks with him at his houso in Sussex. He waa getting an old man now, ho said, and he should like to see something of his own kindred before he died ; he had been thinking a great doa! of poor Louisa of late, and nothing in tho world would givo him so much pleasure as receiving her daughter under his roof for as long a timo as she could make it convenient to remain. And she had better bring one of her sisters to bear her company, though he was thankful to say his house keeper was ono of the best nurses living ! 

 Joan at once determined to accept Mr. Gregory's -invitation, and take Ruby with her, for she felt unequal just yet to being left alone among strangers. A competent governess was already engaged to fill tho chief place in the schoolroom, and thero was an efficient junior teacher who could very weU undertake Ruby's duties. Brenda must remain to represent the Misse� Carisbroko. ; 

 It was on a mild, spring-like afternoon that Joan and Ruby reached the station where Cousin, 

 Gregory was to meet them ; Lindenfield being a .? good two milos from the railway. He was th�re, with a comfortable close carriago and pair, and two servants who evidontly regarded their master's will as law. From tho deference paid to him by tho railway officials, his cousins argued that ho was a person of consideration in tho neigh 

 bourhood. 

 Joan was fatiguod, but sho had not borno tho journey badly, and the sweet, frosh air of tho Downs and tho lovoly sconery greatly refreshed hor. She gathered, as they drovo along, that Lindenfield was a dot ached residence standing in it3 own grounds, and delightfully situated,'as well as s' olU r ;d from wind aud weather. " For you seo, Cousin Joan," said Mr. Gregory, " I am gotting an old man-tush ! I am old, for I was sevonty-two last birthday, and I thought it would not do at my ago to perch myself up on tho hill tops, as I am apt to be laid up with bronchitis in hard wintors. I thought at first of building, a snug house to suit myself, but seeing the adver tisement of Lindenfield, I carno to look at it, and found it BO nearly like what I had in my mind's eyo, that I went back to town, and set tho lawyers to work to inquire into the title and all that sort of thing. Never buy an estate, Cousin Joan, without making yourself quite sure about tho title ! But here we aro at the lodge-gates. Welcome to Lindenfield, ladies ; may you, soon get back your roses, Cousin Joan, and you, my pretty little maid, may you go back aa bonnie as you are now, and ever so much happior, for your sojourn in the old '- man's j home." , ' ,
