OUR BOYS' STORY. 

 BEDOURIE THE HALF-CASTE. 

 CHAPTER VII.�On the March. 

 By BULLOO. Author of "Gurramou," "The Wisdandra," &c. 

 "My word! this is a baa Job," groaned George. "Fancy being tied up like this all night! Won't they take our words that we won't try to escape?" 

 '"Ear 'ira," grunted the sailor. "No one but a colonial youngster would be so soft as to imagine a stinkin' nigger would take hany one's word." Harry said nothing, 'but bis mind was busy "revolving plans for escape. " There is no chance of Bedourie coming to our rescue for some days! if ever," he thought, " and if we cannot escape by our own efforts we shall be in a bad fix. I bonder what they have done with our rifles." At that moment the lad heard the well known click of metal upon metal, and came to the conclusion that the blacks had brought the firearms, and probably the ammunition, with them. " If we can only get possession of the. rifles we can" make a fight for it," said he to the others. " Just so, but how are we going to do it? said George. " If we keep a sharp lookout we are e-ure to have a chance before long," replied Harry cheerfully. The night passed most -miserably) though George fared better than the others, for he wriggled and twi?ted until the hide which bound him to the tree gave a little, enabling him to lie down. Something seemed to tell Harry that they would come out of their difficulties eventu ally, and buoyed up with the hope he kept a keen eye on their captors. Sampson, on the other hand, being sorely bruised, and of a more determined character, writhed men tally as well as physically, realising their helplessness and probable fate. At the earliest dawn the blacks were ci6tlr, and having divided food between themselves and the whites, whose hands were temporarily released, the journey was resumed. Our friends, especially Sampson, were terribly stiff, and at flm could hardly ex tend their limbs, but after a while moved at a fair pace, Sampson tried every devica for causing delay. Something appeared to be in his boot, and he had to sit down and take it off, then it was the other boot. He also , required frequent drinks, and was often in need of rest. After about half-a-dozen of these manoeuvres the blacks saw through the ruse, and when the sailor halted, pro posing to lie down under a tree, be re ceived a prod from a sharp spear which made him jump and acquire sew life. It was the tall black whom Sampson had kinked bo effectually who used the spear, and he grinned Joyfully as he prepared to repeat the operation. But Canando, who appeared to exercise considerable Influence over his mates, interfered, making refer ence to Gurramon. During the hot, weary march It was dis covered that more than one of their cap tors spoke a little broken English, and Harry determined to ascertain if possible what their plans were. He noticed that a fine-looking young black smiled at them, in rather a friendly fashion, and seising an opportunity afforded (by a savage climbing a tree for a goanna, which attracted, the attention of the others, said : "My name Harry. What name you V "Bogung," was the reply, given in a cordial tone. " Which way you and me go now V " 'Longa Gurramon." " Whaf for lookout Qurramon ?" ?"That fella wantern whitefella." " What for wan tern ?" "Gurramon whitefella, too. Bel that fella go longa Bay. Too many-whitefella loaga Bay." " What does he mean fey that, Sampson?" asked George. " B means that Gurramon's gallid hof goin' near the bay hln case 'c gets na/bbed. Very likely 'c's wanted tor something." "He says that Gurramon is a white man," said Harry. " Just so. I've hoften 'card that before. Some say 'c's a hescaped convick. Hany how, this nigger seems to know hall about 'im, so 'c -must be a white man." " What for Qurramon want us ?" said Harry to "Bogung. " That fella say, ' wantem see whitefella mine vret old fella now, blmeby tumble down.' " " E means Gurramon says 'c's getin' hold and wants to see some 'White men berore 'c dies." " You thlnkit Gurramon kill us, Bogung?" continued Harry. " Bel me know," replied the man in a careless tone, as if life and death were matters of perfect Indifference. "That's not quite so satisfactory." re marked George. 

 "My Word ! no," said tlie sailor. Hit looks "bad." " Not a tit of It," quickly rejoined Harry. "If G-urramon is sentimental enough to want to see whites I>efore he dies, he's nut going to kill them. On the contrary, ho may load us with presents, such as gold or diamond mines." " Well done, Harry," cried George. "My ; word ; you've put new life into me. I feel I as skittish as old Sammy did when the nigger prodded him with the spear lust now." r * "Look 'ere, young fella, don't you be too skittish," grtwled Sampaon. " Tou'4l want hall the ltte you can scrape together before you get fcout hof this. For pure nidioticness give me the colonial youngster who goes prancin' habout an1 krfin' an' makln' a pure goat of 'isself when 'c hougfat 4er look sad an' knocked nup." " Why, -what's the matter with you now?" asked George with an air of injured la in r J� tV Up> hJs !t ? V/hy> don>t y?u "c 7hiJSi V l' /aster- But l Dever ye*- �'w Cr O e lO-?s ano 3 ?e U" gSler **?

I'll tell Bogung to tie your hands again " For a minute it appeared as if Sampson would not give way, but. gauging Harry's character correctly, he nodded assent ranu tering : ' . " Hall right ; but hevery dog 'as 'is day an my turn'll come yet " ? �hISf 'rT? �? r the last few mileB had laI� tnrougn heavily-grassed open country, bear ing more to the -west than formerly, and Sampson bad remarked that they had ap peared to change they course, and he won dered why. � The reason did not remain long unex plained. The grass was very raHk and dry so dry in fact that its seed came off readily, penetrating the white men's clotban and causing great annoyance. When the band had reached the limit of the open country they left a few pieces of lighted bark on a bare piece of ground, with the uplifted ends in the grass, and, returning on their tracks, waited for the expected conflagration. In a fe.w minutes a tiny column of smoke was seen to rise, soon followed by denser bodies, and shortly a bush fire was raging furiously towards them. Expressions of satisfaction escaped the blacks as they turned off their tracks al most at a right angle and headed for a low range of hills. " The heverlastin' skunks !" cried Samp son. " Tba.t'll put hour tracks hout, an* smother hany chanst of Bedourie flndin' b�." " How'b that ?" queried George. " Well, don't yer see the lire '11 cover ow? tracks with burnt grass, bo that Bedourie won't be hable to foller 'em?" "My word ! that looks bad," said Harry, "but after all I don't think It matters much. By the time Bedourie gets Miss Watson away from Boko our traoks will have disappeared anyhow. Besides, he may get killed." "Don't you worry yourself habout Bs6 ourie," rejtfied SampvoH. " 'EH save the girl hlf 'c's halire, an' then 'ell try to pick hup our tracks." By this time the flames had spread to the ea�t and to the west, as well as towards the travellers, so that they had to quicken their pace in order to reach the ridges before they were surrounded. And to rapidly had the Are flown over the ground that the last tew hundred yards had to be traversed at a run. Apparently satisfied that there wav little chance of their being successfully followed, the blacks walked at a much slower pace, breaking up into smaller parties, each of which sought for game. Bogung and four others kept guard over the whites, the most watchful being Samp son's tall friend, Sneepul, whom the boye had najped Snipfc. This black was never more than a yard or two away from the sailor, who muttered vows of vengeance every few minutes. No game was secured by Hogung's party, but towards evening the various seetlona drew together, and when camp was form ed for the night at the head of a small creek, a queer collection of animals waai produced. Moonda proudly threw a kangaroo from ais fcroad shoulders. Another produced a. 

 small turkey, while others provided suake?, kangaroo rats, bandicoots, goannon, and 'possums, the last arrival in camp being a wiry, crafty little fellow, who borj a carpet . enake coiled round his neck. All were in good temper and high spirits, apparent ly quite forgetting the dead they had left behind them. - Fires were quickly lighted, and in a short time the air was filled with a most appetising smell of roast meat. After a short meal had been par'akon of the men formed into groups round three of the Urea, Bogung end the slayer of the � carpet snake being at the same fire as our friends. The carpet-snako man, whom the lads had christened Weasel, was telling some tale* that was eviuently relished by hla companions, for they laughed heartily, which a round-figured savage with heavy features did not seem to approve of. ? " What ,for you laugh all about, Bo gung ?" said Harry. " That fella Wannerin been carc-hom snake, and that fella Bilgandra been lose 'em," was the reply. - " You tell 'am all about, Bogung ?" ask "cd George. "We want to hear 'em." v �" That fella Wauuerln and Hllgandra �� been look out tucker, and they stop, look out goanna bole, and Wannerin see carpet snake tail close up longa foot nelongln' to BUgandra. So Wannerin look up longa tree, and tell 'ew Bilgandra goauna go up other side, and when that fella go sther side tree. Wa&ne-iin kill 'era snake, and when BUgandra see that feUa snake, my ' word him big fella angry. Ha !ha!ha '. my word ! b^dgery fellu Wannerin." A very sow 11 joke �oeb a long way with -the Australian aborigine, so that the un fortune BWgandra, whom of course the lads immediately named Billgander. had to 'submit to good-numoured chaff for many days. The following morniug the blacks hunted as they travelled, and the boys uovtr ceased mai velhug at the accuracy with which the blacks tlirtsw thair nullas and soears. In the middle of the afternoon a large watercourse was reached, and a camp was formed. This appeared so unusual that ' Sampson inquired the cause, to which Bo gung replied : '" To-morrow lookout, Gurramon. You and me takem plenty kangaroo and duck." " They di>n't like to Join a big camp bempy 'anded," explained Sam.yson, "so I suppose they'll do a lot of 'untin' this hafternoon." " How will they get the jjucks ?" asked George. "Blowvd Wf I know, but they can catoh *�m, for I've seen 'em bites; Mg'iar leads fjlnto too bay." The -lads were not left long in -suspense, for IKoouda and Canando brought a long net which had been concealed in. some 'touches, and beckoning the lads and' some of the men to follow, walked away parallel to tbe bank of the river, while some of their mates proceeded in the opposite direction. Presently a part of the creek was reach ed where the banks were much higher, and � the party halt�d. Then Moouda, seizing the rope attached to one end of Jhe net � in his teeth, climbed a spreading gum tree, and, having secured a comfortable posi tion, colled to Canando, who took the rope at the other end, and swam across the waterhole. When Canado had reached th� other sid� he also cllxpbed a tree, so that the net was spread across the chan nel, � being about twenty fe.it above the water. Bogung then motioned the rest to lie under the cover of some bu*?hpj, at the same time uttering a long-drawn eoo-ee. Meanwhile some of the other blacks had walked Borne distance up the - creek, and having^ discovered a large flock of ducks hid on' tb* far side of them - awaiting tn% signal. : When the cooee was heard She blacks arose, and wWh loud yells sent the tevrll'ei birds flying towards the ne'.u. But the ducks were either very tired, or had not been muc\\h ddcturbed, for tney alighted on the waiter a quarter of a mile too soon. But they were not allowed to rest, for the Macks followed them up, and in a few minutes the birds were once mere in the air and rushing at great speed towards the ambushed blacks. As the ducks ap proached Hlarry whAsipered : " What a pijty ! See, they are flying too high, and wiM go over the net." But tlhe blacks were prepared for such an emergency, and as tlhe birds approached the net, boomerangs were thrown b/gh above them, while Mbonda and Canando uttered the cry of tlhe eagle hawk. Instantly tlhe duoks, innagtniing some of their most dreaded enemies were hoveling above them, dl�ped in their course, nnd rushed against the net, whicfa being let go fell into the water, enmeshing a large number of the quacking, s-truggMng bids. The net had bairdly reachfd the water before the blacks, plunging in, seized It, and In a few minutes were dragging their prey to tie bank. The am'buEh. had proved eminently- suc cessful : flPty-itihree birds, nearly all fine black ducks, had fallen vlnt'.nrsvto the In genuity of the savages, who were in hl*fl\\ glee a� they returned to the camp, pJ'iy ing praotloal Jokes uT>on each otiher, ani s-inging corroboree songs. As �<he day drew to a close the va-rlous members of the party dropped In, until all were as sembled, each bringiling ?rae con*.rdbut.'.on to the oolledtLon of spoil. The blacks were evidently pad at being so near the termln�ition of their Journey, and G-urramon's name was continually upon their lips. After the evenllng meal the various pig ments employed in thefr adornment fT corroborees were produced. nml unitil a la'e hour the savages were engaged in paint'ng themselves and each other. Moonda, who was very difficult to pease. bad two or three of the younger men occu pied In making him what he ni doubt considered beautiful, but when the apen tion wa^e completed he would hnve m~d? a splendid cenitrepiece for a nlghtmn'o. His forehead, the exceptin of a cir cular spot of about the size of a two -BhUling piece, was painted white, and a round patoh of the same colour ad"irn?l aadh oheek, a white Imperial also being placed on his chin. In the centre of his broad breast was outlined a large scjuaro, the border of which was about 2in. wide, 

 while the middle was oocupted w'.th an accurately drawn skuill. The ribs from the square to under the arms were each picked out in white, while long stripes of the same colour were drawn from the hlpj to the feet. The piece of ant of which he was proudest was drawn on his stomach, ai>d depicted the rising e<:n. , It was near midnight before Mcondst allowed the young men to return to their own adjriuncnit ; he then .-truLtcd befo.ro tlie boys, and turning hi.s back to them he pointed to the Bast, intending thorn to ffa'.'her fhat that por tion of his body would be embellished In fhe mciniing. The other blacks 'had alsi .decona'.e:> themselves, but (he lads observed that their backs and heads were left un touched. " Why is this thus, Sampson ?" said George. " Well, hi'in not quite sure, but hi think they're led till the mornln' for hit would hall be spoilt before morniir', especially the 'air." "You're right," said Harry. " That* whnt M'oonda meant wlun he turned his back to us Judt now and primed to sun rise. Oh ! my word ! isn't Snipe a guy ? Oh ! you horror !" he exclaimed as the savage approached. Sn.'pe fiad, lifce all his friends, a -white forehead,, but his dbeefes were paluted with a'iternaU patches of white and blue. Hi* <!hln was white, his nose a bright red. white his ribs and limbs were picked o-ut with white, the lotervealng e.iMices tre!ng bnifelbt red and blue alternately. T*e savage was evidently well pleased with the effect he had produced, aad" grinning sar donically, he looked nxelly at Sampson, drawing his flinit knilfe across the small of bis back. In'tiraating by the action that he Intended eo-me day to have the sailor'? kidney fart. By degrees the men so'.tted down round the fires, but Sampson re marked that they had not seen C^nando during the evening, and he supposed he had gone on as courier. (To be continued.)
