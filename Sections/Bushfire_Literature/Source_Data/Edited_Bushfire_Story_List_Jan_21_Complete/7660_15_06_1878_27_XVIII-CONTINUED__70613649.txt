 CHAPTER XVIII.-CONTINUED. 

 If Howard Effingham could only have bent his mind with the same unflagging perse verance to matters of material advantage that he devoted to the establishment of the Lake William Hunt, he would have been an eminently success ful man in any country. Never would he have needed to quit his ancestral home. He would have anticipated all difficulties ; would have re pulsed or compromised with the foe ; dually to triumph, as do all men whose intelligence is per sistently exercised, and whose industry knows no 

 pause. 

 Prona the moment he had taken up this idea of establishing a pack of foxhounds, he was indefati gable in every endeavour to carry out the plan successfully. He wrote to divers persons in this and other colonies who had, either at the present time or in time past, been infected with the same complaint. From them he solicited draft processes. Afc the same time, he commissioned a friend in Surrey to send him out a dozen couples of the famous Beaufort Justice strain, with which he trusted to complete "the pack" already founded 

 with skirters and babblers. 

 In some enterprises everything appears to go con trary from the commencement. Hindrances, break downs, and mortifications pf all kinda arise, as it were, out of the earth. On the other hand, occa sionally, it appears as though "the stars in their courses fought'ybr " Sisera," so ilo.ving and unex ampled are the beneficial incidents. The Hunt �cheme had its detractors, who looked upon it as unnecessary and injurious, if, indeed, it were not also impossible. These amiable reviewers were signally discomfited. The sportsmen commuicated with proved in all cases sympathetic. All sent a couple or two of hounds, much above the average of gift animals; and one gentleman, relinquishing his position of M. P. H. in Tasmania, shipped the larger portion of his pack, firmly re fusing to accept any rate of remuneration. He further stated that he should feel amply compen ; sated by hearing of their successful incorporation t in the Hunt of so well-known a sporting centre as 

 that o� Lake William. 

 A kennel had been erected, ot course ay DICK. . Evans. He had the dash and celerity of a superior 

 ship carpenter in completing edifices of the sort, insuring stability, but avoiding exasperating pre cision, the curse of your average mechanic. His collia^ue, old Tom, who grumbled at most innova tions, was, wonderful to relate, in a state of approval and enthusiasm. 

 It further appeared that everybody in the dis trict had a couple of hunters, which he earnestly desired to get into condition, a task for which there had never before been sufficient inducement. Stalls and boxes were repaired or erected ; and the tourist through the famed district which lay around Lake William, was enabled to report that nowhere in Australia had he seen such an array of well bred, well conditioned horses. 

 Eventually all necessary preparations were com pleted. Ten or twelve couple of hounds had been , got together, had been regularly exercised, and, : thanks to old Tom's efficient services as whip, en 

 couraged to confine themselves to one kangaroo at ? a time, and to follow the scent in early morn with 

 a constancy truly remarkable, considering the cha racters which they mostly enjoyed. So forward were all things, so unvaryingly smooth had the whole machinery worked, that after deep consider ation, and several councils of war, a day was at ; length fixed for the formal establishment of the 

 . "Lake William Hunt Club." 

 1 Notices and invitations were sent oui m ai ? directions. Even here Fortune favoured them. I ; so happened that Hampden and St. Maur, witl ? the Gambiers and a few more "esprits, forts," hai . business (real, not manufactured) which compellei 

 their presence within such distance as permittei attendance. John Hampden was supposed to ridi . to hounds in such fashion that he had few equals 

 Formerly, in Tasmania, a Master of Hounds him Bilf, his favourite hunter, The Caliph, was evei now a household word in the mouths of such lover of horses as bad seen the original celebrity, o: had even listened to accurate descriptions fros ? admiring compatriots. 

 Such a glorious season too ! Why does no - Nature more frequently accommodate us with BUCI 

 easy luxuries-weather wherein every one is pros perons, easy of mind, and, as a natural conse quence. charitably and devoutly disposed ? Every body's stock were looking well. Prices wen high, and indeed rising. There was a report gain ing ground of rich lands having been discovered anc settlements formed in the far south. That fad meant increased demand for stock, and so tendee to make all things more serene, if possible. No body was afraid to leave home-no bush fires were possible at this time of year, the stock wert almost capable of minding themselves, and if c mau had an overseer who didn't drink, why, hf might go to England without imprudence. Suet was the wondrous concurrence of fortuned 

 favours. 

 The great and glorious day arrived. Following the run of luck which had marked the whole en terprise, its beauty would have rejoiced tho hear! of any M. F. H. in the three kingdoms. On such a day, had Fate permitted a well-known covert to be drawn in the shires and a straight "goer" to be thence successfully extracted, any true foxhunter would have confessed that his life had not been spent in vain, inasmuch as his eyes had been per mitted, if but once only, to look upon such an absolute perfection of hunting conditions. 

 As "the party commenced to assemble on the preen knoll, which lay in front of the garden fence in view of the lake, it became apparent that all connoisseurs united in the verdict that there could not have been invented a better scenting day, or a pleasanter one. There had been rain on the previous one, and during the night anxiety had been felt lest a merciless downpour might mar the full enjoy ment of the unprecedented pastime. Beside which the ladies would have been prevented from gracing the affair, or have been rendered comparatively inef fective by clinging habit-skirts and drenched head 

 gear. Too kind, however, were the elements. The hazy dawn had gradually yielded to a sunrise, toned by masses of slowly moving soft grey clouds. The air, saturated with moisture, became clear and almost spring-like, as the morning advanced. The wind changed to a few points neaTer weat and gradually lullod to a breezy uncomplaining mono tone. The thick green glistening sward, though reasonably damp, was firm and kindly in the in 

 terests of the contending coursers. It was a day ' of days, a day of promise, of fullest justification of existence. In such a day hope returned to each heart, strong and triumphant ; care was a lulled and languid demon, and sorrow an untranslated 

 symbol. 

 Nearly all the ladies -who were to assist at tho grand ceremonial had ridden or driven over the night before. "Warbrook was therefore nearly as fully occupied as Rockley House had been at the Taees. It was many a day since the old walls bad included so largo and mirthful a party, had list ened to such joyous babble, had echoed to like peals of innocent ringing laughter. 

 Of course, the fair Christabel and her mother were early invited guests. They had brought a girl-cousin. Mrs. Snowdon had also asked leave to bring a friend staying with her at the time. Miss Pane had. of course, been entreated by Mrs. Effingham to be Bure to como, but that young lady had written, sorrowfully, to decline, " inasmuch as Doctor Pane was absent on business." A small postscript, partially reassuring, stated that he was expected home the next day, and that if the writer could possibly manage, she might ride part of the way to Warbrook, and join some friends who were to come to the breakfast. But this was a hazardous supposition, too good to come off, �fcc. Deep regret was expressed at The Chase on the receipt .of this note ; but the world went on nevertheless", as it does in default of all of us. 

 Can I essay to describe the array of dames and demoiselles, knights, squires and retainers, yeo men, men-at-arms, and others of low degree, who, on that ever memorable autumn morn trampled the green meadow in front of old "Warbrook House. Atany a day has passed Bince the shadows of the waving forest trees flecked the green sward, sine� the hill side resounded to horse-hoof and j ingling bridle, while mirthful words and silvery laughter blended ever and anon with the unaccus tomed bay of the foxhound. 

 Ah, me! Of the manly forms and bold eager brows of those that kept tryst that day, how many have gone down before the onset of battle, the poisoned arrow of pestilence, the thousand haps of a colonist's life. The stark limbs aro bowed, the bold eyes dimmed, the strong hearts tamed, by tho slow, cruel sorcery of Time ere now-even of those, o'er whoni.the forest tree mourns not, pr the wild wave dashes no requiem. 

 How many of that fair company have ridden away for ever into the sad silent land of the Past I What bright eyes have forgotten to Bhine I How many a joyous tone is heard no more. 

 Tho halte her bright smi!o lighted np of yore. 

 Are lonely now I 

 Gone to Hades no doubt are many brave souls of heroes ; but in the good year of grace eighteen hundred and thirty-six, the chances of life's battle sat but lightly on the gallant troop.who reined up at the first meet at Warbook Chase. Many a goodly muster of the magnates of the land had been held in that homo of many memories ere this. But never within the ken of the oldest chronicler had anything occurred so successfully, numer ously attended, of such great and general interest to the district and neighbourhood. 

 Resolved that all the concomitants and accesso ries should be as thoroughly British as could in any way be managed, Howard Effingham had per sonally superintended the details of a hunt break fast, such as erst-while he had often enjoyed or dispensed within the bounds of Merrie England. 

 A mighty marbled round of beef, carefully tended by Andrew through many stages of pickii and sal tpetre, graced the sideboard. On the groan ing table were cold viands of every dijscriptioi and in fullest profusion, as if a Royalist squire compelled to entertain a troop of Ironsides, ho< determined . to show the croo-eared rogues how i gentleman and a cavalier treated even his enemiei under his own roof-tree. Beor-mighty and time honoured beverage of the Anglo-Saxon-had per haps been the greatest difficulty. With the readj practical aid of Jeanie, even this apparently in surmountable obstacle was surmounted. Tho 

 roughly conversant with the process by which th< refreshing home-brewed, and even the "mightj October," which requires caution in consumption is matured, she had. modestly stated that, if some malt could be found in Yass, with the aid of � mash-tub and one or two adjuncts composed bj the ever ready Dick, she could, even in Australia turn out a reasonable draught ale.. The necessariet being forthcoming, through Mr. Rockley's aid, the important manufacture commenced, and after s due sojourn in tho cool cellars of The Chase, the barrels that were broached on the Great First Dav with the Lake William hounds was declared to be the beet colonial ale ever tasted south of the line, 

 North and south, and oast and n*est 

 Tho " visitors" came forth, 

 as though determined to give the Squire of War brook-a name by which Howard Effingham was commencing to be known in the neighbourhood-a substantial acknowlegment of the interest taken I by the country side in his highly commendable enterprise. The younger stockmen from the neighbouring stations, the small farmers, most of the native-born Australians, who had only heard and read of such princely sports, came from all 

 sides. 

 The squatters, then, as now, the aristocracy of the land, mustered gallantly in support of the hereditary pastime of their order. A list might be attempted, were it only like the names of the ships in Homer's Iliad, some day to be read to curious listening ears by the tongue of one un known of aught, save that such, in the dear past, 

 were the names of heroes. 

 For they loare heroes. Men who In that early day of a nation's struggling, oft retarded growth, did strike " right manful under shield," in long enduring wars with the savage, denizen of the waste, combating even danger and hardship, or with the elemental forces or Nature not less dan gerous. Many of these men had left their pleasant Somes in other lauds, or tho older settlements of 

 the colony, to face the dangers of* the desert-the long, wearing, sickening, solitude of the unblessed wasto-where years passed without hearing a kindly tone or touching the fair hand of a deli cately nurtured woman. 

 Of tho prizes which they won, often by the gift of their heart's best blood, their life's best years, some few were enabled to carry "off the fame and t�e treasure, to enjoy in leisured honour. With the greater number it was far otherwise. The rich lands they had found and named had been shared by others. Capital, wary and of cautious footstep, had, while following in their tracks, made nought of their labours. The civilisation which they heralded had, like the unwisely evoked demon of the exorcist, arisen but to destroy them. Such has been the guerdon of the " conquistador" and pioneer through all time. In one age, tho dungeon or the scaffold ; in these latter days, neglect, failure, or injustice. 

 Bat no tho eight of the irony of fate fell darksome] on the merry party which issued from The Chase to greet the �enmohr and Badahos contingents, as they simultaneously rode up from opposite direc tions. With old Harry O'Desmond rode a tall man in a green hunting frock, whoso length of limb and easy seat shewed off the points of an inestimable grey, of grand sizo and power, whom all men saw at once to be Tho Caliph, well known on both sides of the Straits. It was in truth John llampden's famous hunter, a very Bayard among horses, at whom no horse-loving juvenile could look without tears in his eyes. 

 By his side was a merry wondering boy, who sat his pony with the instinctive ease only possi ble to those who have known tho saddle from ear liest childhood. Since that day he has ridden at the head of a troop of Austrian cavalry, and seen the cruel gaps made in'his regiment by the French artillery, at the time Bazaine yielded up Sedan and the honour of his nation. Little thought Johnny that day of the hell-storm of battle those clear boyish eyt s wore yet to Raze upon, all unwavering. As little dreamed we of the Prussian lancer, amid the orangeries of fair Versailles, of Communists at tho TuiierieB, or "p�troleuses"at the Palais Royal! 

 Of that party were also the two Gambiers, Alick and Jack, as also their friend, "Willie Macneil. A brace of cheerful bard-riding young squatters, both having made names for themselves as leading dare-devils, where anything dangerous was to bo done with the aid of horseflesh. Their Romeo five year-olds, with matchless shoulders but somewhat imperfect tempers, carried them admirably. Will Macneil was a, tall, mild, gentlemanlike, musical personage, by no means so " hard" aa his more robust friends. Ile had contented himself with a beautiful little blood maro, whoso paces and tem per apparently suited him. His long legs rested in the stirrups, therefore, at no great distance from the ground. It is probable that he would be avail able as a chaperon for the feminine division, as he did not intend to do more than canter a mile or two after the throw off. He restricted himself, in a general way, to this species of equitation, and as he was amiable, amusing, and by no means badly 

 off. he was very Generally appreciated. 

 Came from "the Broad river-flats and forest parks of . Murray, the principals of the firm of Carey and Podger-the former tall, jovial, hos pitable; the latter short, neat, prudent rather than 

 popular. 

 Cam� from the volcanic cones and scoria-eovered plateaux of Willaree, the. broad frame andjeonino visage of Herman Cottrell. * He was well'carried by his square-built ambling cob, while, beside him, oh a delicate dark bay five-year-old, with the blood of Tramp in his veins, sat the well-known figure of :" Dolly" G�ldkind, a man who in his day had shared the costliest pleasures of the "haute vol�e" of European capitals. Commercial vicissitudes had forced him to importune Fortune afresh in the un wonted guise of an Australian settler. She had, in this instance, not disdained to favour the brave," and Dolly was now in a fair way to see the pavement of Faubourg St. Germain once yet again and to bask amid the transient splendours of the Tuileries. He faced gallantly his Bhar� of un congenial solitude, unadorned Nature, and rude surroundings, tempered only by provincial enter tainments, always awaiting with the philosophy born bf English steadfastness, German immobility, Parisian " insouciance," and it may be a codo of financial philosophy derived from yet another mingling of an ancient race, tho good time 

 coming. 

 Game .bernara wnarton, wita cneejt uronzei with the �erce unshadowed." suns of that dreac waste where rarely clouds linger or the blessec rains of heaven are known to fall. His last who whoop had been heard in his own country-in th< ancestral land. His blue eye was bright and hil smile ready, as though he had never known augbi but lightsome toil and the rarely intermittec sports of his Northamptonshire forefathers. 

 Ardmillan and Forbes, Neil Barrington, and al] the Benmohr "mob," astheywero somewhat dis respectfully called, were iu the vanguard. Neil Barrington possessed one valuable attribute oE tit� horseman, inasmuch as he was ready, like Bol Clarke, to ride anything and at anything. No man had ever seen Neil decline a mount or a fence, however unpromising. But his skill was inferior to his zeal, usually provoking comment fiom the 

 bystanders. 

 On one of these occasions, when he had hit atop rail very hard, in an amateur steeplechase, an ex postulatory friend said, " Why don't you lift youi 

 horse. Neil?" 

 " Lift be d-d !" replied the justly indignan! Neil, " I've quite enough to do to stick on." 

 However, being extremely muscular, active, and fearless, Neil's star had hitherto favoured him, sc that he was cenerally well up at the finish. 

 Pastoral life presents an assortment of duties sc .varied, to be performed at periods so uncertain, that they may without difficulty he arranged tc suit a strong personal need. Of such, possibly was the journey which Mr. Bob Clarke found it absolutely necessary to undertake to Badahos, Ben mohr, and the Sheoaks, with a view to teoing whether any oE the WM store cattle, which had last year been placed on his station, had strayed 

 thither. 

 One needs a staunch horse for "cutting out' work, but the great raking Besborough, which he brought with him, was surely too good to be knocked about any of the Benmohr bogs and vol 

 conic trap "rises," while his conditionsavouredmora: o� the loose box than the grass paddock, �Still Bob was one of those fortunate individuals that everyone everywhere, male and female, gentle and simple, is always glad to pet and welcome. So there was no dissentient to the view of duty he had adopted but Mr. Rockley. And when that gentleman grumbled out his opinion that Master Bob would have been much better at home mind ing his work if he over intended to make any money, he extended the right hand of fellowship to him, and was as gracious as all the world and distinctly the world's wife, and probably daughter, 

 were wont to be. 

 �h,-re were those who thought that Christabel Rockley's eyes glowed with a deeper light after Bob's coming was announced. But such an occa sion would have brightened the girl's flower-face even if Bob had been doomed to eat his heart the 

 while in solitude and disappointment, on the far Mondarlo plain. 

 All tho favouring fairies must have emigrated and combined to chase away the evil powers which essay to mar the chief joys of humanity. 

 " None of the ladies who belonged to 4 our set.' and could ride a little, were absent," Neil Barring ton remarked, " except Miss Fane ; and it was a beastly shame she was prevented from coming most likely by that old Turk of a father of hers. It was a real pleasure to see her ride, and nowthey 

 were all done out of it." 

 Just as Neil had concluded his lamentation for Vera Fane, who had won hisheart by comfortinghim after one of tho many tumbles, and saying that she never saw anyvne who iode so straight without turning out a'firat-class horseman in the tnd, the Granville part}', who had a long distance to come, made their appearance through tho trees of the north gully, and there, on the well-known bonny brown Emigrant, between Jack Granville and his sister Katie, was Veronica Fane, or the evil one in 

 her sweet guise. 

 So tho grateful Neil was appeased, and straight way modified his language with respect to Dr. Pane's parental shortcomings ; while Wilfred Effingham, who never denied his interest in the young lady- chiefly, ho avowed, as a study of character-felt more re-assured and exhilarated than he could account for. The Granvilles were congratulated, first of all upon their own appear ance, and assured that they were not at all late (Rockley had been audiby devoting them arid all other laggards and imbeciles to the infernal deities for the last half hour) -then upon their thoughtful conduct in bringing Miss Pane. 

 "Deal of trouble, of course," quoth Jack Gran ville. "Miss Pane is one of that sort, ain't she? She rode over with a small black boy fir escort, and'nursed us up about midnight. Nearly shot her. didn't I, Katie?" 

 " I am afraid I frightened you," said Miss Pane, with an apologetic expression, "but papa had only just come horrie from Sydney. 1 knew; if I missed this eventful day I should never have such another chance till I was grey. So I lifted up Wonga by his hair, poor child, to wake him, and then started off for a night ride." 

 There was no time for further amenities, as Howard Effingham, triumphant and distinguished in the eyes of the Australian-born portion of the hunt, gorgeous in buckskins, delicately coloured tops, and a well-worn pink, moved off with four teen couple of creditable foxhounds. A very fair, even-looking lot they were admitted to be. There had been just time to give them a little "cub hunting," in the way of wallaby, before the grand and crowning exhibition. Old Tom had proved an invaluable whip, displaying a .keenness, in".the vocation which abundantly verified the tales with which he had regaled his acquaintances as to feats and frolics with the Blazers in the historic County Galway, in the kingdom of long ago.
