I had seen it often enough, and I ought to know. So ought the three o'clock beer, in dirty bigholaws, swinging himself over the railing, or executing a demoniaual jig upon the doorstep; so ought theba butcher, although batchra au a general thiag aee scornful of such trifles; aso ought the postman, to whom knockers of the oost extravagout descriptioo wese meresly human weaknesses, that were to be pitied and used. And a ought, for the matter of that etc, ete, etc. But then it was wIck a knocker. A wild, extravagant, and utterly incompre hensible knocker. A knocker so myaterl ous and suspicious that Policeman X 37, first coraing upon it, felt Inclined to take it instantly iLnto custody, but eompromised with his professional inrstinects by sharply and sternly notuing it with an eye that ad. Initted of no nonsense, brit ounfidestly expected to detect its secret yet.-An ugly knocker; a knocker with a hard, humnan face, that was a type of the harden human face withio. A human face that held between its teeth a brazen rod.

Such a night as this. It was a wild and pittiless wind. A wind that had cornmnenccod life as a gentle country aeophyr, but wandoering through nunufacteuring towns had becomue de anoralised, iand reaching the city had plulnged into extravagant dinalpatiorn and wild excesses. A roistering wind that ln dulged in Blacchanalian shouts on the street eorners, that knocked if tihe hiata fromi the headsl of helpcless passengers, atnd then fulfilled its duties by speeding away, like alt young prodigals,--to sor. lie sat nalon,, in a gloomy library listen. ing to the wind that roared in thle chin, noy.
