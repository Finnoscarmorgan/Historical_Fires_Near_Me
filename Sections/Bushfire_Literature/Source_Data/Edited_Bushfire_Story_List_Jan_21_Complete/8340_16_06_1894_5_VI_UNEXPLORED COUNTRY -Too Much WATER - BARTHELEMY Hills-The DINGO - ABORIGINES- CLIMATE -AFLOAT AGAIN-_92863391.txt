 Having left Anson Bay behind us and sailed a little beyond Cape Ford the coast looks like that at Wallaroo, with a short sloping beach, then grass fiats, and behind them small bushy timber. After this is passed we approach C;-pe Doiabey ; the 

 coast here is generally sandy soil with occasionally cliiis. There were fires on shore. All day we sailed and on through the night, with light winds most of the time between eve and daylight. On the 16th the Barthelenry Kills were sighted. Calms and li-^ht winds prevailed for most of the day till about 4.30 p.m. We steered for what looked like an opening in the bi-:ht between C.-ipe Dombey and Cape Hay. On approaching we found this appearance of an opening, which we hoped would prove to be a river, was oc casioned by a break in the line of bushes that grew along the coast. This spot is lefv- blank in the Admiralty charts and was of course unexplored. There are red cliffs to the south-south-east. The Bar thele.'iiy Kiils bear north-east by east ; high i.-uid is in the distance north-east and east half north. About dark we anchored in li fathoms at the sandy beach. Close to us on our right was a large man grove creek. Just before dark we saw largo flights of cockatoos and during the night we heard birds and the howl of the dingo on shore. The mosquitoes were troublesome for the first few hours, but they died or became torpid as the cold increased. At sunrise on the 17tli we landed, walking through soft mud. and afterwards got the boai on to hard sand. There were numerous tracks of natives and dingoes on the beach. At breakfast a dingo made its appearance, and we thought of shooting it till one of the party suggested than it belonged to the natives. It made cautious approaches, now and then lying down and watching us. It took no notice of the report of firearms. That the animal v/as a ' tame wild dog' was evident from its proceed ings and the fact tliat'iu ...i-.i a cord round its neck. At last the poor brute sniffed food mid then, made rapid advances, till we threw it some meat. After tasting this the dingo ate out of a plate and then from our hand:;, and finally showed its gratitude and the delicacy of its habits by cleaning all our dishes aud cook ing utensils, and. remained at our fire all day. This dingo was of the orthodox sandy color, the ordinary size, and in no way distinguishable from the indigenous dog, or rather wolf, of the southern portions of the continent. Iu the early days of South Australia the tamo dingo was quite a familiar ob ject at the camps of the aborigines, or following the blacks about the town or country settlements. At about 8 a.m. Mr. McMinn, White, Davis, and I started for the south point of the range, south of the Barthelemys. We steered east and at starting crossed and rounded a number of salt creeks, about which were numerous tracks of natives. We saw liithing weirs across the creeks with small openings, and near them mat tings or nets, with which, the natives, it may be presumed, closed the openings as they wished. After getting clear of the creeks and mangroves we came to a hard plain with grass and rushes ; the grass wiry but better than we had seen on the coast before. Bush fires had swept over much of the plain. Before us was the range trending from south to north or north-west ; the Barthelemy Hills to the north of the end of the range, and other hills beyond in the same direction. There was a beautiful south-east breese ; the day waa mild aud altogether like a May day in South Australia proper. We walked on briskly, elated with the ideti of soon being on high hills and having a view of good country. About two miles from the sea we came to a fresh swamp and walking through it soon reached another and then found the swamps continuous. We walked two miles through water and then turned northward to some distant timber, hoping to find there dry land that would lead to the Barthelemy Hills, whence we hoped we could-travel along the range and return by a different route When we reached the first clump of timber we found it a mere island in the midst of the swamp. One of the parry dropped into a hole up to his shoulders in mud and water, and was rapidly disappearing when he was pulled out. After this we found the water invariably deeper when, we came to timber, which was principally paperbark. We waded through rushes and reeds or small bamboos till our party began- to separate. We then wont for a considerable distance through tall flags several feet over our heads, till the water reached to our waists and deepened so rapidly that in a few steps we should have been rednced to the necessity of swimming, so wo reluctantly turned, seeing water in every direction. Logs were floating about and leeches abounded. 1 have no doubt that we were on the edge of a lake and that the water we walked through contracted as the dry season advanced. During our walk we had a view of at least a hundred square miles of swamp. By degrees our party reunited. All had been severely bitten by a kind of wasp, and our clothes were torn and hung about us in shreds. On our return we shot a number of small plover and a swamp bird of a species quite new to all of us, nearly as large as a turkey. There was a large kind of pigeon here, but it was very shy. Roaming in search of game we saw many camping grounds of natives, and on the beach tracks that had been made during the day. I wished, to try and reach Barthelemy Hills by a different route on the morrow, but the party would not agree to this, so this was really our last stopping-place within South Australian territory. We were disappointed at not having seen any natives, as we might have obtained useful information from them, and however objectionable the aboriginal may be in some respects there is always somethingin teresting about the unsophisticated savage, uncorxupted by the evil communications and uninjured by the evil deeds of the 

 pale-faced scoundrel. People in Ade laide had read much in official dispatches calculated to give strong impressions of the numbers and daring of the natives about Adam Bay and the Adelaide River, nr.d in the Territory for a time there was much military drill and setting of guards in order to protect the settlement against overwhelming onslaught or crafty sur prise. Older hands smiled out loud when they read about these things, but for a change they were told that great danger was to be feared from the Malay fleets tltat visited the coast. The crews of these fleets were about as formidable as the natives, or less so, and it has since been found that a South Australian Customs ofiicial of the Northern Territory can keep the whole Malayan navy in those waters amenable to British authority. We had not the privilege of meeting any of the sea lions from Malacca, and for some reason or other the aborigines, while swarming around us, never showed themselves. Those of us who did not belong to the first Adam Bay expedition had not seen a Northern Territory black except once or twice with a telescope. As far as this account of the voyage has proceeded the reader will not have observed much to make him think of a tropical climate, but the fact is we sailed from Adam Bay in the best season of the year. May scenas a lovely month every where. Iu England, the southern portions of Australia, and in the NorthernTerritory it is mild and balmy, of course with the exception of those days when it is other wise. On the sea we were at times really cold, but the atmosphere on land was perfection. For months afterwards the climate in that region is agreeable, until in September it is warming up again, and the moist, sultry, tropical weather fol lows. We had the trade -winds in our favor too for the passage westwards, and when these winds are studied good run ning may b� made without the aid of bteam.

 voyage. We should have accomplished a wonderful trip had we made no stop pages, except sucli as were necessary, to take in wood and water ; but we wished to see something of the country before returning to Adelaide. At (J p.m. we got the Forlorn Hope afloat and set sail, the dingo seeing us off, and looking very melancholy as he sat upon the beach watching our pre parations for departure and then the fast, vanishing boat with its crew. We had treated him. well, and perhaps the simple-minded savages thought the better of us for proceeding on the principle of love me love my dog. The sea on this coast is very phosphorescent � at Cape Dombey peculiarly so. As the wave spread aloug the shore it appeared like a sheet of blue flame. Each man standing in the water was surrounded by a halo of light, arid when the boat moved she left; in her wake a pathway of pals {ire, shoot ing out myriads of blue sjmrks. The wind was gentle till midnight, when it freshened up from the south-east.
