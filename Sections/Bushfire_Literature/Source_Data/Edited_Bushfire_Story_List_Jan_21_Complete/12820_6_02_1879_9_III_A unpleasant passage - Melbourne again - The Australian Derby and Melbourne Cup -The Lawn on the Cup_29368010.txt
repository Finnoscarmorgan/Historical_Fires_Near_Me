 and Family�The Zig Zag Railway�A curious reminiscence �Seals�Moreton Bay. On the 4th of November it was blowing a gale when I left the wharf at Launceston in the steamer Tamar to return to Melbourne. We expected, should it continue, to anchor for the night inside the Tamar Heads; but having the English mails on board we were obliged to proceed for fear of missing the P. and O. steamer. The wind was dead ahead, and blew with terrific violence. There was a very high sea, and the captain told me that he had never crossed in such weather before. The crowd of passengers made things very uncomfortable, as almost every one was ill, and the wailing of the women and children was fearful. The passage usually occupies twenty-six hours, but this took us forty-four to accom- plish, as we were compelled to lie-to half the second night. The 6th was the first day of the Melbourne races�the Aus- tralian Derby Day ; and the great race, like many English Derbys, was run between the showers. It was a very good race, however, and was won by the Silvia Colt, beating Richmond and Maid of All Work, the two favorites. Next day I took a book to the Botanic Gardens, and remained there all day. These gardens are possessed of much natural beauty, and as a place of resort I prefer them to those of Adelaide, but for floral display and artistic arrangement the latter, which are usually a blaze of beauty, are, I think, vastly superior. The Mel- bourne Cup Day is the great Australian sensation. The ladies look forward to it as eagerly as do the men. The lawn exhibited a marvellous display of elegant costumes, and the sight was brilliant in the extreme. One dress is said to have cost �700. The weather was very unpleasant. In the morning there was a strong wind laden with dust; at noon there were showers, and in the evening came heavy rain. The races were very good, and the Cup was won by Wollomai, an outsider. In the train to the course on the day the race for the Oaks was run, I was set upon by four sharpers, who vainly endeavored to induce me to join in the " three card trick.' On the course their game was a short one. Half an hour after their arrival I saw the detectives in hot pursuit of the principal performer, who was soon captured and led off to durance vile. The display on the lawn was again dazzling. The races were good and the day was fine. There was yet another day's racing, but as the s.s. You Yangs was leaving for Sydney I thought it better to go by her than wait for the next boat, which would certainly be crowded. There were but few passengers, and with all sail set to a fine breeze we were soon out of Hobson's Bay. We passed Cape Shank at 9 p.m. There was a fine wind all night, and at 4 a.m. on the 13th we were abreast of Wilson's Promontory, having run 82 miles in seven hours. All day the breeze continued with a cloudless sky. Many whales were seen playing about amid silver fountains of spray. About 11 p.m. we were off Cape Howe. On Sunday at 8 am. we were off the Dromedary. The morning was dull, but as the day advanced the wind freshened. About noon we passed Cook's Pigeonhouse, a high peak 100 miles from Sydney, between which and Cape St. George large shoals of mullet were seen. On the 16th I was awakened by the cap- tain at 1 a.m. We were then entering Port Jackson, so named by Captain Cook after Mr. Jackson, afterwards Sir George Jackson, who was then Secretary to the Admiralty and Captain Cook's greatest friend, having first taken notice of him when Cook was a stable boy at Mr. Jackson's sister's at Cleve- land. It is no wonder that Captain Cook passed this splendid harbor, as in five minutes after entering the Heads the sea is completely excluded. The brilliant moon beams made night a silver noon; still I wished it had been day, as the first impression is everything, and I had heard so much of the beauty of this harbor. The change from a tossing sea to a lake as smooth as glass was very sudden. All around was hushed in silence�-all nature slept. As we approached Sydney, which is seven miles from the entrance, the whistle was blown to announce our advent to the watchman. At 3 o'clock our ship was in her berth, and so were all hands but myself. I preferred a yarn with the watch- man; About 7 I took a cab to an hotel, where I experienced the delights of a cold shower-bath and a hot breakfast. I had often been in Sydney before, but never till now had come by sea. I prefer it to any other city of Australia. It is altogether different. It has lost the new appearance so visible in Melbourne and Adelaide. The buildings look more sub- stantial; the trees have arrived at greater maturity, and the people appear as if they took things easily and enjoyed life. After being up all night I did not feel inclined for much, so went with a shipmate to the Gardens. Here visitors are permitted to roam about at will, and are not confined to the paths. The day was very hot, and on the lawns beneath the large shady trees, amongst which are some splendid specimens of the Norfolk Island pine, many ladies were sitting reading or at work, whilst tribes of children gambolled about. Many rare birds from the bush are domes- ticated, and breed loose in the gardens. The situation of these gardens is very beautiful. They enclose a small bay, and the sea wall and adjacent rocks are covered with oysters, so that the lover of the bivalve can here gluttonise if so minded. On the 16th I was introduced to the Chevalier Blondin, who with his wife and family was stopping at the same hotel as myself, I had a long chat with Madame, whom I found to be a very pleasant little lady. She told me how, when they were first married, she used to sit nervously at the window of their house watching the people return from her husband's perform- ances. How she dreaded to learn from their serious looks that an accident had befallen him, and how she at last gained sufficient courage not only to witness the performances, but to submit to be taken by him across the rope on his back. She told me also that the children often cried to be taken across in the wheel barrow. She seemed very proud of her husband. I went next day on the Bathurst Railway as far as the Zig- zag, in the Blue Mountains. This line is a triumph of railway engineer- ing, and well worth a visit. The day was delightful. It was near this spot that many years ago I met with a strange adventure, which might have ended tragically. I was on my way back to the station from Sydney, and, as was my custom on those journeys, in- tended camping one night in the mountains. I had dined at Penrith, and shortly after leaving it commenced raining. On reaching the first camping ground there was every indication of a wet night, but that troubled me little; I had frequently on similar occa- sions slept soundly, wrapped in my water- proof, beside a good fire. I dismounted, hobbled my horse, secured my saddle, &c, from the wet, end went in search of some dry bark. This l soon found, when to my intense disgust I discovered that my matches were damp; not one would ignite. There was no alternative now but to push on. My nag would not object I knew; he was homeward bound, and did not care to stop in this inhospitable spot. He was a 

 first-rate walker, and at that pace I could keep myself perfectly dry. In about two hours we reached the next camping-place. It was unoccupied. There was no chance of getting a fire, so on we went. I was now extremely sleepy and was constantly dozing, only to be awakened again with a start by the wet leaves on some low branch striking me in the face. After another eight or nine miles a bright light appeared ahead. My horse saw it as soon as I did, and quickened his pace. On reaching it we found that it proceeded from a large hollow log, the interior of which was on fire, and burned fiercely in consequence of the draught through it. Not far away was a bullock-dray entirely covered by a tar- paulin, and with a trench cut round it. The driver had made himself comfortable and I envied him. I dismounted, hobbled my horse, and quietly placing my saddle on the dray pole under cover went to the fire. The ground round the log was much cut up, and the rain had made it all puddle. There was no chance of lying down, and the out- side of the log was too hot and steaming to rest on, so I was compelled to stand in front of it. I soon became so sleepy that I was convinced I should either fall into the fire or into the mud, so knowing the extreme hospitality of all bushmen I thought I might get shelter under the dray. I walked round to the back, and quietly lifting the tarpaulin was much disappointed by seeing two heads instead of one as I had expected. Thinks I, there's no room tor me. As my my eyes became accustomed to the dark- ness I saw there was space between them. Their heavy breathing told me they were in deep sleep, and I thought it would be a pity to awaken them; so quietly slipping off my boots and coat, and rolling up the latter for a pillow I cautiously took posses- sion. I was asleep instantly, and might have slept [on till noon had not the man on my left disturbed me. He awoke at day light, and lifting the tarpaulin to see what sort of a morning it was, turned round, and was only then aware of my presence. His intensely fierce look and still fiercer de- mand to know who I was and how I came there, roused me at once. I told him that I arrived about midnight, and as it was so wet I had sought shelter under his dray, and, said I, seeing you two chaps fast asleep I did not like to wake you. " Chaps be hanged," shouted he; "d'ye call my old woman a chap ?" " Woman!" said I, my hair almost standing on end. Had the dray been on fire I could not have been more agile in jumping out into the mud in my stockinged feet. I was wet in a second, and in consequence had much trouble in pulling on my boots. The good fellow, however, quickly grasped the situation, and once more raising the tarpaulin from within, and observing my hasty movements, said �"Hold on mate, don't be in a hurry; stop and have a drink of tea before you go." I made no answer. Then, seeing me get my bridle, he con- tinued�" Don't bolt like that; you've slept with us and may as well stop and breakfast with us.'' I went after my horse, which had rambled some distance away, and when I returned for my saddle my new acquain tance was up, breakfast was laid out on a board, the billy was on the fire, and he told me I must wait and have a feed. "T'other chap," said he, "will be out directly." Now I had a slight desire to see "t'other chap," as he called her. She soon appeared, and though we had not been introduced, I was greeted with the shy but pleasant smile of a blushing bride. I learned that they had been married only a few days before in Sydney, and I learned more, too, which was that when he first discovered my presence, had the pole pin of the dray been handy, be would have brained me on" the spot. I made a hasty breakfast, as the " unfeeling monster" chaffed his young wife unmercifully. After I had expressed a hope that during a long and happy life they might never be in- terfered with by a greater scoundrel than myself, we parted the best of friends. I rode away musing, intensely gratified in my mind that it is not the usual practice of bullockdrivers to take the pole pin of their drays to bed with them. I was a passenger for Brisbane on the 20th in the s.s. Governor Blackall, which started at 1 a.m. The rattling of my windows told me plainly enough that I was no longer a favorite of �olus, but I defied him, and was early on board. The Captain informed me that we should meet with a strong head wind, and a lumpy sea when we got outside. He was right. It is not pleasant putting to sea in a pas- senger boat during a gale. But the ele- ments may war, so far as I am concerned; they cannot induce me to waste good vic- tuals; they however gained an easy victory over my few shipmates, and set them dis- charging cargo at once. I in my single person composed the dinner party; no one else was present. In the evening, alone on deck, I sat and watched the tempest. The sea, highly phosphorescent, seemed brilliant with sparks to the horizon. We were opposite Port Stevens when I went on deck on the 21st. The wind and sea had gone down and the sun shone brightly. Shortly after passing Long Island a westerly breeze sprang up and we sped along mer- rily. Our captain was a fine fellow, and kept his ship in rare trim. About 8 o'clock we reached the Seal Rocks. Many mon- sters were basking in the sun; some of them lazily raised themselves as we passed, then dropped again with the utmost indifference These rocks are 110 miles from Sydney, and the lucky inhabitants are protected by the Government. There was a heavy squall as we passed Port Macquarie, and the adjacent hills were hardly discernible through dense smoke from bush fires which were raging. The mouth of the Cleveland River first caught my eye on the 22nd. The weather looked more settled. In the afternoon we were abreast of the river Tweed. The neighboring country is very rugged and mountainous. The oddly-shaped Mount Warning stands out very conspicuously. From the valleys the finest cedar is obtained. We reached Morton Island too late to attempt the inner passage, so we had to go fifty miles round. The entrance to the Brisbane River is quite uninteresting, through low, flat, swampy country, covered with mangroves, and frequently inundated. The channel has to be continually dredged some miles into the bay. Brisbane is prettily situated twenty-five miles from the coast.
