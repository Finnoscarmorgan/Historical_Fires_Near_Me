 CHAPTER HI. 

 It was a few days after the events previously narrated. It wanted only a few days to Christinas. Refreshing thunderstorms had fallen and made the whole country look beautiful. 

 Here and "lovely^ pateli of: darkergreen indicated where the bush fire had raged, and the mariner in which these 'portions of thfe runs ; were dotted with fat cattle and horses 

 proved how the "burnt feed" was appreciated by the stock. In the middle of the da/ the h&at was intense, andthe dark low-lying clouds that hanked up towards afternoon from the westward hinted at still' more rain-hic>t : ; ; ;,v 

 : Mr. Leigh and his daughter were enjoying a lounge on the broawl tooi verandah, which was shaded and made pleasing to the eye by a huge grape vine trellised round it, from which dangled some scores of tranches of grapes, all now ready for plucking. - 4 Ah! here's a Go u Ibarra boy, Alice. 

 Wonder what on earth old W illiams ha& sent him sneaking round rafter. Nbtmuch good, I'm sure. Suppose he's thinking I'll be killing some of his beef soon. Anyway, it's drawing near Christmas now, and it's not the time to bear ill-will to anyone ; is it, xay dear ? so let the blackfeliow have 

 as much as ho can eat and drink when he gets off his horse 

 Alice retired to the kitchen to see 

 ^bont a meal for Mickey, for, to tell the truth, Miss Leigh had recognised the Conlbarra blackboy long before her father had noticed hint at all such deceitful creatures are women 

 when it suits their purpose. 

 When Miss Leigh returned to the front veraridah she lound her father pacing up and down, wiping some imaginary perspiration from his face with his handkerchief, and holding an open letter in his hand. 

 4 Urn! Here's a pretty go, Alice. That young fool of a Williams wants to know if I'll be so good as to lend him the use of my yard to run that 

 Coulharra outlaw mare into in case he should not be able to get her across theriver. It ape^fcrs it's a trick of hers to break at the river hank, and she's got away so often now that she looks upon bolting at this point as a 

 matter of course,' 

 Now I think of it, it did strike me as pecnliar that she should leave th< others when we ran the mob of horses across a few week's ago, hut I pot ii| down to the river being a swim; 

 Young Wil I jams �aye that if I tl* n't mad te would- lik� to ride the mare in ���y yard, so that lie could the < trifle her home no Coiilbarra across the 

 fiver, 

 (riving vent to a prolonged whistle the old gentleman coutHtenced again t'j pace verandah-fortunately for Al�c% whose face 1<ad turned pale At 

 the i�st item of news. - 

 * What do you say, Alice ? Ought; I to left the donkev break his neck here at Ashton Vale ? Don't see how I can very we& get out of it. ft would 

 *�e too iaeaa to tehee him the use of 

 the yards, and though the youug f*-i low m*�y be as big a fool a-? his father yet iipjs not a bahy altogether, anil it would look jibit soft for me to say * Yes, you can yard the mare here, only yon musn't ride her.' Oood heavens 1 I'd be the laughing stock of-the district. Oh, well, it's h�� own look-out. I'll let him do what he 

 d- well likes; ,oaly 1 Oppose if any thing happens the lad, Williams will ,have another grievance against Aston 

 Vale. D-him !' 

 Some of the above rather forcible 

 soliloquy was spoken too low for his daughter's ears, but sh^ gathered 

 sufficient from it to know that her 

 lover's life Was soon tobe in jeoparcly. 

 Had she not better adviseher father 

 to refuse Harry permission to bring the mareto the station ? But per haps Harry would ride the outlaw all the same at Coulbarra, and then if anything happened him -she would not be near to soothe him in his pain. Besides, she knew Harry was a good rider, and what, was of more impor 

 tance, was as brave us a lion and as 

 cool as ice when danger was near. Again, when Harryariived with the outlaw, she xiiight have an opportu nity to beg himnot to ride the brute at all. Whilst these and many other 

 similar ; reflectionswere passing' through Alice's mindherfather was inditing a brief note to Mac. Harry Williams saying his yards were at his service at any time. 

 Early next morning Harry, accom panied byMiekey, leading theswif test and smartest stockhorse on Ooui barra, started off to search for the 

 outlaw mare. Tjhe h^^kbpy wasn't long ' in picking .up the .tracks of a mob: of horses awavup under the, ranges onthe Ashton Vale sideof the river. Mow Harry dismounted, and unsaddling let the horse go he jha^ been riding hitiierto. In another Beeped or two the fresh horse was saddled up,Harry tightening up the girths and surcingle in a way that made his favorite stock horse wince again. . . 

 ' Yes, I'll cut the brute out by her self or I'll kill either my horse or her.' 

 * There she is, boss! ' whispered the blackboy, whose wonderful power. of vision had picked the inare out immediately they came in sight of 

 the mob of horses. 1 

 Harry and the blackboy rode along quietly, not w shing to startle the horses at alt if they could help it. Harry had unquestionably got a big job ahead if he meant to cut a single mare out of a mob of mat-s, particu larly if that mare happened to foe a noted warrigal and outlaw. 

 * More better take 'em mob, boss, I tink it,' Mickey ventured to suggest. 

 4 No, hang it, Mickey, we're not newchums. You're not frightened to ride, are you ? ' 

 . * Baal me fright, boss! me ride like 

 de debit !' 

 All right, ickej; follow up as close as you can, and ride as if the devil was trying to catch you.' 

 j The nigger looked round with a scared expression as if the devil-devil in reality was about to pursue him, 

 aEUosiog^Harry to laugh loudly in 

 ; spite of the gravity of the task ahead. 

 Now they are off 1 Harry, at racing speed, shot amongst the flying colts ; and fillies, and pulled them before they had gone a quarter of a mile. The mob of horses split op to the right and to the left, but the yellow :::J^yC>inj^ st<^k-Wh^p playing on her flanks and l^s was 

 sent right ahead clear of the other frightened brutes. OSarry hugged her closely, riding right at her heels. Nevertheless, the outlaw was not going to be taken quite soeasilyas all that. fche propped dead; then wheeled like a whirlwind, and raced for lier life to rejoin her flying mates. But Harry's fresh horse stood him in 

 good stead. Mickey, "who wasn't far ' behind, had tried, unsuccessfully to block the mare, bat his horse wasn't quick enough, and the outlaw flew past right under his horse's nose. 

 Sawy's well trained stock horse ;'?li4d every moveaient as they galloped, and as the marepropped and wheeled, lie stopped dead in a way that would hiv^e sent anyone bnt an expert stock man right over his head to the ground. Then, without waiting for his master's guidinghand, the intelli gent animal wheeled, too. y. Harry ?ifiaBe aii jte :�tiri^ to get racing speed on, and ill less than thirty yards the outlaw was turned again, thistime receiving a heavy cat from her pursuer's stockwhip that drew blood and sent her backing and kick ing in the contrarydirection to that viHpi^ _ Another p*^ya^ acut with the 

 a turn. And so it went on for five of ten minutes. Harry had previonsLy slang out to Mickeyto keep on one side and leave 

 theuiaj'etohnn. ' 

 Harry sat in the saddle as if he had' beea glued there. The outlaw had given up racing, and was trying short rans and Wheels, but Harris good horse and good whip met her at every turn. At last, when both horses were in a lather of foam, the mare decided she had better try another swift gallop, and off she went at 3%htiiii]g speed. 

 Hot this time, as Harry sailed alnng her r ight flank, shekept the direction 

 her master intended. 

 * I'll take, her across the river first, hang me if I don't! just to show her I'm te,' said Harry. * I wonder if she's, had; enough yet or whether she'll break at the river bank.' 

 Harry's speculations were soon set at rest, for die outlaw was not ready to give in yet. Aftera good half hour's gal i op Harry fairly shouldered the od-ilaw down the steep track leading to the wafer's edge. As she stopped for a second and made one more attempt to swerve, Harry rushed his horse right at her and sent her staggering down the bank into the water. She was getting a bit 

 When they had ridden at asmart gallop for a mile or two on the Goul harra side of the river, fianry and Mickey shot her over again straight for Ashton Vale head station, ' 

 ' Mickey, baal you yabba me bin take 'em mare 'cross river,' said Harrys as the station buildings came 

 in vie# 

 The outlaw yarded without any trouble. "She was just beginning to appreciate at a correct estimate the cutting powers of the long greenhide fall at the extremity of Hariy W illiams' stockwhip. But OKee in the yard her teoiper seemed to rise, 

 and she ran round like a wild bullock will sometimes do, with his nose rub bing and smelling the rails. 

 ' She doesn't look a very tempting object to ride, does she Alice r" said Mr. Leigh to hid daughter, as they walked over to the yard to obtain a better view of the mare, and also to speak a few words of welcome to Mr. 

 Williams. . 

 * Harry doesn't come here very often, Alice,"-at which Alice blushed 4nd looked do wn to the ground-4 so we may as well grfre him some sort of a welcome, it's not his fault alto gether, if his father likes Jfco be a boor and a - cross-grained old stick. Per haps the lad may mean well after all. Anyway he's get more plucic than anyone else in this district if he's game to ride that brute yonder.' 

 ' I think, father,* it would be better to advise Mr. Williams not to ride' 

 the thane. She seems so savage.' 

 " Yes, and. she looks as if she could buck herself into a ball almost. If 

 Harry sticks to her he will be a lad t� be proud of.' 

 Alice, in spite of her fear for her lover's safety, experieiiced a throb of joy and pride as. she heard her father's words. Hairy was game enough she knew, but wnefcher he was skilful enough to stack to themare wafi vJiat she was very uncertain 

 about. ' . 

 Whilst Mr. Leigh was conversing with a by no means unfriendly air with Mr, Williams, Alice took the 

 importunity of holding a' brief dia logue with Mickey. - 

 * Don't you be fright, Missee Leigh,' said Mickey, ' my boss rideany tink. .He cobon budgeree feller rider now. Plenty wild .horse lie bin break 'em longa Coulbarra. Dat; mare can't 

 trow 'imtee l ' 

 , Somewhat reassured by the black boy's words, - Alice endeavored to assume a znore lively manner. What was^the good of sending her hero into the lists with the memory of her sad face imprinted on his mind IP .No, she would be worthy of her brave ..sweetheart, and would not unnerve him by even so much as a timorous look on her face. If. her father didn't dissuade bim she would not. ' ' 

 Plucking a rose from the garden as she walked along, she pinned it to her sweetheart's breaston arriving at the house, , where Mr. Leigh leftthem together for a moment qr ^wo, wlulst he retiredtogive some orders to .onifr of themen. . Very soon Harry begged leave to retire, to, the "yards as the afternoon was wearing o�>, andhe %as 

 anxious to see if he coald stick to the famous outlaw. 

 They all three thereupon walked down to the yards again. 

 " * I expect she'll be. hard to catch, Mr. Leigh, like ladies generally are/ said Harry, jokingly, as he lightly sprang over the high yard, whip and bridle in hand, 

 J Mow:; am I to take that, 

 Wil 1 iams-as a compliment, or w^trE' 

 ^ied Alice. ? ] -'A * . 

 '?Oh ! as a , compliment of course, although if I recollect eight, Shakes peare says somewherte, *' LioVe sought is good, but given iinsought is 

 better."' ' .*?; . 

 * Why, Mr. Williams, what would become of the men if women gave their love unsought f Men are surely vain enough already when women are concerned-poor creatures !' 

 * Who are the " poor creatures,'* Miss Leigh, please?' said Harry, assuming an air of simplicity that made both Alice and her father smile. 

 * Well,' muttered Mr. Leigh, in an aside, * he's the coolest lad I' ve seen for many a day. If he's as confident and as easy with the ladies^ as he is with horses, he'll come out a winner right enough.' 

 As Harry advanced towards the mare, she evidently had half a mind to go for the intruder, for she threw her head up, drew her lij�s back like a snarling dog, and sent out short,. angary snorts resembling the puffs 01 a locomotive engine. 

 'Oh, oh!' laughed Harry, 4you have a. nice set of teeth iny dear. Still, it's not reckoned good taste by ladies to make such a glaring display of handsome teeth, though I admit they can't resist the temptation some times. We are all weak and vain aren't we ?' saying which, our hero brought his greenhide whip lightly, though stingingly, down on the savage mare's flanks. 

 4 Ah, ah! Our closer acquaintance is promising to be unpleasant, is itP continued Harry, as his quick eve perceived a scarcely discernible quiver pass over the mare's glossy skin. 

 * -Now, my pet, just imagine me to be a constable, and you a creature whom it is my duty to arrest. Police men, you know, never hurt their prisoners when they go quietly; but if you mean io take it fighting, why, then you'll get it and no mistake, although you are a poor lone female.* 

 The outlaw was not so cowed as to refuse to take it fighting. For a few minutes it was hard to say from the outside of the yard which was man and which was horse,, owing to the dust which was soon . raised. But when it cleared off it was seen that Harry had the outlaw bailed up in a corner of the yard, and was j use on the point of clipping the bridle over her ears. The back of his hand was< bleeding profusely from a wound her ladyship had made with her teeth^ on a previous attempt by him to ir> sert the bit between herjaws. 

 Alice felt faintish, bux placking up courage $he~ rana bandage. Whetf 'siie" rfeturned the mart; was saddled-and -although Harry had been L m doing thiEyet he had fojindic necefcisary to 

 blindfold the mare first. - -. \\J 

 *Now, have a go in at 'a lone hand, and see if you can sli; s ui�* saddle,* 

 as he drew his soft felt hat lie fore her eyes. The outlaw didn't re

 Tier he&dround towards him. ' WleVe

 were not ppoken to audibly, and were certain'y not heaid by Miss Alice 

 * ^Steady, now, steady! Whoa then, mare ! It'll te al! over in a see- od as

 The old man drew ont his handker 

 chief, coughed as ifhe'dgot a fish hope suddenly into his throat, and bb-w his nose vigorously. Alices 

 arm stole round her father'sneck, and she, too, sobbedon his breast.: 

 *1 won't leave she whispered between her little sobs, 

 which were caused by a peculiar mix-' 

 *e of joy " and ?" sorrow; 'but you - 

 withHarry -will yon ?' 

 Then Mr Leigh held out his hand againand graspedUarry's. 

 ' If your father has no objection, I w ou t stand in the way . I am willing to. befriends again any time, and there is no time so suitable as this, when Christmas is so tiearly here.' 

 In a very few minutes Harry and his 'blackboy were galloping away towards Ooulbarra with lighthearts, Harry bestriding the famous outlaw. Whilst Harrydelivered his story to his mother, Mickey delighted the other station hands fey a fall, true,c 

 and taming of the wild mare. Mrs. 

 Williams and her" son tiien made a combined onslaught on the owner of

 Old Williams finally walked off muttering^ ^ It's fooiytygainstone if I reckon Leigh and his /Them iodds ane^ too tnnch, I reckon; so I snppose I'll have to go to the walL Anyway, it's Lteigh, the stack-up old fool, who is the first to show the, white leather.
