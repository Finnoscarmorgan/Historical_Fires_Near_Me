 CHAPTER VL 

 " His step the chamber gains, his eyes behold 

 All that his heart believed not, yet foretold." 

 Cortait. 

 Margaret drew up just out of right of the' house at Bulla, and gave Boba parte! to take 

 "Do not delay a moment, Bob; wo are late." 

 The lad returned shortly. 

 " Please, Miss, the girl said as the Captain had not come back from Paringa." 

 So they drove on, under the gnarled boughs of the old gum trees�the girl s heart aohing with its unwonted load of unrestful thoughts, 

 and with the haunting question that when! �not if�when she had succeeded in per suading Captain Vivian she was utterly indifferent to him; when his presence had passed from the scene of her life, what should she do with the broken strings of the harp! 

 " Love took up the harp of life. 

 And struck on all itsstrings with might." 

 But. ah, me ! if the harp be shattered, and only the wild sigh of regret wanders through it, making weird, riiolian music? 

 . - As they turned in at the large white gates, -and drove-up to the house, Mamaret was precisely in the position of the Corsair, as indicated at the head of the chapter. She dreaded to iind, and yet felt sure that Vivian would accept the iuvitatiqu which Lyndon would as surely offer, to stay and dine with ? 

 them; and now as the huggv drew up before J the house, a tall, grey-clad figure cams from the verandah to help her down. 

 "Good evening," she said, "I hope you had a pleasant ride�did you go to the Refuge ? 

 "Yes, and came home before your brother Wyndham; they went round to some stock yard, but I hoped you would be here earlier and show me the garden." 

 " I am sorry,"inthe coolest of conventional tones; " but I must go in now, and there iB 

 very little garden to see." 

 " And will you come out for a little walk after dinner? do, Margaret; indeed I will not leave you. I will wait patiently till you 

 Melbourne, and then you will give return to Melbourne, and then you will give me an answer ?" 

 Margaret grew white; but like a thorough bred, as she was, she went straight at Her 

 fence. 

 " I am afraid you are making a mistake, Captain Vivian. I like you very much as a friend, as Lyndon's friend, but�please don't call me Margaret." 

 He looked at her face, utterly unable to realise the situation, and leant back against the pillar of the verandah, as if he had received a blow. Margaret moved towards the hall door. Vivian stepped quickly after 

 her. 

 " What do you mean ? you must explain. Why are you so changed to me? have I offended vou. Surely you must know I would not offend you intentionally, look at me for 

 one moment ?" 

 The girl raised her eyes, heavy with trouble 

 and unshed tears. 

 "Don'tyou know that I would willingly die to save you from one hour's uneasiness! and I was so sure you�cared for me a little �was it all a mistake ?" 

 The thought of Lyndon's words�of Lady Jones's account of what had passed at Bangor House, turned the scale. He had made so 

 sure! too sure. 

 " I hope we shall always be friends, Captain Vivian, and " 

 " Oh, who would go parading 

 In London! and masquerading On such a night in June, 

 With that beautiful, soft half moon, And all the innocent blisses On such a night as this is!' 

 Lyndon came round the corner of the verandah singing the stanza aforesaid as Margaret entered the house, and, after a briet colloquy with the faithful Jane, reached her room. Tina was there, busy with an evening dress which she had, as directed, prepared for her young mistress�something black, but with pale blue effects here and there�no marguerites. The little madchen had arranged some myrtle buds at the throat 

 and on the sleeves. 

 "Tina, lam very tired; bring me a glass 

 of wine." 

 She felt utterly unfit to |*o _ through the evening�to play the part of hostcBS, and, like the Spartan boy, 

 " To smile and smile. 

 Though secret wounds cid bleed 

 Beneath his cloak." 

 " Acb liebes Fraiilein ! Sie sind so Weiss," Eaid Tina, as she returned with wine and 

 biscuits. 

 But after ten minutes' rest in a, low cushioned chair by the window, looking out on the prettiest part of the garden, and the mild refresher, pick-me-up stimulant, or what you please to term it, reader mine, Margaret dressed hastily, and was, to a casual observer, herself again. Hearing voices on the verandah�her brother's aua Vivian's�she joined them, feeling the truth of the old saw�" safety in numbers." 

 people? Ditf you see anything of the Taylors?" 

 " We met Mr. Taylor at the Institute; so . many people were there, they were all talking 

 of the ball, or at home, which comes off on Tuesday. Mr. Taylor is coming out to see 

 you. 

 " Capital fellow, Taylor�you will like him, Vivian�he is our S.M., and the finest fellow in these parts. You know Taylor, Wynd ham?" 

 " Yes; very well. I should like to look him up on Monday. Weil, Miss Harleigh. what sort of an affair is this to be�a hybrid 

 arrangement?" 

 And Margaret and Wvndham chatted till the dinner-hell rang, when the boy lawyer offered his arm, and they repaired to the dining-room. 

 The tahle was daintily arranged; the quiet nook which was visited so early that morning had been rifled of its treasures.. The low troughs, "gutters," as Lyndon insisted on styling them, were filled with the delicate fronds of the Adiantum, the lovely fresh green tints and the sparkle of crystal and clear water combined to induce a man of critical taste in such matters to swear by maidenhair fern as the most successful medium for table decoration. 

 "We muBt take you into Hackney on Mon day, Vivian, and show you the lions. We might all go, and lunch at Mac's; what do you say, Meg?" 

 Meg said she would rather stay at home, as they were going out on Tuesday evening, and she bad promised to help Jane in some housekeeping matters. 

 "Well we will leave you to your own devices. We shall have to drive home on Tuesday night." Turning to Vivian�"We generally stay in Hackney on such occasions; but I am afraid to be long away�there is a 

 fire on the ranges too near to he pleasant. T' was out to-day to see if we could not turn a tract of country as a safeguard; but the grass is so long and so dry, ana with the wind as it is at present I am afraid to try." 

 "Mr. Watson spoke to me this morning 

 about that fire. He sent a man out to see 

 exactly where it is," said Vivian. "I suppose, Miss Harleigh, you are well np on the subject of bnshfires. 

 "No; I have only had one experience of the sort," Margaret did her best to preserve a calm demeanour, but it was with great effort die continued�''Have you ever seen one ? You ought to ride out to this fire." 

 " It is possible this fire may come in to us 1" said Lyndon. "I have a man at the Refuge who will ride in if it reaches my country, and then, Wyndham, how will the 'toy lawyer' shape? A few hours in the smoke and that mil spoil any complexion, to say nothing of hands!" 

 "Ah!" said Wyndham gravely, "Idon't 

 mind work; but I must say I dislike grimy 

 occupation. I should beg to enact Hebe, ana carry cooling beverages to the beaters." 

 " The last time we had a fire here," said Margaret, "I had to sacrifice some of Lyndon's beBt sherry. We had no ale or any other drink, so we mixed it with water ana carried it out to the men. Jane declared 

 oatmeal and water was better than anything else; but only few of the beaters agreed with her." 

 "Small blame to them," said Lyndon, but I hope Vulcan or Vesta�which is it?� will let us have a quiet Sunday. Vivian, shall we see you at Gnurch ?" 

 " Yes, Watson offered to drive me in, and has arranged with some fellows to come out to early dinner. He was talking about a Mrs. Macfailauo, who has just left a station near here, and is living in a poor little slab cottage in Hackney. Do you know her?" 

 Lyndon was just then engaged in filling Wyndham's glaSB,and made no reply. Could it nave been fancy, or did bis hand, his mus cular brown kand, tremble? 

 Margaret answered, 

 "Yes, we know her very well. I went to see her to-day. Mr. Macfarlane is gone to Sydney, where his friends are; and she is waiting to hear from him." 

 Lyndon 'observed, in his usual calm tone, and most leisurely manner (it must have been fancy!)� 

 " My dear Vivian, do you know the dif ference between slab and weatherboards? 

 I'll bet a note you don't." 

 Vivian smiled a half-hearted sort of smile, and confessed his ignorance. 

 Don't apologize, my dear fellow, but Mrs. Macfarlane s cottage happens to be weather boards. A new chum can't be expected to grasp those invidious distinctions ! Watson told me .that the people let Mr. Macfarlane go without any attempt at a farewell. He has done so much for this place, gave largely to everything, help to build the church, was one of the first promoters, and most liberal subscribers to the Institute, and if any one had a pet scheme on hand, he always felt sure of five pounds from Macfarlane. All the Hackney, people were made welcome at his station. I can't say I liked the man, but he was generous to a fault, and yet I hear to day ne had to sell his watch, his father's watch it was, to pay his fare to Sydney." 

 The "boy lawyer" ruminated gravely. " They always do it" he said at last. 

 " Do what ?" said Lyndon. I 

 " Rats, you know I they invariably leave a I 

 sinking ship, and as often as not accelerate the destruction by using their sharp, ma licious teeth and tongues." 

 " Yes, you are right. When Higgs, the 

 butcher, left for the Paris Exhibition, having i made his pile, they have him a champagne supper, and a rather more than usually hideous epergne. Do you remember him, 

 Wyndham ? Made his money at butchering, 

 ana bought the run to the east of us, Narra lunga (he calls it Higgs Park !) Awful crea ture his wife. They built a house at St. Kilda, and she declared Bhe found it neces sary to draw the line somewhere, so made it a rule to return the visits of those only who 

 lived in two-storied houses!" 

 " I shall leave you, Lyn. I cannot quite 

 believe that!" ana Margaret withdrew to the drawing-room. She hod just nestled into a deep, coBy causeuse, when Tina approached. 

 " The Mr. Minister Graham and the lady minister have just driven in at the back gates, FraUlein." 

 "Show them in here, Tina," and presently a tall, noble-looking woman entered, with the bearing of a princess, followed by her reve rend husband, whose face at once arrested the attention, so utterly was it an embodi ment of mental power, softened and mel lowed by a frequent smile, full of lovingkiud ness (ponder that word, reader). These were the Presbyterian minister and his wife, who had been at Hackney for many years; the most popular people in the western district, and always welcome as�I seek au Australian simile. 

 " Rain ?" 

 " Ah! yes�the very thing�welcome as rain �at Paringa and everywhere else." 

 After effusive greetings, Margaret offered them dinner. 

 The minister looked slyly at his wife, and with a twinkle of amusement in his eye, replied� 

 "My dear child, if you love us, don't say the word. We have been driving about all day among the farms and stations, and have already partaken of three dinners and two teas! I came in to see your brother about a poor child of McNamee's, in the north paddock. She ought to be sent to the Hospital at Hamilton without delay." 

 " Does not Father Murphy look after her! �the McNamee's are Roman Catholics." 

 " Ob, yes; but his Reverence is away, and, besides, with his warm smile, "what does that matter ? the child is suffering, and ought to be sent at once�early in the morning." 

 Margaret said saucily� 

 "To-morrow? on ye Lord's Day! I thought you Scotch people would let the ox and the ass struggle in tne pit till Monday morning!" 

 "You don't know us yet," said Mrs. Graham; " and what is this we hear about you? are you going to set sail in the Orpheus ? 

 " No, -no, it iB a foolish report, and has vexed me very much�indeed it is not true." 

 As Margaret spoke Captain Vivian and the others entered the room, and, as in duty bound, Bhe made him known to her friends, with a most praiseworthy calmness of demeanour, but with cheeks at least three shades pinker than usual! 

 While Lyndon and Mr. Graham made arrangements for the comfortable transit of the sick child the other friends adjourned to the verandah, where a little table was just prepared for coffee. Mrs. Graham and Wyndham, well known to each other, wan dered into the garden, now glorified by the moonlight. 

 "Doyou imagine we are de trap?" asked Mr. Graham. 

 " I co not know. But what do you think, Mr. Wyndham?" 

 " I think," said Wyndham, whose wonder fnl eyeB usually swept a very large range, " that the component parts of the arrange ment are there, hut that something has gone 

 'agley,' and, as usual, it 'does not run smooth.'" 

 Margaret felt (though she did not look) �like tliat wonderful picture of Goddard's, " At bay"�bereft of her. companions, and the hunter close at hand. 

 " May I give you a cup of coffee ?" 

 1 Thanks," The cup she handed Vivian is worth describing�being one of a set brought out to the Sydney Exhibition�pale 

 . . blue china of tbe finest quality, with a wreath of deep maroon chrysanthemum and white jas semme round tbe brim, hand painted, one of Doulton's _ chcf-d?<zuv">8. Vivian discussed the moonlight, the climate, the bush fire and its probabilities, trying to set Margaret at her ease, and at last succeeded to some ex tent�the lovely soft brown eyes met his frankly, and she leant back in her cone chair as though embarrassment were a thing un dreamt of in her philosophy. 

 The moonlight shone full upon them as 

 they sat there, close to the low trelliswork at | 

 the edge of the verandah. Margaret picked j 

 a spray of jassemine, and compared it with the painting on her coffee cup. 

 Vivian took it from her hand, agreed with her that Doulton's artists "hold the mirrors up to Nature," and, inadvertently (?) forgot to return the spray. . 

 Margaret's fan was covered with the crests and monograms of her numerous friends. Vivian asked to be allowed to look at it, and 

 said� ' 

 "Do you know my motto? It is nil 

 desperanaufn, and I can honestly say I strive i to act up to it. So forgive me if I speak | again to you on a subject�on tbe only subject �which has taken such entire possession of me. I cannot take your words, as afriend,' 

 you said, as meaning that i am not to hope, you may be some day so much more than a friend to me; and surely you cannot refuse to let me speak to you. If you were dismiss ing a footman you would give him some reason, some explanation, before you cut 

 him adrift ?" 

 " The cases are not parallel." 

 "No," said Vivian, and a -momentary gleam of amusement flashed and faded in his eyes�" not quite, but near encugh for pur poses of comparison." 

 "I mean, said iviargaret, "that a man who bad never been in my service could not be dismissed, and so there would be nothing to explain." 

 Her lip trembled, and it was with difficulty she steadied her voice. 

 " But if you wish me to be explicit, I can say that it is not well to make too sure of anything in this world, and that the arrange ment which you and Lyn discussed so openly at Bangor House cannot be carried out. 

 " Miss Harloigh- Margaret! what can you mean? How could I discuss this matter at 

 the Jones's? I had not spoken to you then; and your brother ? I do not know what to understand. You are augry because I spoke to him; it was as we drove in to Menzies. I asked him" 

 " I do not want to hear" 

 "But, Margaret!" and the earnest face of the sailor�the deep tones of his voice�made. her heart \\vaver. If it had not been possessed by the devil of obstinacy she would have hauled down her colours and for the long future agreed to sail under the lee of the gallant captain. 

 She stood up, and passing swiftly along the verandah went in through the hall door, and sending Tina out with hot coffee, she gaiued the garden by a Bide door. Mrs. Graham and Wyndham were easily found, and they came back to the verandah, where the three gentle men were standing. 

 Margaret dispensed cofice with trembling bauds�tlie thought in her heart all the time, " If he goed away�if I have gone too far� 

 what shall I do? 

 In long years to come Vivian declared the magpies' warbling always made him down hearted�gavo him an apprehensive fear of trouble ahead ; a confused sense of some thing wrong! how they sang that warm night at Paringa ! The Australian woodlands may be hchiud the age iu some respects�may fail to come up to the required standard in many points�but while the feathery top3 of the graceful young gums glisten in the clear moonlit air, and the magpies pour forth then melodious happiness in tones of such super natural sweetness, we need not sigh for the well-watered glades of Devonshire, or the pine-covered mountains of the New World. 

 The Grahams aud Captain Vivian were to travel in company, anu soon took leave, hut as they were doing farewells on the verandah Vivian came to Margaret, who stood a little apart, and in a low voice said� 

 " I cannot despair. If you would only let me explain myself! May I come over to morrow evening? You mu3t give me a chance!" 

 " No�do not come," was all Margaret had time to say, when her attention was claimed by Mr. Graham. 

 " I want to talk to you and your brother about Alice Macfarlane. I have thought of something she might do. I hear her husband is drinking in Sydney, and very nearly ready for the lunatic asylum! When will you be in?" 

 " We have promised to go to Hackney on Thursday early, and I will try to bring Lyndou up to the manse then." 

 When Vivian reached Bulla he paced the verandah for an hour, a weary, anxious hour, recalling all that had passed at Pariuga, wondering, hoping, fearing alternately, as is the established form of lovers, and before turning in he came to a conclusion very close to the truth�that mischievous tongues had done him this injury, and felt sure that if� no, wheu he was able to persuade Margaret to speak openly on the subject all would be made clear, and love would look out clearly again from those sweet eyes. He had seen it there more than once, the memory quickened his pace. A man endued (as women eay most men are) with a generous share of self-conceit, would feel keenly his position, and would be inclined to say� 

 If Bbe slight me when I woo, I will scorn and let her go! If she be not fulv for me, 

 What care I how fair sbo be. 

 But Vivian was not conceited, and the prize in view be considered worth any exertion. Having once pictured his life, glorified by the constant presence, the hourly companionship of this pure, beautiful woman, he could not easily be persuaded that he must henceforth "leave hope behind," aud coutinue his life on a very different stratum. I think he was scarcely the man to follow the example of Hymenmus.aud meekly follow within sight of the trailing skirts of the Athenian maiden in objectless adoration. No, Orpheus-like, he would brave the hideous horrors of the realm over which the gloomy Piuto reigns; but it should be to win for himself the "love that clingsabout a woman's heart," as Dean Russell put it. 

 How that old legend clings to our memorjr! The stalwart son of the Muse Calliope aud his love affairs; his splendid attempt to rescue Eurydice, frustrated, alas! by lus too eager, too anxious affection�to give a new reading to an old saying, "He loved not wisely, hut 

 too wellthat one longing look back at the slender figure just emerging from the lurid glare of Hades; how we tingled in every vein to find it was fatal to them both. And is my memory dimmed by years of distance, or did my youthful eyes grow misty as I first read how the white-robed vision laded into the shadowy recesses of that region where �aaer 

 Sine ruled the ruler, and her lover returned 

 isconsolate to mourn melodiensly on the 

 mountains of Thrace, till the women (not one of whom could tempt him from his allegiance to his dead love) with the ferocity always attributed to victims of slighted affection at last compassed his destruction. It takes some powerful influence to keep a schoolgirl awake, but I clearly remember one moonlight night at old Rugby. being haunted by the vision of a beautiful upturned face floating down the rapid waters of the Hebrus to the blue depths of theAigeanSea, and ceaselessly calling the beloved name � " Eurydioe I Eurydice!" 

 As Vivian entered the house he found on the hall table his letters and a parcel: the latter he opened eagerly, perceiving Marga ret's peculiarly clear caligraphy on the ex terior. To his astonishment he perceived the bouquet-holder he had sent to her the evening of the hall at Bangor House: a note, too, dated from Elmhurst the evening after the garden party at the Swindons� 

 "My dear Captain' Vivian�I returnyou . the bouquet-holder; aal never accept present* of this kind. Many thanks for the flowers,� Yours very truly, Marqabet Hablkmh.'* 

 If ever a man felt that his 'good angel had takes flight and forsaken him and hie interests Hubert Vivian was that unhappy individual; but after a short reflec tion, aided by the soothing influence of another cigar, he - came to. the con clusion, that now if ever, he must act up to the motto of his family and " nil desperan dum." On Tuesday evening, at the' Hacknev ball, if not befoie, he would surely be able to moke an opportunity for coming to a clear understanding with Margaret; ana he would 

 find out what influences bad been at work in the girl's mind, so to change her manner and apparently her feelings. Surely he had not been mistaken, but nad watched the soft colour rise in the pretty face as he drew near, had seen the long lashes droop over the deep brown eyes before he caught more than a glimpse of the love-light kindled there. Never was a man less given to Belf-love, but aB he recalled the conversation in the garden at Elmhurst, and remembered how the soft 

 white hand had remained in his willingly, 

 how in her surprise at some remark of ins she bad raised her eyes to his, and he had surely read there�was it not love�the first shy, timid love of the sweet pure maiden heart, which hesitated long before giving up the keys of the fortress, hitherto so carefully guarded. Yes; he felt again sure that if onlv he could obtain one half-hour's talk 

 with Margaret he could make his case good, and secure the prize for which his soul longed.
