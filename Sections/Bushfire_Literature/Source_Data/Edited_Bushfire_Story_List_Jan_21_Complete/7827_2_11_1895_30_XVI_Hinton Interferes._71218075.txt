GHAPTEOt XVI. 

 Hinton Interferes. 

 Hinton, left Lee's bedside in � state of righteous indignation .that was res trained from instant action only by the thought of Miriam. He longed to be doing something, anything, to expose the heartless scoundrel who could stoop to any crime. On his way out the nurse spoke to him-spoke tb him of Lee, saying how fortunate it was that Constable Henry had captured him, and that he had not murdered that excellent officer on the lonely coun try road. 

 Like many ordinarily calm, sweet tempered men, Hinton, when really roused, was a<pt to lose all control over himself. All the old Injuries he had received from Rexford, all the old taunts and insults, came surging up in his memory, and the thought of the last cowardly action tilled him with contempt and wrath immeasurable. 

 Was it not through Rexford that he and Mabel had been separated all these weary years-that he had been driven away as an exile from her fa ther's house; through h inn th at she had come to spend the best years of her life in this desolate place? And Muliana �-proud, high-spirited Miriam -how he had wronged and shamed her-and now to crown all he had at tempted, in cold blood, a cowardly murder in order to secure himself from the consequences of his crime. Yet he was respected and trusted, while the unfortunate victim was feared and shunned like some savage. Half mad with these burning thoughts whirling through his excited brain, he determin ed to go at once to the station and have it out with Rexford once for all. Pie would compel him to confess his . own crime and Lee's innocence, and 

 promised to leave the place at once. And so he asked the nurse the way to the station, and tore down the main street with the intention of having it 

 out at ouce. 

 His way lay past the office of the "Wirnmeroo Independent," but he looked neither to the right or left, but went on up the hill to the station. 

 Parker, was, however, just coming out of the newspaper office, and was saying good evening to Billidge, with whom he had had a long conversa tion. The lawyer saw his friend tear ing down the street, and made after 

 him. 

 "Where are you going?" demanded Parker. "Where, in God's name, are you going?" as he ran after Hinton. 

 "To him-to the station," was the re ply, and on Hinton went faster than 

 ever. 

 "Don't be an ass; don't be an Infer nal ass!" said Parker, as he -hurried to keep u�p with him. "Stop . . : I tell you . . what good . . . can you do . . only .do harm ... don't be a fool I tell you." But he had all he could do to keep pace with Hinton, who answered never a word, Taut set his teeth harder if possible, and kept his eyes fixed on the police-station on the hill, as, half walking, half running, he kept on his way. 

 "I tell you, Hinton," said Parker, as they ascended the narrow path, "you're going to make an awful fool of your self. If you want him to be arrested you are simply giving him notice to clear out, and af you don't want to have Mm arrested you have no power over him-unless-unless you mean .to fight him," finished the lawyer in an altered tone of voice, for he had caught the expression on Hinton's face, and. it had frightened him. 

 But on Hinton went, unanswering. "Oh, well," thought Ms friend, "as there is no use stopping him, the only thing ls to stand by him." So they went on till they reached the station. 

 Roxford was in the little white-wash ed charge-room making out some de partmental return. He heard the hasty steps of the two men grinding on the gravel, and looked up. Almost as he did so they were inside. 

 "You scoundrel!" cried Hinton, as he almost threw himself into the room. "You are found out!" 

 Parker, seeing there was nothing else for him to do, stepped forward and gripped his friend by the arms. 

 "Take it coolly," he said. It was tho only thing he could do, and, strange to 

 say, it seemed lo take effect. 

 Hinton turned his head and laughed 

 in iiis friend's face. 

 "You're right," he said; "I will take ic coolly. Let go my arms, Parker, I am quite cool. Do you think I am go ing to let this fellow escape through my impatience? Do you think that after the lives the scoundrel has ruined by his infernal coolness, I will let him es cape at last through my heat?" 

 It ex ford, behind his desk, with a wooden bar between himself and the other two, quivered a little at first, but soon recovered his nerve, and gazed with the utmost unconcern at the two 

 men. 

 "Listen to me," he said; "this lock-up is scarcely the place for a drunken man to come to. If you are wise," and ho turned to Parker and smiled, "you will take your friend away, or else I shall be compelled to lock him up." 

 At this Hinton again broke out. "Locked up!" he cried; "you shall be locked up and tried for murder, if there is law enough in the country to get at such as you-bigamist and mur 

 derer!" 

 Parker looked up quickly at hearing the last word. How could Hinton have learned the truth of what had been only a shreAVd surmise of his own? 

 "You are certainly drunk," replied the trooper, as he composedly took out his watch and looked at it, "but in memory of old times-pf the dear old times-I will give you three minutes to clear out of the place, and then if you don't go I shall certainly lock you up." 

 "1 tell you this: I will stop in. this place until another constable comes in, and when he does I will charge you with bigamy and attempted jnurder, 

 and I swear that if you leave |he place 

 or dare to touch me, I will choke tho life ont of you." 

 It had grown dark, for the sudden Australian sunset had come on, and the heavy clouds which had been ga thering during the day Md the light of tlie setting sun. Perhaps it was only the shadows of the deepening greyness of the evening that crossed Rexford's face as Hinton spoke. Well it was for Hinton that Parker's hand was on his arm and Parker's voice told him in a whisper to be cautious for the sake of others, if not for his own. 

 "This has gone so far," put in tho lawyer, quietly, "that it must needs go further. My friend is excited, of course, and I propose to take him away directly. But clearly understand that your threats as to locking up aro idle ones. We are the persons to take action, not you, and you may be quite sure that we intend to do so." 

 "Rexford's manner changed. "Look 

 here," he said, in conciliatory tones, "I've no doubt you're a very decent sort of fellow, but you've mixed your self up in a squabble which does not concern you in the least. No doubt Hinton has been pitching you a tale, und you've started out to back him un: hut there are always two sides to'a question. Would you like to hear tho other side of this one?" 

 "Will this scoundrel's fellow-cousta ble never come?" muttered Hinton, go ing to the door of the station to look for the other policeman. 

 "Say Avhat you have to say," answer 

 ed Parker. 

 "It's a very simple matter," went on Rexford. "I suppose you know thar Hinton there and myself quarrelled about my sister before we left Ens land? Of course, he is very bitter against me, and I suppose, with the aid of that poor devil in the hospital, who, being a bad lot, has necessarily no love for me, has trumped up sonni yarn to throw discredit on rae, and which can only result in Hinton getting himself and others into trouble." 

 Hinton laughed quietly, but there was such a bitterness in the laugh that Parker got closer to him, and the grey shading on Rexford's face grew greyer, 

 and his voice was low and husky as he continued 

 "If I wanted to be dramatic, like' Hinton, I could humor him. I could pretend that his charges were true. If 

 he accused me of starting the last bush , fire, of passing the bogus, notes which are flying round, or anything else his disordered fancy prompted him, I could admit it all fearlessly. Knowing him as I do" (and here he spoke slow ly and distinctly), "I could admit any thing. . He forgets that the woman lie professes to love is my sister, and that she loves me. Yes, I could admit every thing and dare him to strike me, and .then go to my sister and tell her how he had treated her only brother. Do you think," he went on, turning to wards Hinton, and hissing the words at him across the wooden bar, "do you think she will let you lead her to the altar after you have revenged yourself on her brother, and thus injured her brother's wife-her own dearest friend?" 

 The lawyer had realised this alt along. He knew Hint Roxford was just the man lo grasp the situatioii 

 exactly, but Hinton, blinded by bis an ger, bad for the moment forgotten the man was Mabel's brother; but now it came upon him, and he sank into the only chair in the station-house, and buried his face in his hands. 

 "But 1 am not disposed for a farce fo-night," said Rexford; "go away, col lect all your evidence, and come back here to-morrow at this time, and then I will tell you exactly what ,it is worth and what I haive to give you in ex change for it." 

 Hinton got up. "The man is per fectly right," he said to Parker; "I have turned the affair into a farce. Let us go away." He walked to the door, and Parker followed him out of 

 th� station. 

 But when they were gone the troo per's coolness apparently deserted him, for after walking np and down the sta tion for nearly an hour, he called his fellow-constable and asked him if Mrs. Brown could give him a cup of tea, as he had a little business to transact, and wanted to go some distance out of town quietly without bothering his wife, who had not recovered from the death of the child. Presently they brought him the tea, and then he went for a long ride. Although it was late when he got back to the town, he was still unsettled in his mind, for he pass ed what little remained of the night In a restless sleep on a bench in the po lice-station. To the wonderment of Constable Brown and Mrs. Brown, af ter sharing their breakfast on the fol lowing morning, he again mounted his horse and spent the greater part of the day riding. 

 "He must have had a row with Mrs. Henry," said Mrs. Brown; "she's a stuck-up sort of woman, and I don't wonder"at it. I don't believe he's been 

 nonie for hours."
