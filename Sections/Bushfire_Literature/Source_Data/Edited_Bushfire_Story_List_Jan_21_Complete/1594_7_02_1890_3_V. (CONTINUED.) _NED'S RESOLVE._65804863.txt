"Mistress Martin did not say no word about it afterwards. She came up on deck a few times, and asked me more about the captain, and how he looked, and what ihe was doing when hle got his wound. Aud of course I told her nall about it, full and particular, and how he had muade every one elsolie down, and stood there at the tiller as we went under the stern of the Spaniarl,ad thatnone ofus know hlewas hit until It was ill over ; and how we ihad operod ithem with our four carronadcas and aou it. Dut mostly she stopped down below tillwe hautl or wind andtsheaded up the Zuider-Zeo towards Enlhuioen." i tVell, now it is all over, Peters," Nod said " there is no.doubt that it in botter alit should havo heard the news from you instead of my Sfather having to tell her." A -LIn~nIoiPthut it lrTltovOr.aouoono;'but onaever Pgain will John Petors undertake a job -where ho iugot to keep his mouth shut when a -woman wants to get somoething out of him. Lor' bless you, lad, lthey just see right through you; and you feeool that, twist and turn as you will, they will got it out of vou sooner or later. There, Istarted wito my mNinid quite mndo up that orders was to ho ninyod, osid that your mother was to be kept in ttheo dark about ot till she got hero; and I had considored with myself that in such a case as this it would bono great weight upon iuy conscience if I hol to make up somankiuid of a yarl that woutd satisfy her; and yet in throoee minutes after shie gotma into that cabin she was at the bottom of it all." "' You see, she has bee already vary utnosy at not heairiiig for oo long fromo tier fattier and brothers, 'Peters; and that and tihe fact that ay father lout spoken openly against tih Spanish osthoritio set her upon the track, and enabled liher to put the questions stritightfor wardly to you.' "I suppose that was it, sir. And now, has the eaptlli said aniythiing about what is going to ho don wit the ship till li gets well o'" " Notlhing whatever, Petors. He lhas spoken very littlo upon any subject. I know he lihas been ertremsely ailixiolus for my oother to arrivo, though ho lhas said but little about it. I fanoy that for the last few days he lhas not thought that lie should recover. But the doctor told ao I must iot ho uineay uton that ground, for that lie wan noo extremsoly as oak, and mon, oven the bravest and most resolute when in aIonlth, ur apt to take a gloomy view when ut terly weak and prostrate. Itls opinion was that my mnotler'n coming would probably cheer hiin lip andt cnabli him to rally. "I think, too, that he ihas been dreading having to tell hier the terrible news about her fathers and brothers; and now he knows that sho is aware of that it will be a load off lhis mind. Besides, I knowo that for his sake tho will be cheerful and bright, aod with lihr and the girls withi him, ho will feet as if ott honoe. The doctor told rue that the mind has a great influence over the body, and that a man with cheerful surroundings hald five chances to one as against one amonr gst stralngers, and with no one to brighten him up. I have no doubt that as soon as heo gets a little stronger he will ar range what is to be done with the brig, butI am sure it will be a long time beforo ho can tako the commrand again himself." "Ay, . fear it will bo," Peters nagroeed. " It isa pity you or, ist four or live years older, Fastor rot. 1 donit say thatlcouldn'tbriou tl, sahi into any port in Holland; for having boom sailing backrurdn and forwards hor, man and boy, for over thirtyyoars,I could doo prottynigl blindfold. But what in the good of tringnllga ship to a port if you have not got the head to see about gottin a cargo for her, and cannot roead the bills of ladiug or so much aos ignd your I namo to a custom'slist. Nd; uriutor Nod, I anrit fit fora captain," that is qiiito certain. But though I would not mind oerving under another till your father is aditto take lihargeo gain, I could not work on hoard tho Venituro untder another for ood. I have gut a litlo money saved up, aond would rathr bury a share in a omall coaster and be my own master lioro. After serving under your Sfather for nigli toenty years, I know I should not got on with anlothr skipper no *how." " Well, Poetrs, it is no use ntalking it over now, becaus I havo no idea wohat my father's decision will be. I hope above all thing that he will bo able to takn command again, hut I havo great doubts in sy own mind wheitlr ho wilt ever do so. If hi had loot tie log below thI kneo it wonld nist so much have ,satteroed; but as it in, with the whole log stilt, he would have groat ditticilty ini gettiig about, especially if thbe ship orwas rollinio it heavy si." JohnaPts ers shook Ido hleadgravoly for this wan tho very thig lihe had turned il his mnino over and over again during the voysge to and from England.

I told the merchanots if tlhery ut their goods oh board I nist mail past the ports and sako straight on to Eubliiron ; for that first of alt I must bring Mistress Martin to t1e captain, but that I would go rutnd and disclnrgs their goods as soon as I hai brought lihr here. t was onrly on othese terms I agreed to take the cargo." "L That will do verywoll, Peters. I will go onboard with you at obie, and see to s whom your goods are cosigned hero, and wavrn them to receive them at once. You will got tlem on shore by to-night, and then to-liorrow I will sail with yaou to Leydeth ahnd the fague, anid aid you in gettilng your cargo into thi right hand leoroe. Now that my mother and th girln are hiero my fatoher will be ablo t spare me.

Of scourse, if he wihes t to stay on booard her, I shall obey - his ordors, wpltel hr you or anothr are tIle captain." "tWhy, of course, yen wilt remain on boord,-faoter Nod. What else should you do?"' -. " Well, Poteor, my own mind is set upon joining the Prince of Orange and ll'hting against the Spaniards. lofone I nailed' from bome I told ny sisters that was what I wao ,lnging-to do, for L could scarce sleep for <thinking of all the cruelties and masacres that :; theyyhad arried out upontho podple of the '-Netherlands who are, by ty.mothorsa sido, my -Istnfolk.

 Captain Martin did not answer for some little time then he slid: " No, N'ed, I think you had best return hIere in the ship. By that time I shell, I hope, be capable 01 thinking matters over, and deelding upon uy arrangomenta forthe future. Whes is rotors thinking of sailing?" SBy to-morrow'morning a tide, sir. iHe sanid that ho couldbe ready perhaps by this evening; but that unless you wished it otherwise, �o would tnot strt till to-morrow's tide, as he will thereby avoid getting out between the islands at night." "'t'hnt will be the best way: Ned. If the winds are fair hie will bho at thle IIague before nithtfccll." Tie day aifter lis returnt Ie took n eppeor tunit of speaking to hIis mother cs to Iis wiash to tako serice wctl the Prince of Orlange, ad to aid in the efforts that tice people of lice Notherlands were making to free thocmselves from their persecutors. IIit mothler, as he feared would be tie ease, expressed a strong opposi tion, to his lIsts. " You are altogether too young, Ned, even if it were a matter tlhat concerned yoe." 1tIt does eoncern mo, imotcer. Are you not Dutch ? andc tlhocglh I was born in Englanod and a subject of the cqueen, it is naturalt I should feeool warmly in thie matter; besides we know that many Eoglishare already coming over hero to help. Have not the Scpansh killed my rela ties, auid unless tlhey are driven back tilec wcll altogetlr extermicate tlIe Protescnts of lice Notherlands? Have they not already been doomed to death, oeard eso of ago or sex, by rhilip's proclamation) ascd do not tlceSpassceincr whenover they capture a town slay well nigh all withinit?" " That is all true enough," hiis motheragreed, Sbut prves in no way that you are a it age to msddle fis the affair. - '11 I am sixteen, mother; nd a boy af sixteen who ham been years at sea is as strong as one of eighteeno brouhlt up on the land. You have told me yourself that I look two or three years older thanI am, and nmethinks I have strength to handle pike and axe." 1 That soay be perfectly true," said Mrs. Mlartin, " but oven supposing all other things were titting, Iow could wve spare you now when your father will be montlhs befor Ie can follow cis trade on the sea again, even if lie is able to do so ?" cc Thatis the thing, motlher, that weighs with me. I know not what any father's wishles may be in that respect, and of course if he holds thlat I can be of use to him I must give up my plain; bed I want you to cct ascy rats mecntcon it to Ictn. Ansd I pray you not to add your objectioccs, bat to let hlin decide oat the matter according to his will." "There wdll he no occasion for mo to add objections, Ned. I do not think your facther will lister to such a mad sclheme for a muomcent." It was sot until tlhree or four days later that IMrs. IMartinl, seeing that her hlusband was stronger sand otter, and was talkini as interest in wicat passed icn the hcouse, fulfilled hcer promise to Nod by telling his father of Ihis wishes. " You must scot be angry with him," selo said whon sire hlad finishecl, " for he spoke beautifully ancd explressed himself as perfectly wiiling to ield Ine wishes to yours in lie Itold him, of course, it ceas msad. brained scheme, and not to be thlought of. Still, as he was urgent I should lay itbefore you,I promised to do so." Captain MIartin did not, as his wife expected, instantly declare that such a plan was not to be thought of even for a srmomet, but lay for some ticno apparently turniung it over in his mind. cc I know not quite what to say," he said at length. " Not know whlatto say 1" Iis wifreropeated in surprise. 1 WWhy, lhusbancd you surely causot for a mnmect thlins of allowisg Ned to emhbark in so wild a business." " There are rmaly Engliesh volunteers coming ever; some of them sot mouc older, and not so lit in bodily strength for the work as Ned. Ite has, too, ihe advanttage of speaking the language, and can pass anywOhere as a native. You are surised Sollphio, at my thinking of this for a moment.;, 1 But what wouldyou do without 1im ?" she exclaimed icc astonishment. " That is what I Iave been tlhinking as I lay hers. I Ihave been troubled what to do with Ned. Ho is too young yet to entrust with all the business of the ship, and the merchants here and at home would hesitate at doing business witlla lad. Moreover, ie is too young to be first mateonbnardthebrig. Petors isaworthy man and a good sailor, but he can neither read nor write und knows nought of bneiness and, therefore, until I am able, if Iever shall be, to return to the Good Venture, I soust hIaveo a goodseaman as first mate and a supercargo to manage the lbusiness affairs of the ship. Were Ned four years older, he couln be at once first mate and supercargo. There, you see, your objectioss that I need him fulli Sthe ground. As to other reasoas I will think them over, cuad speak to you another time." CIIHAPTER VI. TIcE I'cRINCE OF OLANGE. Mistress Martin was mnuch trouble) in her micnd by what seecomed to her the unaccountable favour with which her husband had received Ned's proposal. She did not, however, allow aly trae of tlcn feoling to escape hier, nsor did she meoniosn to N ed lia.eho bladas yet sicokenitsc to his wishes to his father. The ncoxt dy Cap. tano Martin himself renewed the subject. 1 I told you yesterday, Sopie, wly in my opinion Ned vould at present ho of little aid to me in the matter of the brig, and macy even go further icn that respect and say that I think for a time it will be just no well that he were rcot on board. IHaving to established position there would be no special duties for him to perform. Now, I Ihavo maule a point of telling him all .about the consignments and the rates of froiglt, and hIave encourcacel him always to expreas his opiuion freely on thlese matters mn order that his intelligoence night tlhoreby bh quickened ; but if he so expreesset himself to the ouporccrggo the latter might vell takoe ffence and dificeulties arise, therefore before you spoke to mo I had quite resolved that it vould he beet Ice should sail no more in the Good Venturo until old enough to come itn and take the place of second moate and supercargo, but that I would pilace him with some captain of my acqlusintance, undor whlom ice ould continuo to learn Ihis duty for the next three or four years." '1 That is a good reason, doubtlesso Ihusband, wlhy Ned should scot sail in tIcs Good Venture, but surely no reason at all why he should carry out this mad fance of his." "No reason, t gprant you, wife; but it simply shows that I happens at this moment we can well spare hlim. As to theo main ques. tion, it is a weighty one. Other young Englishmon Ihave come out to fight for the Netherlands with far less cause tlhan he Ihas to mix tlhemselves up in its affaire. MIoreover, and tlhis principally, it is borne stroogly upon my mitcd that it may be tlhat this boy of ours is called upon to do good secrvie to IRollancd. It seems to me, wife," ho went on, in annwer to the look of astoncishment upon his vife's face, "tha the hand. of Prov deuce is in this mattor. - _ "lhave always felt with you a hatred of the opaudards and a. deep horror at thoe e rulis they~sreo�perpeteating upon this unicappy people, and have thought that did the queen gore the order fcr war against them I would gladly adventure my lifo and ship in such an entorprtee; further Ilcas- that I have scot gone.

Hiis worth and manner, too, had much impremsed

That the request she had ipromised to mako in his ltanm to li:s father lhad uanLything to do with tlhetrinatter did tiot cater his imind. Indeed, he had begun to regret that lie hald inade it. Not that hlis itilteuso lotgitg to takelu servico against the SpaniardsLl wLas i any way tbotod, but lie felt it was aolfilsh, nowe that lie miight for the first time be of real use to his parents, for him thus to propose to embark ilt adventures oin his own acouint. lise had tasked his mothier to put the miatter before his father, ibut hlie ihad suce even a hope the latter would for a moment listet to the lproposal. The eexttomornitig otter hreakfast as lie colic about to start fora stroll to the wiharf to have a talk with Peters, his mnother said to him quietly : " Put aside your cap, Ned, your father wishes to speak to you." She spoke so gIavoly that Neod ascended the stairs in some piurturbation of spirit. Doubt less she lhad spolken to Ihis father, and the latter was about to rate hinm sevUrely for hlis folly in proposing to desert his duty, and to embark in so wild an adventure as that hie had proposed. He was in no way reassured by the grave tone il which his father said: " Place that chair by my bedside, Ned, and sit doiwn; my voice is not strong and it fatigues te to speaki loud. Ad now," lie went oft when Neil cith It a tiefaced expressions lont seated himself ho the bedsido, " tlhi desire that your mother tells too of to fight against the Spaniardo for a time in the service of the Prince of Orango, how did it first come to you F" " Eversince I heard the terrible story of the persecutions here," Ned replied. " 1 said to myself then that whenl I came to be a mats I would take revenge for these horrible murders. Since then thie more I have ioheard of the persc cutions that tlhopeople hIere ihave suffered min the cause of their ru:igion, thre more I have longod to be able to girt theta em l iu aid as Icould. I have spmoket of it over andl over a'aioi to my elders; but I.tlu it ot think that I eItould over have ventured to put toy desire into words, had it niot been for the terrible news we learnt at Vordwyk. Now, lhowver, that they" have killedl my grandiather and uncles and have wountded you, I long more than ever to join the latriots lere; and of course the hknowlodgo that many ou EnlglishtIen were romnng out to Brill a Flushing as volutnteers added to my desire. I said to myself it they who are Etnglish are ready to give their lives in the cause of the IHollanderos, whry should not I, who speak tlheir languago aod tam of their blood P" " You have to desire to do great deeds or to distinguish yourself ?" Captain lMartin asked. " No tfather; I have never so tmuch as thought of that. I could not imagine that I, ats a boy, could be of any great service. I thought I might, pierhap, binig so young, be able to be of use it passiuigaong the Spard and carrying messages wlore Ia man could not get though. I thought sometimes I mighit ioperhaplls trry a wuraingt in time to enable women to cecaps with their children from a town that was about to be hboloegured, and I hoped that if I did stand' t the rauks to face the Spndiard I should otiisgrace my nation and blond. I ktnow, fatlhor, thiat it was pro. sumptuous for mtoe to thlink that I could be of any real use; and if you are against it I will, of course, as I tolid y niother, submit mysalf cheerfully to your wishes." "I am glad to seea, Ned, that in this matter you are actuated by right motives, and niot moved by any boyish idea of adventure or of doitg feats of valour. This is no ordinary war, ty boy. There is nothingottheo chivalry of past times in tInt straggle here. It in onis of life atnd death-grim, earnest, aid determined. Ott one side is Philip witlh the hosto of Spain, the atest power in Europe, determited to cr out the life of these poor provinces, to stamp out the religion of the coutntry, to leave tiot onomana, woman, or child alive whorefuses to attend masns and to bow the kiteo before the Papist imnages; on the other side you have a poor peoopl tenanting a land snatclhedl from the sea, and held byrcotstiot ind etduring labour, equally dotermined that they will itot ibjire tleir religiot, they will trit permit the ItInuisi tion to he establislied asotig them, sol roaidy to give lives, lhomes and all in the cause of religious liberty. They have tie thought of throwingoff their aIllegiance to Spait, if Spain will but be tolerant. The Prince of Orange issues his orders uand proclamations as the stadtholder and lioutn:antt of the king, and declares that lie is warring for Philip, and designs oDly to repel thse nhoi, by their per secutioti atrd cruelty ire dialiotiouring the royal cause. " Thin cannot go on for ever, and in time the Netherlatids will bie driven to entreat some other foreign tmonarch to tike them undetr hie protection. Ini this war there is nio tailk of glory. Metn are lighting for their religion, their homes, their wives atnd families. They know tlhat the Spaniards lshow neither quarter nor mercy, and that it is scarce more than a lquestion betwenu death by the sword and death by tortureutid hiangitig. There is no tercy for prisoners. The town that yields ott good con ditiotns is sackedt and destroyed as is one taken by storm, for in no case have the Slaniards ob served the colnditions they have osaile, deemititg oatlis taken to hliretics to be in no cay bindaig on their consciences. "Thus, Ned, tlhose who embark upon this warerigago int a struggle in wlhich there is no hotour nor glory, nor fame nor reward to be wonet, but one in which almost certain deatlh stares themt in the face, and which, so far I call see, can end only in the annihilatiotn of the people of this country, or in the expulsion of tle Spaniards. I do not say that there is no glory to be gainled; but it is not porontal glory. Initolf, not cuse was ever more glorious thatn tlhat of ineti whio struggle, niot to conqiser terri. tory, tot to gather spoil, not to gritify ahbi. tiotr, but for freedom, for religioti, for hIearth and ihome, and to avtenge the countlessaitroei. ties inflicted upon them by their oppressors. After what I have said, do you still wishl to mu bark upois thio struggle f" " lo wish it, fiatlr," he said firmly. " I desire it above all things, if you and my mother cami spare me." Captain Martian then repeated to Nod the reasons that he had given his wife for con sotiting to his carrying out his wishes-tie fact that there was no place for him at prtesent on board thire Good Venture, the oath of vetnganca upon the Spaniards that Ite had taken, and his impressiont that although he himself could not carry out thatoath, its weight had beeoon trans ferredtto his sor, whiore deoire to take up the workthe hind inteudod to carry o.t1 just at this moment, seemed to him taboor spoeal detull of Providence. i Noa oned," he concluded, im you undeor stand threasontshnt sway se in giing my cetisotit to your deosre to do crart o aonnfour the mass of rwliioh asid liberty. wdo n poso that you srtoeld at prastit aneteally take op arms tanet I qwmtitot ou are strong eiugh to wield.

IHis father'o words had not shaken his determination, although ttey had depressed his enthusiasmni; but as he picod up and down, with the fresh air fromt the sea blowing upon his cheek, the feeooling of youth and strength soon set the blood dancing through his vmeins again. His checks flushced u d his eyes brightened. There is no hlonour and glory in the etrugglo," Ice said. " Did notthe people, old and youing, pourout to the Crusades to wrest Jerusoale froct the hands of the iifidels. This isa moore glorious task. It is to save God's fol lowers frotic destruction; to succeour tIhe op pressed; to fight for women icndchildren as well as for men. It is a holior and nobler object than that for which the Crusaders fought. Tohey died by hundreds of thousands by hoat, by famine, tlhirst, and the swords of the eieoy. Fewof those who fought everreturined home to reap glory for tceir deeds; hut there was honour for those who foIll. And in the same spirit in which even women and children left their hlomcs, and wont in crowds to die for the Holy Sepulchre, so will I venturo lifo for religion and freecom here." An hour Iccter he returntodhome; hocouldsee that his mother had tean crying. " Mother," he said, " I trust you will not grieve over this. I hlave been thinking how the women of tIhe early days senot thlceir husbands and sons and lovers to fight for the Holy Sepulchre. I think that, thls cause is an oven greater and more noble` oico; anrtfoel suro that though you may be anxious, you will not grudge me to do my best for our religion and counitry people." cTruly I think it is i holy cause, riy hey; atnd after shat your fattier Iaselsaid, Iseuld not if i could say nay.

" I piromise you, mother. that then, or if at any timeuo before that you write cand acy to to come I1om0e, I will coce. " am contenct with thact," his mother said. That aitornoon Ned told Peterc what had been decided, and the folloswing miorning the latter had a long talk with Captain Martin, who directed himc to apily to the other owners of the ship to appoint lim r can able first msate, anid also to choose oneo of their clerks iii cwhom they Ihad conftidence to sail in the vessel is supercargo. ' The dloctors tell me, Peters, that in two or three monthsI cacy ie able to returnc horno andI to get about ou crutches; ibut they aidviso coo thait it will be at least canother four motustls before I can stralp oil a woodec log anid trust my weiglht to it. When I call co sliut, I sthall seco how I can got ibout. You heard from Ned last niighit that he is going to enter as a sort of volunIteer uilncder the Prince of Oriaacige O Yes, ho told me, Captain ctartin. ile is a lad of ticrit, ald if I were fifteen years younger I woculd go with hilmtu." "Ho s young for such work nsoyet,'' Captain Martin taid couhtfulti. " Ho is a strong youth, Captain Mactia, cnd can do a Uman's work. I[is trainintg cit sea has made Icim steady iand cool; scd I warrant cou, if hie gets into daniger, he will get out of it ci'ainiif tcero is It Echanice. I ocly utope, Cattuici J'artit, that the brush ire hacive batd with the Spaniards will not be our list, and that we too may be in the wiay of striking a blow at the Spcaciards." ' I hotro that we may, Peters," Captain IMarticn sad earnestly. My mind is as much bent upon it as is.Noid's; and Ii will tell you what must cit present be knoown only to yourself, that I have made up my mind that if i recover, and take command of the Good Venturoru again, I will buy up tihe other shares, so tchat Icani do what I like with hier without accountingf to iccy can. I need not do so much on board as used to do, but will get you a good second mate, and will myself only direct. Theo we will, aeat present, trade between London and the Netherlands; but if, as is likely onough, the Spaniards and IHollanders come to blows at sea, or the prince neoedls ships to carry troops to beleaguered towns, thac for a tine we rill quit trading and till join with the Good Venture, and strike a blow at sea." "TTt is giood licarihi , Capctain Martin." raters said, rubbing his hande. " I wcrract me you will not finnt one of the crow backward at that work, and for my part I should like niothing better than to ticklo a Spaniard who does not carry more than two or throotimnes ourowustrength. Tiholat fellow wasa gooddealI too big for us, but I believe if we Ihadstuck to him we should have beaten him iu the enid, big as he was." "Perhaps we might, Potors; but tihe ship was not mico to risk then, ind we had cargo on board. If, in the future, we meoet a Spaiicard when tho ship is coio to vectur, and our hold is clear, the Good Vecnturo shall not heow ihim tier stern I warrant you, unless he be big enough to eat us." On the followirg day the Good Venture set sail for England, and the bturgomastetr having receiveda mesrage from Captacin Mlrtin, pray. icg hibn to call upoan him, paid him a visit. Ca itain MaIrtin unfolded his son's plans to him, acd prayed him to furnish himn with i aletter to the prince recommending bitm as one who might hIe trusted, and who was willingi to risk his ifo upon any enterprise with rwhich Ihe might intrust him. This the burgomaster at onte consuetctd to do. " Younger lads thanlc hIe," Iheo said, " hIave fought stoutly oc the walls of some of our towrs agcinst tlhe Stpanii o ; anud sitce such is his wish, I loccict not ice till be able to do good sorvico. Alt Holliced tis heart how your chit boat off tic Doci Pedro acid the fact that thc lad is your son, and took part ic the light, will at onco commend him to the prince.

Anit doubt. less, os you say, tics fact that the lad is by his mother's side one of us, and that ho can con verse in both our langulae and yours with equal ease, is greatly t his favoutr. Totmor row I till furiisi him with lettors to tics princeo, and also to two or throegentlemcn of my acquainitance, who are in the pirince's counceile." Whe the biNrgomaster had loft, Captain Martin called Ned in.

The voyage wits rond without adsenture, and upvn landing Ned ad once made his way to the house occupied by the prince. There wore no guards aTIt the gate, or any sign of martial pomp. Tihs door stood open, and when Ned entered a page accoatled him and naked him his tbusiness. "I hlave letters for lthie prine," le said, a hih I e ray you to Ihacid to bin whscn Ice is at leisure.' " In tha case o woul gve to wai cig the-page replied, "for the prince is ct work from early mornig until eto at night. IHow ever, he is always open of access to thoss who desire to seon him, therefore if you will give sue the name of the writer of the letter you boar I will inform him, and yeou can then delives it yourself." A muinute later Ned was shlown into tle presenoce of the man who was unIdoubtedly the foremost of his age. Deom of at disatinguished family, William of Orange had been ibrouhlt up by a pious mother, aut at the ago of two scrod become a page cn ilhe family of the Emaperor Charles. So groat was the boy's ability, that at lifteen hce id become the intitate aind almost conftidential friend of the emperor, who wsie a keen judge of merit. Defore he reached tihe agno of twenty-one he was named commander-icc-chief of the army on the French frontier. lWhen the Emplreror Cicarles resigned, the prince wits ippoinld ho Philip to nuegetiate a treaty with trance, and had conducted these negotiations witlh extremoe ability. The princo and the Duke of Alva re mainedo in Franco as hostages for the execution of the treaty. Alva was secretly ongaged in arraniging an agreement between PIhiip iand Henry for tIse extiriation of Protcstacntieii, cund the general destruction of all those who held that faith.
