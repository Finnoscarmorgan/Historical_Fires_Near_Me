 Chapter VIII. 

 KB BBPTIMU8 BLAND. 

 When Mr Robert Binns heard of the marriage of bil beloved and his enemy, he was both sorrowful and indignant. In his vulgar way he loved Miss Manton, and jealousy and lore affect vulgar peoplo quite bb much as they do those of higher rank. Tho costermonger who cursei in rioh and copious Dorio at the desertion of Molly Jones, is giving utterance to the same sentiments as those whioh Mr Aubrey Vere de Vere pours forth when Lady Clara promoted, perhaps, by a feeling of remorse for the death of tho " peasant boy "?elopes with Auguste Chaesomari, to tho infinite grief of all her relatives. Othello and tho deceived cat's meat man Bay very much the same things, only the Moor talks poetry, and the purveyor of horseflesh kabobs remarkably bad prose. 

 Binns, grocer's assistant and poetaster, was as sore at heart aa if he had been heir to a dukedom, and descended in a direct line from one of William the Conqueror's desperadoes. He showed bis sorrow in a different way though. When Lord Lundyfoot was jilted by Miss O'Moro of Ballymore, his lordship followed his successful rival to Paris, and shot him through the lungs, with aristocratic disregard of the sixth commandment. When Hobbs (of Hobbs and Bullio, oheeBemongers, of Fetter-lane) dis- covered that HiBs Sophronia Gusset (of Labur- num Villas, Highgate) had thrown him over, in order to marry young Horace Tomkins of tbe Stock Exohange, he took to cold brandy-and water and cigars?a courso of treatment whioh eventually terminated in Whitcoross-street; while MacHirdio, the civil engineer, brought an action for broach of promise against his treacherous ladye lovo, and Boothod hil wounded feelings by the application of ?' one farthing damsges." 

 Binns, however, did none of these things. He wrote poetry?sad stuff most of it was, too, principally about graves, and billows, and blighted hopes, and lonely isles?but it relioved Binns. Tbe old woman whose duty it was to replenish tho brown bottle that contained a stump of a quill pen and lome black coagulated mud, presumed to be ink, was astonished at the quantity of that fluid consumed by tho melan- choly "auiitant." Binns was writing night und morning. He elaborated rhymes while 

 was packing up half-pounds of " moist," and would ruth away from the counter at intervals to commit to paper some more than usually brilliant image. Even when going round for orders, his grief would pursue him ; and while taking his daily turn at the coffee-mill he would groan in the spirit and compare himself to Ixion, whose woeB had been made known to him through a burlesque at tbe Strand Theatre and an odd volume'of Smith's Classical Dictionary. 

 lu the elaboration of his lamonts, and tbe attempt to tear this rooted passion from his heart, he was oesisted by a friend. 

 There were " rooms " over the shop, and in those rooms lived Mr Septimus Bland, reporter for the Morning Mercury. 

 Bland was a tall thin man, with a wiry head of hair, that was always erect and "parting"� lest. He was bony, and cadaverous, had a deep Tetonast voice, wrote shorthand to a miracle, quoted Shakespeare and the poets ad libitum, dressed in rusty black, carried his handkerchief in his kat, greasy paokages of bread and meat in his coat-tail pockets, wai very shortsighted, very unpractical, and the best hearted, kindest inoffensive oroature that ever vegetated upon three poundi a week. 

 Poor Bland began life with a pretty Devon- shire wife, and a large stock of English litera- ture and inexperience. Ai a natural consequence, he went to tbe bad. Ho fell gradually from the writer io magazines to the reporter of Sunday papers, then to the picker up of odds and endi for the "dailies." His style of Magazine writing wai too old-fashioned for the preient day?too much like the Spectator, or an odd page in the Rambler. Moreover his wife foll ill; and how could he write artioles when hia wife was dying ? The publishers, however, did not care about his wife or anybody's wife; they wanted matter, and if Bland oould not Bupply st someone else could. By-and-by his wife died, and then Blund lived anyhow. He hired a little room in a little street in Hammersmith?a room littered with books bought secondhand at stalls, and the will covered with pictures from the Illustrated London Neat, pinned or pasted up. He managed for some time to make enough to par the rent of this place, and when he did not succeed in dining with one of his former friends, would buy himself a chop or steak in ioma small tavern or eating-house in the city, where . fae would sit, after satisfying his hunger, and 

 think of Johnson and Garrick, Boswell, and 8avage, and of the former race of tavern hunters. Recollecting, perhaps, those happy days when he came home to his wife, and, after a cheerful dinner and chat, somo play, ar poem or novel would he read aloud by that tender voice that should read no more on earth now; thinking of these things, he would sit in meian choly meditation; until tho greasy waiter, look- ing with unfriendly ojea upon the lanky man with tho thin face and tho ruBty black clothes, who never gavo him ponce as did tho other customers, would bustle about the table, sweep off imaginary crumbi, and otherwise hint that �t wai time for gentlemen who dined for nine- pence to seek some other place.to be miserable 

 in. 

 So Bland would arise, and taking his camlet cloak about him?a cloak that, like its owner, had seen better days?would sally forth and trudge through the rain and mud to Hammer- smith. On Sundays, he would?if summer? walk to Bulby Park and rejoice in tho song of the birds, and in the sight of the green trees and sloping lawns. 

 After his appointment to the Mercury Btaff, he naturally became acquainted with many men of decent income and hospitablo intentions, and these occasionally asked him to " tako a cut of 

 �utton." These " cuts of mutton " were the 

 only oases in his dreary life; and ho was un- reasonably happy when ho came acroBS them in his pilgrimage. Poor bouI, ho was like n child ?the moment was all in all to him. There was an instinctive refinement about tho man 

 that expanded under the influence of soft lights, Shttoring glass, and snowy cloth. Like many ? smother poor Bohemian, he found the enforced 

 companions of his poverty harder to bear than poverty itself. 

 The thousand and one little inconveniences and vulgarities whicb beiet the path of a " poor gentleman " galled him to the quick. He could ?ip a cup of coffee contentedly enough, if inch �Wing took place in a will-lighted room, with 

 hii 

 gentlemen seated in it; but he could not drink it with comfort out of a cracked teacup, in a sordid garret, with a harsh-voiced landlady below stairs clamouring with ber red-headed 

 brood. 

 When dining for ninepenoe in a comfortable eating-house, he forgot his tattered garments, Mb ragged linen, and his laok of shoe-leather ; but at home?where his window looked into a dirty court-yard, and where coarso sights, coarse words, and humanity with the seamy sido outwards, surrounded him?ho felt his burden heavy to bear. He was no Sybarite, but a man of unhappy sensitiveness, and his lot was cast in very unpleasant plaoei. 

 When he came into his fortune of threo pounds a week, be left his garret at Hammer- smith and came nearer civilisation. The room over the grocer's was to let, and as fortune willed it, Bland set up his tent there. He was quiet and unassuming, kind and good tempered, and an acquaintance?I had almoBt written, friendship had iprung up between the literary hack and the aspiring and love-lorn Binns. 

 Bland had heard the whole history of tho Carry-cum-Chatteris affair, of oourse, and would sit for hours listening with sad amuse- ment to the " assistant's " rhapsodies. 

 Binns had lurked about Dym street for a day or two after the ceremony, in hope of seeing his lost love once again; and after two days prowl- ing, had heard tho tidings of Cyril's flight. Bursting with the news, he hurried homo and 

 rushed into hiB friend's chamber. 

 " Mr Bland! Mr Bland ! be'B left her!" 

 "God blois mo!?whom?" cries the as- tonished Bland, laying down his book. 

 " Carry. That scoundrel has deserted her. He went away the morning of the wedding, and 

 has never come back." 

 " Never come back!" 

 " No ; and Mrs Manton's furious, and sho's crying fit to break her heart. God b-b-bleBB 

 her !" 

 " Sit down, my dear Boh. Now, don't go on like that. BIsbs the boy! Here, tako some 

 water." 

 And poor Bland bustled about in an agony of 

 soft-heartedness. 

 " It's some plot?somo cowardly plot to de- ceive her; I know it is. I knew no good would come of it. What did she want with a swell ?" cries the rejected one, striking the table in his energy of love and despair. 

 " Perhaps it ii a mistake." 

 "Mistake! Not it; it's uo mistake. Tho coward! He's left her ; that's what he's done." 

 " But why should he leave her ? What ii 

 his reason?" 

 "They laid something about & telegram carno up from the Mercury office. Just a blind, I'll 

 bo hound." 

 From the Mercury office!, Thoy would never telegraph from the office. Perhaps some of his 

 friendb want him." 

 " Friends! He ain't got no Monds?I mean any friends. I believe he's just a swindler and a sooundrel. He's gone and deceived the poor , girl. It serves that old cat right for plotting 

 and contriving. Oh! I hate her, and him, and everyone. I am the most miierable wretch on 

 earth." 

 And BinnB laid his head on the table, and gave vent to his vulgar sorrow. 

 " My dear Robert, calm yourself. You are very wrong to go on like this ; you are indeed." 

 " Oh ! it's all very fine for you, Mr Bland; but when a fellow's heart's brakon, it's?boo- hoo?a hard thing to mend again." 

 Bland looked down upon tbe squab figure of the poor lad with pitying face. After a pause, he laid his hand gently on his shoulder. 

 " Bob, listen to me a moment." Bob raised his touzled head. 

 " What mado Miss Manton fall in love with Mr Chatterii?" 

 "What? Why his rings and chains, and soentod handkerchiefs, and niminy-piminy ways, I suppose." 

 " If you do suppose bo, she is not worth thinking about." 

 " No ; it wasn't that," exclaims Binns, with sudden desperate energy of self-condemnation. " It was bocauie he's a gentleman, and I'm only a cad. He is clever?curie him?and I ain't; I know that. Why should ihe love me, a lout that wears a white apron, and can't talk English ? She's an angel, and I ain't worthy to kiss her shoe leather; but I love her ! Oh! Mr Bland, I'd die to-morrow if I could save her a moment's pain." 

 " Then why not snake younelf worthy of 

 her ?" 

 " Worthy of another man's wife!" 

 " I do not speak of that. You say that you lovo a woman that is above you ; that she despises you because you are less clevor and less polished than the man ibo has married. She can never be anything to you now; but you have it in your power to make yourself worthy of her love for all that. I know Mr Chatteris. He may be more refined?be can hardly help being bo?but he has not half your natural talents" ? Binns gasped ? " and I am sure he has not got your good hoart. I do not tell you this to flatter you, my boy, but because I want to see you make a name in th�t world where I hove fought so long and failed so often." 

 " Make a name! The name of Binns!" 

 " As good as many that shine bright in the list of England's horoes. Tour namo is nothing; your parson is nothing ; it is your heart that the world wanta to see. If you have noble thoughts, earnest aspirations, and honest faith, the world will not caro a jot for your name or birth. No!" orieB Bland, rising, his eyes dilating, and his sonorous voice ringing through tho sordid chamber, ?' genius is of no nation, of no name, of no person! It is as the mighty wind that sweeps over the ocean, carrying good or evil on its wings, men know not whence it comes, but they bow before its breath. You are a man; speak out a man's thoughts to men, and they will listen to you. The world is hollow, false, and selfish, but Genius comes with acorn in his clear eyes, power in hil upraised hand, and heaven's truth upon his lips; and the baie world, like a hound that meets bis master, orawls to his kingly feet in mute submission." 

 There was silence for a moment after this out- burst. Bland had dropped into his chair, and, with eyes fixed upon the lire, seemed to bc thinking of days gone by, when, perhaps, he thought that the mantle of heaven's menenger bad fallen upon his shoulden, and when he had hoped that the world would crawl to his feet, now, alas! blistered and weary with tedioui 

 travel. 

 Binni ut meditative; hil eyes were sparkling, his chest hearing; the esrneit purpose in bia face made one forget hit scorbutic chseka ind hil ill-fitting cont. Hid Carry seen him then 

 she might not have thought him ao vory " vulgar." 

 At last he spoke. 

 "How am I to do it?" said he, in a low voice. Bland roused himself. 

 " It is not an easy task," said he, sadly. " You have much to learn; much to forget. Fame is not won by dallying or repining. You must work for her, toil for her, bleed for her; and then, perhaps, just as she stretches forth tho crown, the leaves crumblo to dust beneath your trembling fingers, and tho withered wreath drops upon a tomb." 

 "But how to bogin?" 

 " Work, boy, work. Give up writing, and road. Study men, Btudy life, study nature. You are young, you havo energies, and industry." 

 " And these ?" asked Binns, pointing to a masB of papers?his poems?that wero pilod upou a broken chair. " Sholl I burn them ?" 

 " No; but put them away and road them six months hence. Pootry is always tbe first out- break of young minds; you were made to be a worker, not a dreamer. There is poetry iu work, lad, if you can find it; ay, more than in a sonnet to a eunsct or a flower. Thcro will be plenty for mon to do in the futuro. Tho people aro finding out that thoy aro men, not' masseB,' and thoy who would lead thom must prove themselves to bo worthy leaders of mon. Go out to them and show them a man's heart; thero are not many such to bo seen nowadoys. You sit hore with your grocer's apron round your waist, and dream of glorious suns, burning skies, waving trees, and plashing streams. Turn away your eyes from thc beauties of valley, field, and river, and look into tho faco of tho careworn, sickly laborer who pssBOB you in the streets. Ho is unpleasant to look upon, his coat is ragged, his hands dirty, bis face pale and begrimed with tho sweat and dust of bis daily fight for bread; yet I tell you that his life is a poom worthier to write and hear than all tho visions of your heated fancy. It ia a poem that, if you can interpret to men correctly, they will hail you as a poet great as iUsohylus. Tbe poetry of tho age iB work and usefulness. It walks, runs, throbs beside and around you. Boll up your apron and go out and seek it; you will find it ready to your hand ; no need to dream of palm islands or groves of myrtles. Wo do not want a poet to to sch us that thero is glory in the star or perfume in the flower; we want a man, with a man's heart, who can show ui tho pootry in our own livos ind our own nature. Thero, I havo done, you have made me forget that I am, too, but a dreamer, though I might havo dona some service 

 once." 

 And Blend's voice sank, and his head fell upon his breast. 

 The scrubby little grocer's apprentice rose softly, and turned to quit tho room. As ho reached tho door, his friend spoke again, in an 

 altered tone. 

 "One word boforeyou go. If, in the future, you mako yourself a name and place, and you find that this mau has deoeived and abandoned the woman you love, will you protect and guard 

 her?" 

 " I will, by ?-!" said Binns.

 MAKINO BNQ.TJIBIB3. 

 When the dog-oar deposited Dacre and Cyril at the Kirkminster Junction Railway-station', they found Mr Robert Calverly walking up and down the platform, with his brown hands deep in tho pockets of his gray shooting-coat, and a oigar botwoen hil lips. 

 " How do you do, Dacro !" " Going up to town, Bob?" 

 It was a peculiarity of the young Australian's that he was tho sort of mun that one involun- tarily addressu by his Christian namo. There are some men who ure specially constituted to be called by diminutives, and this was ono of them. He was io brown, honest, frank, and im- petuous, that tho ohances wero just fifty to one that you slapped him on the back after twenty minutes' acquaintance, and called him " Bob " 

 ever afterwards. 

 " Yob," says Bob, " I want to order somo things." 

 " Then we'li all go together. This is Mr Cyril Chatteris, of Matcham." 

 After tho usual bowing ceremony had boon gone through, Bob Calverly took a prolonged side look at Cyril. This was tho man, then, whom Dacre had hinted that Kate loved. Bob saw nothing loveable in him. The clear-cut features, and tho delicate handa were no charms in the Australian's eyes ; and ho looked in vain for a certain frankness of eye, and fearlessness of aspect, that he was wont to find in men whom 

 he called " friends." 

 Cyril, however, was remarkably agreeable, and having preserved a decent melancholy for some fifty miles, began to brighton np; and when the trio got out at Swindloton for inci- dental refreshments, the talk waa fait and furious. 

 Bob was enraptured at the barrack life at Kirkminster; and his Australian impression of the British army not being the best in tbe world, be was proportionately inclined to praise the bon-hommie, good-fellowship, and gentlemanly bearing of the majority of the mon iu the ?th. 

 "The boBt fellows I over mot in my life!" said ho, with enthusiasm. 

 " Yes," returned Dacre. " There is no medium in tho service. A man is either A 1 at Lloyd's, or ' Bnob,' stock, lock, and barrel." 

 " Well, I've known men who were neither," put in Cyril. 

 " Possible, but not probable. Arc you Bure that you really knew them? A dinner at the ' Rag,' or a luncheon at Richmond doesn't make you Jcnoxo a man, you know." Cyril reddened, Mentor was arrogating too much to himself. 

 " The ' British soldier,' as you call him, haa a fine time of it," put in Bob, who detected tbe sting in Dacre's reply, and was anxious to chango 

 the conversation. " He seems to me to live like a fighting-cock, with books, gymnasiums, and all sorts of things." 

 " Yes, roturna the sententious Rupert, shifting his railway rug more comfortably over his leg*. " Ho lives far too well. The Government makes a great mistake in pampering up her food for powder; ' I believe in the old regime, .when the British solder bad his life made such a curse to him, that ho fought like a fiend to get rid of it." 

 Bob stared aghast, and Rupert having watohed the effect produced by his nonsense upon tbe unsophisticated one, lit a cigar and smoked in calm defiance of the by-laws, 

 " What strange things you say, Rupert," laughs Cyril," you'll make Mr Calverly believe that English government officials are the hardest hearted fellows in Europe." 

 " Or the aofteit headed." 

 Bob laughed cheerily. " Chaff away, you fellowi, don't mind me. I've itood plenty of chaff in my life."

 " How long have you left Australia?" lays Cyril. - 

 " Oh, about twelve months. Wiih I was hack there again." 

 "Wish you were back P" 

 " Yob, I'd rather be riding a good horse after stock over the plains, than dawdling about London drawing-rooms." 

 "All you Australian fellows aro alwayi talk- j verj ing about' riding after stock.' I remember that j enm 

 fellow, Darling Downs, who used to givo thoso big feeds in Kensington Gore?ho was slwaya talking about stock, and stations, and wild cattle, and bush fires, and riding one hundred miles ii day for six weeks." 

 " Ah, that sort of thing is very easy to talk," says Bob, " but could he ride ?" 

 " Oh, yos, ho oould ride fast enough," lays Dacre, " tho u ghost Boat, and tho lightest hand of any mau I know." 

 "That's a different thing to sitting a buck jumper." 

 " Pooh, I'll find you a boy out of any hunt- ing stables in England that will Bit tho worst j buckjumpor ever foalod," says Cyril. 

 And they went off into a discussion upon the difference between bucking and plunging, and English and colonial saddles, and post-nnd-rail fences, and grate country, and hunting in tho shiros, and all the Australian horse-talk that arises between English riding mon and Bojournors from that land of freedom. By-and by the conversation turned upon other topics, and after a brief description of Bourko-street and a horso bazaar, Bob waxed oloquont, and entertained them for an hour with an aocount of a certain cattle muster on the Warrego, in which he ond a stockman named Dick took a 

 prominont part. JiiBt aa ho oame to tho part whore an old bull, who, having lagged bohind (tho custom of old bulls), was ubout to charge Dick's horse, who had put his foot in a crab hole, and Dick sprang up, all dusty from earth, and with a tremendous crack of his stook-wkip, challenged hiB antagonist to " como on," tho train ran into London Bridge station, and tho journoy was at an end. 

 " Where do you put up, Bob ?" Bays Dacro. 

 "At Limmer's." 

 " You must come and soo mo, old fellow; 37, Brook-street is my humblo roof." 

 " Dolighted!" . 

 " I tell you what, come up noxt Wednesday, st 8 o'clock, ond I'll have a few fellows to moot you." 

 " I think Ponsonby and Hetherington will bo up from Kirkminster on Thursday." 

 11 Then I'll loavo anoto'for them at tho ' Rog," and we'll fix it for Friday." 

 " All right, old fellow." 

 And tho Australian departed in a hansom for 

 Limmer's. 

 " Xou had bettor como with me," says Daore to Cyril. " We will dino togothor and talk over matters." 

 " Thanks; but I want to go up to my old lodgings to-night." 

 " Oh, to-morrow will do for that." 

 " Yes, I know?but?No, I think I must go to-night." 

 " By the way, where are your lodgings ? You were so cIobc when you wore under tho paternal cloud, that I never could find out where you 

 lived." 

 "I! oh, nonsenao. I lived in?in?in South Audley-street,"says Cyril, at a venture, and the moment he had said it, ho rcgrcttod that he had not spoken tho truth. What did it matter t 

 " Oh, indood! Woll then, if you won't oomo, good-by till Friday. Go down to tho Mercury. office, Fleet-street, oabby!" 

 Ab Cyril wont home, ho thought of many things. Of his now prospects, of bis pledge concerning the Radical newspapers, of Carry and Mrs Manton?thon ho thought of Kate. Thoy had parted without an explanation. She had been tuken by surprise at his sudden de- parture, and though her wistful oyes had seemed to ask for some reference to thoso few moments in the study, be had given none. 

 " What am I to toll her ?" thought ho, " and what am I to say to Carry ?" 

 He had not made up his mind upon either point, when the cab drew up at his wife's house, 

 and he was " at homo" once more, 

 "Good gracious! if it isn't Mr Cyril!" cried 

 Maria Jane. 

 " Mrs Manton bustled out. " Oh, so you've como back at last! Upon my word, this is nice goings on. A fortnight away from your wife, 

 and not so much ai a letter." 

 He put her aiido, and went into the parlor. 

 " Where is she?" 

 " Where is iho! Much you eire, I oxpeot. Why, gone down to the .Mercury-office to ask after you, Mr Cyril Ohatteris." 

 " To tho Iferoury-offioe ! she might have waited until I wrote" 

 "Waited, oh jes! How did we know you were ever coming back again ? Wait, indeed!" 

 Evon a* she spoke there was a hurried tread in the passage. Carry had soon tho cab draw up at the house, and leaving the arm of a tall thin man in rusty black, who had escorted her home, ran up tho steps, pushing past the port- manteau-laden cabby, burst open tbe door and flung herself into her husband's arms. 

 " Cyril, Cyril, my darling! you have come back again." 

 " Yes, and a nico timo he's been about it," ejaculates tho angry mother. 

 " Oh, Cyril, I have heard all about it at tho office. I am so torry." 

 " All about what ?" 

 " About your brother's death." 

 Who could havo told her? How did sho 

 know ? and how much ? He grow pale from' anger and fear. , 

 "Your brother's death!" exclaims Mrs Manton, who seemed to recognise the fact of Cyril's black olothes for tho first time. " Why, that Lieutenant Chatteris that the newspaper spoke abont wasn't your brother, waB bo? Carry and me saw the account of the steeple- chase in the Tiler, but we never thought as how it was your brother." 

 The deciiivo moment had come at last. He must confesi or deny, now or never. Carry had half withdrawn horself from bis arma, and was looking up into his face in blank amazement. He nerved himself for a bold stroke. Catching his wife in hil arms, be drew himself up and pointed to the door. 

 " Will you have the goodness to leave me alone with my wife, Madam." 

 Mrs Manton stared, bnt the ibock of the discovery bsd ebsken her nerves. She had believed Cyril to be " well off," but Mr Chatteris, the brother of a lieutenant of dragoons, and the son of a wealthy landed proprietor, was a very different paraon to the ion-in-law she had expected. She east one wrathful amazed look upon the flashing eyes, and outstretched finger of her daughter'! husband, and than with a 

 vioious toss of her cap-ribbonB, slammed the door upon her retreating figure, and the psir woro alone together. 

 " Sit down, my darling," says Cyril, after a moment's paueo, " I want to tell you something."

 Aa Bland was coming down the stairs of the dingy oflico in Fleet-streot tho day ofter his con- versation with Binns, be was etruck by the enmewbat unusual appearance of a pretty woman in tho freshest of autumn walking toilets, gazing disconsolately at the numerous doors, stairs, and windows of that uncomfort- able pile of buildings. 

 " Can I assist you iu any way, madam," asked he, with a bow. 

 '* Oh, yeB, sir ; if you would bo so good as to toll me whore I can find Mr Chatteris ?" 

 Mr Chatteris ! Bland took another look at tho timid figure. Could this be tho " Carry " ho 

 hud heard so muoh about ? 

 " Have I the pleasure of speaking to Mrs 

 ChatteriB ?" 

 "Yes," with such a blush that it almost mado Bland blush too. 

 " I am afraid that ho is not here," said he," I will aBk, though." 

 It was a curious question to put, but tho tall gentleman looked so kind and good that Carry ventured to put it. 

 " Do you know whors ho ii, sir ?" 

 " No, my dear; but I will ask if anybody 

 knows," 

 "He got a telegram from tho oflloo a fort- night ago, and ho has not como back since." 

 This stotemont tallied strangely with Binns' story, and the shabby reporter shook his hoad sorrowfully. 

 " Wait hero ono moment, Mrs Chattoris, and I will go and ask about it." 

 A hansom cob bad just driven up to the door, and Mr Rupert Dacre alighting therefrom, had caught the last sentence, Mrs Chattoria! Did ho hear aright ? 

 Bland had seen the private secretary of Lord Nantwich before, and had seen him wjth Cyril 

 too. 

 " Excuse me, Mr Dacre, but a lady is boro asking for Mr Chatteris. Do you know whore 

 he is?" 

 " He carno up to town with mo this morning. Ho wiib obliged to go down into tho country to attend his brother's Amoral." 

 Carry hoard, und hor suspicions of tho past 

 week seemed cruel. 

 " Thonk you, sir," said she to Bland, I will go home." 

 " Will you allow me to walk with you, madam ?" sayB Bland. 

 Sho looked up into tho kindly, haggard face, and Baw nothing hut courtesy and pity there. 

 " I shall be vory glad if you will," said Bbc. 

 Mr Rupert Dacre, pausing on tho stair head, 

 saw tho pair go away together. \\ OI

 " Cabby, I want to toll you something!" ' 

 Ho hardly knew, though, how to toll it. It ; D is not a pleasant task?that of tolling the . j1 woman you have married that you aro ashamed i & of her family, if not of herself, and many a better man than Cyril Chatteris would have felt his eloquence fail him at such a junoture. 

 He made a bold push for it, howevor. Ho had plungod into the flood and must sink or swim, B is heart half failed him when he lookod at his wife's frightoned eyes, where the love light had not died?yet. 

 " Carry, I have done a very foolish thing." 

 " How ?" 

 " I should have written to my father before I married you." 

 The little woman poutod. It did seem hard 

 that bil first sontence to her should be ono of regret. * 

 " Is ho angry with yeu, dear P" " Ho knows nothing." 

 " Oh, Cyril, have you not told him ?" 

 A vague terror possessed hor as she asked the quoition. A marriage was not a thing to be 

 concealed. 

 " Listen to me, darling. Tho telegram that called me from you,"?be kissed her, Judas-like, at thememory?"contained news of roy brother's accident. He was killed in a steeplechase, and I only reaohed homo to aee him buried. The houio was in confution, and my father was over- come with grief. What oould I do ?" 

 Bbc had not yet arrived at tho distrustful stage. In love, one believes everything. Yet the vague terror was there still. 

 " But you will toll him, Cyril ?" 

 "Of oourse. It will be tho happiest moment of my lifo"?how barron the hackneyed sentence Bounded!?"when I can take you home with mo. But, for a time, it is best that things rest as they are." 

 She turned her faco to his, and kissed bim. " As you please, dear." 

 "You aee, Carry," he stammerod, " that? that I am entirely dependent on my father, and that, if I should give him oaUBO to quarrel with mo, I might be left penniless. So?so our marriage should be?at least it is best for the present?and?and " (he rushed at the mental fenco)?" we shall not love each other the lesB, 

 shall wo ?" 

 What need for me to write thc answer ? It waa the strongest argument he had used yot, and was effectual, of course. 

 " What am I to toll my mother ?" Bhe asked after a pause. 

 He scarcely know what to answer. " Tell her nothing," said ho. "Oh, Cyril!" 

 " Well, what would you tell her?that I shall be a beggar if my father hears that I have married her daughter? The reason ia a good one, I admit!" and he laughed bittorly. 

 " But abo must know." 

 " Well, tell hor I am not the brothor of the Lieutenant Chatteris you spoke of." 

 " But that would be a lio." 

 Ho looked down upon her crimsoned face. She would not lie for him yet. The acruple struck him aa bo feeble a one that he laughed involuntarily. 

 " You little gooae, did you think I meant it ? Tell har what yon please, my darling. I do not suppose that she can harm us." - 

 Her lissome fingers, white and alender enough, played with the button of hil coat nervously. 

 " You know, abe thought?ahe hoped?that you were well off, and that she could give up keepiag lodgings, and come and live with us." 

 Cyril grew hot with shame and anger. Bid sh* hop* ao indeed! Her hopi* wonk} be fros 

 trated then. And yet it wal natural enough.' He married the girl openly, and the mother, of 

 course, had a olaim on him. But the matter 

 might be "arranged." He had heard of suoh " arrangements." He had laughed, with others of hil class, at the burdens that other men bore. Ho had often given his opinion upon the restraint of marriage, and the possi- bility of some pleasant " arrangement" by which ono could taste the aweet without tbe bitter. At oollego he had been conBidorod rather a " man of tho world "?a cool, calcula- ting, easy-mannered materialist, who snapped sooial ties like withes; and it was his prido to bo considered so. But now tho real, living, actual mother-in-law was beforo him, large and irrepressible. How could ho deal with her? B is wife, too! He loved ber, certainly, but it was a lovo that made him think for a moment that, had she not boon his wife, ho could have loved her moro. Could tho matter bo " ar- 

 ranged ?" He might tako hor away from her mother, and bury hor in Bomo cottage, Bomo villa oVoro, whore birds, flowers, trees, and sun- shine should make up for tho loss of namo and place. Yot when ho lookod at her, ho shuddered at bis own thoughts. Lovo'e torch was burning still, and ho could not hint at a simulated dishonor. 

 " If it was not for tho mother, we could go and livo quietly eomowhero," ho thought, Surely in time ho might get rid of her. At proeent it was simply impossible. 

 Ho rose with a sigh. 

 " Of course she will livo with us, my darling. Wo must ask her, though, to put up with poverty, for I am not rioh, you know." 

 Carry laughed. Sho measured wealth by watoh chains, and rings, and shining boots, and ooata by Poole 

 " You aro rich enough for me, Cyril. We will live as happy as?as-" 

 " As tho prince and princess in tho fairy tales! But I am an enchanted prinoe, you know, con- demned to eecm like a monster in my darling's eyes, because I cannot proclaim hor princess!" 

 Bho laid her head on his breast. Tho aotion touched him, it was so tenderly confident. 

 " God bless you, my darling! I will try and make you happy." 

 And, for tho moment, ho behoved ho ineont it. So the household went on as usual. Mrs Manton, indignant at tho assumption of hor authority, did not appear until breakfast tho next morning; and, when sho did apponr, acted la grande dame with an affectation of distant politeness that made Carry blush and Cyril laugh. 

 He was in bettor humor now. Having got over the first difficulty?tho tolling hiB wifo?ho was prepared to do battle with the mothor-in law. Moreover, in the halcyon days of marriage, ono is apt to look at tho world through roao ku j tinted glass, and to trust to Fortune for a sottle 

 I mont of unpleasant matters. Ho informed I Mrs Manton that ho should tako no stops at jt | present with regard to " moving." 

 I " I must look out for a houso somewhere," ' said he; " and in tho meantime, Carry and I j had better stop hero." 

 Tho Burdon bowed haughtily. 

 I " Look hore, Mrs Manton," Baid he, " don't It j bo annoyed at what I said last night. I had 

 he j just returnod from a long journey, and was I g ed | fatigued and angry." 

 a Tho lady tossed her head.

 " Very well, Mr Ohuttoris. If you apolo- gises, that's onough. Though I must say that, to turn a Lady out of hor own Apartments, wasn't considered manners when I was a gal!" 

 " My dear madam, I never intended any dis- respect, "?how tho word stuck in his throat!? " but you see that?in fuot?that I was tired, and perhaps wrong and baity." 

 " Quite enough, sir! And may I ask whero you and my daughter intend to reside ?" 

 Cyril was getting warm again. 

 " Reside! why, here, of oourse! unless you prefer ua to go elsewhere." 

 How he hoped that sho would say Yea! 

 "Prefer! My preferences are not to be conaulted. I only look to my child's oomfort and happiness. Ob, Mr Cyril, you'll make her a good husband, won't you. She's all that's left 

 to mo now 1" 

 The red face grew redder, and the eyes aeemed about to overflow. How hideously like her daughter the mother looked. 

 " I will do my best, of course. But do be reasonable. You know I am not rich, and must make the boat of thinga for a little time. I have only a small allowance from my father, and depend in a great measure upon my own exortioni. The fact ia, that my father ia given to prejudices, and if hi knew that I had married a pers^? a lady in your daughter's position, he would be very much annoyed, and would probably out off my allowance altogether." 

 " But you're tho eldest son now." 

 "That does not do me any good. Tho prop ?the eit?tho monoys I may have are entirely dopendent on my father's will. If be quarrels with me, I shall get nothing." 

 This was the beBt thing he could have said. Madam Manton waa a woman of the world, Bud abe saw, or thought she saw, tho position of tbioga at a glanos. 

 Cyril was the son of a rich old gentleman, who would " cut him off" with a shilling if he diiobeyod or displeaiod him. In time he would Bucceed to property, and then his wife and mother-in-law would partake of his luxury. But in the meantime the marriage must be " kept dark." She oould watoh ovor ber daughter woll^nough. No fear that any denial of marriage should take plaoe while she kept watch and ward. Cyril, too, muat be humored. If he waa tried beyond his power of endurance, be might tell hia father, and io blight his own and his wife's hopes for ever. She took her cue 

 at once. 

 " My poor boy! Well, you shall not suffer for mo. You havo married my Carry out of love, and you shan't suffer for it. No! not if I works my fingers to the bone!" 

 The sentiment waa excellent, but, as Cyril in- wardly remarked, the grammar waa execrable. 

 "There is no need to do that. I can work for her bb well ai you can. The only thing I wiah ia, that you will keep the fact of our marriage as quiet ai possible." 

 " Rely on me, my dear boy, rely on me." 

 Carry, fearful of the result of the interview, had been weeping silently in another chsmbor. Shs heard the parlor door open, and rsn to 

 meet her mother. 

 " What did he lay, mother t" 

 "Ssy! What ahonld he say? Ugh, yon little fool! Dry your eyei, and go and talk to 

 him."
