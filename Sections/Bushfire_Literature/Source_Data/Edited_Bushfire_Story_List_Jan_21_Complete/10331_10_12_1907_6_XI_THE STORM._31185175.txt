"Everywhere creeks.were drying, and their shallow waters mirrored a deep blue: sky and trees that stood up stark against it.

".For nearly a week now, day.after day, the heat lie d lasted. News of bush fires came from every side,, and in town the thermometer had .already ,;reached, and passed 100 deg. But ipon that Moiday before Walter Hunt's examination a change seemed imminent. All morning there had been a hint of thlrndei' in the air, and the sun struggled behind heavy banks .of -cloud. Thb. atmosphere was steamy and breathless; and the heat v;as more intense than it had been throungh all thestinny days. 'Patricia, . when-by. ..afternoon. thbe change had not fallen. found the rest lessness that possessed her quite un b1ri blee :ain1 set bff reoIlntely into tlihe scrnfiL ; '" The storm will scarcely fall before night now," she reflected, and went on and on, unconscious of.distanceor. fati gue, so deeply in sympathy was she with the outraged Nature all about her. She came after a-while to a gully that she knew, and was surprised to find that she was already. several miles from the Antimacassar House. Previously she had always come 4to this gully by the road, so that the serub she had. just passed through was uinknown country to lier, and slie determined'to return bylthe old way rather than run the risk of losing herself. But she was very weary, after her long walk, and before returning she flunig':J ietrsi dpwn in the shade to rest-whlere peiftly she fell asleep, andrdid ,not wakuvla orfan hour or more. Meanwhile, the terrible oppression never lifted. The sky was heavily over cast, yet no wind blew ; flowers drooped in scrub and garden, sheaonaks waved their tremulous -leaves;- and the gum trees looin l agaitist the ky and.dwaited, the only patient things in thatinanimate life. Away across the ranges a train whistled, and:its.eolo,.fell like a discon solate cry. qion the heavy iii ; cattle moaned, birds twittered and shrieked, and sought their nests in preparation for the coning storm. Then the wind rose. It tore down the road, sweeping with it dust and leaves and twigs in its mad career ; it made the tall gums bend and sway before it, and snapped their little boughs, and hurled them: yards away. The sigh of the sheaoaks rose to a wail before it; and the great trees groaned and creaked as it passed them, leaving destruction in its wake. It came to the gardens, anid lashed the flowers. and bruised them, and sent the green fruit fallingon every side, Tlhunder rumbled, lightnuig flashed across the lills in great white streaks. . Theu, its, work accomn plislhed thoe ;wind diid, and t)ie rain fell in big, uneven drops. To Patricia's gully, shut in by pro tecting hills, but little of this storm had penetrated, and it was not until the rain fell upon her. uiturned face that'the girl awakened. . She seemed.a little dazed nt first; and could not remember how she came to be there. Butin a moment the steadily.falling rain aroused her, and-she hurried up the bridle path to the road. At first she was inclined to be amused at her dilemma, and looked about her foi a- plae of shelter until the, rain should cease. Nothing-presenting itself, she stood -at--the roadside beneath the trees and waited. But the' rain con tinued its heavy downpour, and th're was no lull in the storm to allow her to proceed. She lbegan to feel tired, and her thirin dress clung'.oabunt her uincom fortably.

She-did not laugh in this emer gency, foi thiere were none to see her.

He did-not uinderstarid it, foi all extreme emotions were outtside his comprehension; so he supposed she was just frightened at the storm, as women oftei- were, and he disregarded it in his light way. But it made himt doubly glid thlat he hiad found her, because in a maInner it Was' triumph for him, and he felt his dominac tion. - - Hullo, Miss Patricia, you ont, too ?' he cried gaily.

But soon the exercise revived her, the numb feeling passed.away, and she felt her fuller consciousness returning. Then she laughed--her usual refuge. - Oh !" she said, " that's better. I think I was chilled and cramped with standing in the rain-so long., I scarcely knew what I was doing. But it is a great shaiiu. to take your coat, Mr. Iluint.

The heavy shower had been succeeded by a fine'rain'that lay like: a mist before them ; and out of it the tall dreiclhed gums loomed ghost like in the fading light.: To Patricia the beauty' and grandeur of it all were only a part of the great happiness that pos. sessed her.
