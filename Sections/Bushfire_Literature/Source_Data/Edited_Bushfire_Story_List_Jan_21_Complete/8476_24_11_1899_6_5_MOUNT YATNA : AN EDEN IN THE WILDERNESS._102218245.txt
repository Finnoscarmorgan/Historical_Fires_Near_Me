THE GENII of the VANGUARD. BY F. E. LOCKWOOD. [All Rights Reserved.] CHAPTER V. MOUNT YATNA: AN EDEN IN THE WILDERNESS. "There must be a slip-panel or a gate somewhere about," said Will. "If that blackboy gets home first I suppose some of the station people will soon be out to look for us. On these outlying stations they are always glad to welcome visitors." "Yes," said the Doctor, "even if they are sundowners sometimes !" He was remembering the time when last he arrived at a station after much wandering. Just then a loud cooee sounded to the right of them, and looking round they saw leaping through the trees and over the fence a man of about fifty, who by his bearing they at once recognised as the owner of the place. "Good morning," said he, breathing hard, and ruddy with haste; "when, how, and why did you come out this side of Mount Yatna ? I believe you are the very first travellers who have come that way, and I've been here twenty-five years. I suppose you got off the track. However come along with me; here are the home-station gates." "Thanks, my friend," said Will, as they walked along beside the dray, "by-and-bye we can tell you all about our strange adventures. What sur- prises me now is how we ever man- aged to reach here. We ourselves can't tell you that. To us this place of yours seems an Eden in the wilder- ness." Passing through an iron gate opened for them by a half-caste boy they proceeded up a long straight avenue of shaded trees. English oak and Indian cedar and other trees from many lands grew side by side. The undergrowth was formed of choicest shrubs and plants. In the distance a long, low house appeared, shaded by a deep white verandah. Be- hind it on the slope of the hill, terrace above terrace, rose vineyard and or- chard to the rocky summit of the hill, whence from numerous springs trip- kled down water to irrigate the soil. At the base of the hill a clear pool received the overflow, and reflected some of the largest weeping willows that the travellers had ever seen. This plot was enclosed within a neat white fence, and the tombstones about it made inquiry needless. As the sound of wheels approached the house several station hands came out to take charge of the horses. The many little houses and huts scattered about made the place appear like a small village. "Now," said their host as he led the way to his dwelling, "what am I to call you? My name's Winstan- ley�John Winstanley of Mt. Yatna; my wife and I are always glad of com- pany. I hope you'll make a stay with us for a while." So saying he took them to the family room with its long dining-table and its sofas, its big book-case, and its walls hung with spoils of the chase: wild dogs' brushes and emus' legs, the talons of hawks, and even here and there the skull of a native, with spears, wom- merahs, boomerangs and waddies. On the table was wine, cheese, and biscuits. Soon Mrs. Winstanley came hastening in. She was a motherly woman a little past middle age and she quickly put her guests at ease. "One of the blessings of bush life," said she, "is that people who meet cannot remain strangers long. In a few seconds we got interested in each other. Why ! if the Emperor of all the Russias were to drop in we could make ourselves at home with him." "Yes, indeed," said the Doctor, "and the condescension would be all on your side." 

 "Come, gentlemen," broke in Mr. Winstanley, "have some more wine. It's my own make. To-morrow after you've had a rest I will show you round, if you care to come. Did you bring any newspapers with you?" "None of late date," replied the Doctor; "but I suppose you have your mail sent here?" "Well, yes�that is, it is brought by train to a railway station about two hundred miles from here. Then the mail-coach delivers it at a police. station sixty miles away, and we send a black boy or woman for it about once a month. If the creeks are in flood we are often without news for months. As for stores, my wool has to be carted 200 miles to the railway and we get a load of stores up by the return teams. At first we used to run out, but now we keep a good stock on hand." Next morning, accordingly, Mr. Winstanley showed his visitors round the station. "I grow wheat here and barley," he said. "That windmill grinds more corn than we can use. We make our own wine and vinegar and dry fruit in the sun. Maize grows very well here, and poultry and stock of all kinds thrive. Milk, butter, 

 eggs, pork, bacon, we produce in plenty. It's not very much we need to procure from town. We actually have to waste much of our produce because as the crown owns this land we are not allowed to sell what is grown on it. However, my wool and cattle I can sell and the rest I ex- change with squatters some of whom are forty, some a hundred miles away. In that way we get sugar, tea, rice, medicine, in return for wine, dried fruit, fresh fruit, potatoes, onions. The natives about here have learned to drive bulloclk, and so the barter goes on. I have the advantage over my neighbours that very few possess such land as this. Although the sheep and cattle runs are mostly in blue-bush and salt-bush there's plenty of water and they do well." At dinner six young men sat down to table as well as Mrs. Winstanley and her two daughters, one of whom was a mere child. The other was Elsie, a girl of fifteen, to whom the Doctor was at once attracted. To his surprise and pleasure he found her quite free from that silly bush shy- ness so common in the back-blocks. 

 The explanation came out through Mrs. Winstanley remarking : "We sent Elsie to school in Ade- laide when she was twelve, but last year her health became bad and we brought her back again. Since then by the help of books she is getting on very well and now she teaches her little sister." After dinner, over their wine, the guests inquired of the squatter how he came to choose this far away station in preference to one nearer town. "I'll tell you all about it," he re- plied: "I was a shepherd for a wealthy man. He was a bad master. His chief object in life seemed to be to keep his men under. I was married and had one child. My work was hard; the pay was small. All our rations were measured out to the last grain. I be- lieve that the boss came from Van Dieman's Land, whither he had arrived as a "government emigrant" along with his wife. Originally they came from Scotland. No matter what pains I took with the sheep through drought and lambing time there was no reward either in thanks or increased wages. But my wife and I stuck to it, and in a few years we had saved enough to buy about eighty sheep at half-a-crown a head. The natives about the station meanwhile had become very fond of us because we were kind to their sick. So when they heard we wanted coun- try they told us of this place. I bought a horse and cart, got some stores, and travelled slowly here, picking up odd jobs and buying cattle on the way. A native, whose wife I had doctored, came with us and took charge of the sheep. He's dead now; a splendid chap he was. His body lies in his own land under the gunyahs yonder. I'd have laid him beside my son under these willows, but his tribe wouldn't have it. Then the other natives helped 

 me put up a slab house and make a garden. For a long time we couldn't afford to kill the stock meat, but there was game in plenty. Nothing came amiss to us in those days, wild duck, geese, wallaroo, kangaroo, opossum, and even a native rat kept us going. As for clothes we patched and re- patched. Boots and stookings didn't count for much. The natives made us plenty of skin rugs that came in very useful. Once I remember going to a gunyah to see some blacks who were keeping sheep for us. I got wet through and hung my clothes be- fore the fire when I turned in. In the morning all I could find of my clothes was some buttons, the fire had grown too big during the night. I was seven miles from home, so I wrapped myself in a native rag and trudged home "sans breeks," to the delight of my family. But in spite of such draw- backs those who have toiled hard for their possessions feel a love for them which is beyond the understanding of other men. There is a pride and a pleasure in watching the wilderness become fruitful field because of the work of one's own hands. "I remember when the first rose bloomed in the garden, it was one of a highly-scented variety. One warm morning the perfume blew into our slab hut through the open doorway as I sat with my wife." "O," said she, " I am sure I smell a rose. Come and see my country's flower !" 

 So we went out there was our little two-year-old son dancing round it, clapping his hands. Before we could stop him he had seized the bud and stuffed it into his mouth, and when we got to him the last petal was down his throat !" "Don't you ever wish to live in the city ?" asked the Doctor when the laughter at this little anecdote had drifted away. "Not I. The boys do go there sometimes and mother has been there with Elsie, but among my own things and acquaintances is the place for me. Here is all that I wish for to make life pleasant, therefore why should I go elsewhere?" "You have a good many light- coloured natives about this district," ventured the Doctor in his ignorance. Will gave him a disapproving head- shake, but the old squatter was not disconcerted. "Yes," said he, "That is the sin of this Eden in the wilderness as you called it. I don't know how to help it. There are about forty or fifty half-caste young men, women and children about. We feed and partly clothe them, but they live in a semi-barbaric state. The worst of it is that the native men of the wilder tribes are very partial to girls of mixed race, whilst no white women cares to wed a half-caste youth, so there's a constant "degradation of species" as I suppose your scientific men call it, eh, Doctor? Have you noticed a pretty girl in the kitchen? That's Karobie; though she likes best to be called Annie. She is very clever but rather too knowing, I can tell you. That's her mother over there by the fire, roasting 

 grubs. Her father though you won't believe me, is, (or rather was) a man in holy orders. At least, that's what the natives say. "Well, that's too bad," said both the visitors at once. "And now, Mr. Winstanley," said Will, "we must tell you about our- selves." So long into the night they sat discussing ways and means with their worthy host. The sun was high when they rose next morning, and Winstanley, after breakfast, brought to them the native boy Milmilty, who had news of an old native that had arrived at the station earlier in the morning. Accordingly the party went off to interview him concerning the lay of the land. At first the stranger did not seem very ready to speak. He scratched his head and glinted from his deep-set eyes at the strangers who came to him. Then he mut- tered some gibberish, the tone of which very plainly said he didn't want to be bothered. But Jim Win- stanley, who had accompanied the travellers, know what he had to deal with. Taking a pipe and stick of tobacco from his pocket he handed them to the black. That changed the face of things. Quickly the treasure was lit and, puffing away at it, the native said that no white men had made their fire long in his country. 

 He had seen some and found tracks of others, but that was many moons ago. None had stayed; none were there now. Plenty water in lakes ; no rivers; plenty kangaroo; black man Lowerer (meaning many); plenty good land for sheep. And so the cross- examination went on until Will and the Doctor concluded that away to the north-east was land in which they were to set as the Vanguard for their race. 

 "Now," said Will, " efore we set out for what is called ' o Man's Land' (passing over the aboriginal claim to it) I will write to my wife." "And I," said the Doctor, "will write home to my father. Possibly we shall perish, and it's as well for him to know the end of me." "Oh ! there's little fear of perishing, Doctor," said his companion, "what the Winstanleys have accomplished almost without means to start with surely we can hope for with plenty. Our only fear need be of blacks, of whom I was told by Mr. Winstanley that a large hostile savage tribe had its grounds to northward, and before he and the friendly natives could live in peace everyone of the bad tribe had to be shot off the face of the earth. If such a thing has to be done again we will do it once and for all. Half measures and temporising are no good." "I agree with you," said the Doc- tor. "What has been done once can be done again; if we fail it won't be for want of trying." After a short stay with the hospit- able residents of Mount Yatna the two again set out. The dray was loaded with good things from Mr. Winstan- ley's store, and the master himself accompanied them to the boundary fence of his territory, leaving with them at last his good wishes and many invitations to make use of his friendship. When he had gone, the two travelled on, taking with them the native boy Milmilty, who was to show them the way. There was silence for some time, then the Doctor turned to his companion with� "What a lovely girl Elsie is !" "Well," replied Will indifferently, "I don't think I noticed her much. I was so taken up with the whole settle- ment that I found no time for details. However when I return. I'll take more notice. I fancy though the boss has more grandchildren in the settlement than he knows of." 

 "What of that," returned the Doc- tor," I'm sure nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. And for all that, his sons are free from much worse sins that are com- mon in cities. "There's something in that," Will agreed, "and there's no slavery there among the blacks ; they come and go just as they please." After another silence, during which the Doctor was looking rather low spirited, Will remarked : "Isn't it lovely weather; neither too hot nor too cold. In Australia I'm afraid it's mostly either one or the other. . . . Winstanley tells me that he heard from the natives how, during one of their summer visits to a friendly tribe, they camped beside great lakes full of fish. Around them were rocky shores on which the desert pelicans built their nests. Winstanley says he has often seen these birds fly- ing over Mount Yatna and has won- defed how they came. His belief is that there used to be a great inland sea in the centre, and perhaps these lakes are the remains of it." It was indeed a beautiful day. From the south, always a cool quarter in Australia, came a refreshing breeze across the clear sunny sky of loveliest blue. Thousands of acres of heath country, laid out by Nature's great Gardener himself, with every shade of colour and blending of form swept on ahead of them to the horizon. Spring- ing from the dray the Doctor began gathering specimens. "Why," exclaimed he eagerly, "here's laurestine like that in my father's shrubbery; here's a splendid hibiscus, look at its great flowers; look at the golden broom and the scarlot broom, the orchids and the heather-bells !" "Doctor, Doctor, come on ! Jump up, and never mind the vegetation. Plenty of time for that in the future further on." 

 "Well, I hope we'll settle on a run with a corner in it like this country," responded the Doctor, climbing to his seat again reluctantly. "Of course," said Will, "but give me gold, good water and grass country and I'll promise you all the other advantages." The horses jogged on steadily over the level, open country. The fifth day came. It was mid-day, ever the stillest time in the wild bush. Sit- ting side by side the two friends drifted into a conversation about the earliest of pioneers. Fifty years ago landed on the south coast of Australia a little band far from their native homes. As the ships that brought them put to sea again, spreading out their sails to catch the homeward wind, how those on board must have pitied the scat- tered few among the sand-hills. It seemed then as if they had everything to lose and nothing to gain. Money was useless, the want of food a great dread; they were in an unknown land. What terrors would meet them on their way ? 

 "How their wives and young child- ren must have clung to them," said the doctor. "Well," replied Will, "I've heard that the women were braver than the men in those days. It is said that even highborn ladies who never before had done field-work put their hands to the plough and toiled beside their husbands and their sons and daughters. They helped to build shelters from the sun and rain, and to reap the few sheaves of their first harvests. As for the children they made splendid peace-makers with the blacks. They enjoyed going back to the savage state, and during all the early history of South Australia I never heard of an insult or an unkind- ness to a child from any native. I wish I could say as much for the white settlers; they were guilty of many villanies." At this moment up came Milmilty, galloping furiously. He had been on 

 ahead. "Me see smoke. Black man come along. Me plenty frightened." "Well then, go back to Mr. Win- stanley and tell him there are natives ahead and that you fear to go on with us," said the Doctor. Milmilty needed no second bidding. He set his horse going full speed, and the last they saw of him was his ragged shirt fluttering about his shoulders, in the wind of his flight. "There is smoke under the hills sure enough," said Will. "It's not a bush-fire, so it must be a native encampment. My mind is to go right on and meet them. Their appear- ance will give us a good indication of the country and we might find out about the watershed of the district. But let's be on our guard. Load the two revolvers and have both rifles handy." 

 Mr. Winstanley had given them a fine pair of kangaroo dogs and these were chained to the dray. Now they were loosed, and went bounding on before, then scenting some game they disappeared among the low bushes, returning soon after with their mouths giving evidence of a successful chase." "Whatever we do to secure peace," said Will, "we must not part with our flour. 'Pitch into kangaroo but spare the damper' was the motto of our first pioneers and we must keep to it. Flour was then from �10 to �20 a bag, but it was obtainable at those prices, while here it is not." However, they did not make the hills that night, but pitched their camp in the scrub, not lighting their fire lest marauders might be attracted. Darkness came on. The horses with their hobbles made a pleasant noise in the long grass. The dogs lay stretched to rest beside the red dray covered with its tarpaulin. Nocturnal creatures of earth and air moved about them drowsily. Some of the Mount Yatna wine gave a zest to their supper of salt meat, and they sat for a time discussing their plans. 

 Said Will, "Directly we find per- manent water I propose we settle there. We are now quite 150 miles from Mount Yatna. I can't stand this houseless, homeless life much longer. I know the golden hill is somewhere in the range of the distant mountains we sighted this afternoon. Perhaps gold is scattered in many parts of it, but we must get better acquainted with the spurs and made hills of the locality." "Yes," said the Doctor, "I per- fectly agree with you. But it will be be some time before we dare bring your family up here." The Doctor said this as if he were contemplating a possible family of his own. "Bring them ! No, indeed replied Will, "there's a deal of work to get through before they come. If we see them in two years I shall be satisfied." "Wouldn't it have been our wisest course to have purchased a station all ready to our hands, think you?" "No, I think not. You see it's much better to begin at the beginning. I've never felt much pleasure in second-hand belongings. I've been on many homesteads and never yet found one could admire at all points. We could form an entirely new settle- ment much more to our satisfaction at less cost than the alterations of an old one would mean to us." "As thou sayest so let it be, Atten- borough," chanted the Doctor, "and now let us to sleep. I hope we are not encamped among any of the giant ants we saw to-day ?" "Ah, no, this soil is too damp for them. So now to sleep." The Doctor rolled over on his back. But not to sleep, he was too tired for that. "What's that goes overhead like shadows sweeping by ?" he asked dreamily. "It's the Pokumbidnies," answered the other. "Why, what are they?" "Well, I cannot perfectly explain. The natives would tell you better. Pokumbidnies, they say, are black fellows of great size, the opposites of the Muthroo or little people. Both classes are at enmity with all decent folk and are forever seeking to do them harm. Only the great doctors or sorcerers can cope with them. They pounce on men, women, or children and utterly do away with them if they can catch them alone. Only those in whom is some supernatural gift can rescue their victims. One story re- lates how the Pokumbidnies caught two children and laid them to sleep at the bottom of the Hume or Murray river. Mounkilwanki the spirit of the river did this. But Nurundu came along and being a greater spirit than the other he fished up the two children and restored them to their mother. Nurundu is one of the good spirits, but as the bad spirits have special tracts of country belonging to them they are generally left alone by the good ones, who often laugh at our stupidity in not knowing that the Pokumbidnies have them !" 

 "Surely, Attenborough, you don't believe such nonsense." "To a certain extent I do, and so do many wise men, I can tell you. But enough said for to-night. We are safe from many things the natives have to fear. But we most be cau- tious in our dealings with them. It strikes me we shall have a lot to do with them to-morrow. And now good- night." Next morning they were up betimes. Soon the dray was under way and making for the smoke that still rose from the foot of the hills. After some hours' travelling the hills drew very near, and clumps of timber stood thickly about them. From one of these thickets suddenly broke out a party of armed natives irregularly marching. Fine men they looked. Their bark shields, newly made, were colored white with bands of red. Their hands were full of barbed spears. Their bodies as they drew nearer were seen to drip oil mingled with yellow ochre as they moved along in red and white war-paint. Some tame dingoes ran about them and an old man, who seemed to be their leader, came on ahead. "It's a Pinya or war-party out on some tribal grievance," said Atten- borough, " perhaps after one of their wives or runaway lover. Those are very important pieces of public business with them. All their warfares begin 

 from love. Why, to recount half their romances would be a year's talk. But now, I wonder if they know how to smoke ?" By this the war party had ap- proached and stood still for a short time without speaking. The travel- lers took out their pipes and lit them. After a little yabbering amongst them selves the natives laid down their spears and came forward. "They don't mean mischief to-day," observed Mr. Attenborough. The old man who had seemed to be the leader came forward, and from under his matted hair, thick with grease, he drew out a very black old pipe and held it toward the white men. They filled it for him and lit it, then after it had been solemnly handed round to each of the Pinya, the Doctor took from his pocket a new white pipe and gave it to the old man, who grinned and nodded with pleasure. However, gesticulate as they would, neither the Doctor nor Will could make any sense out of the party, who finally left them without any news of water or good country. The Pinya departed south- ward, the white men pushed on to the hills. 

 "It's a pity," remarked the Doctor, "that such a fine country should be inhabited by such a useless race of men. They still belong to the stone age, but we are pioneers of the twentieth century. What is there common between us ?" "Food," replied Will; "but see, isn't that a lake at the foot of the range before us? Can it be the Lake of Shadows? Let us make for it. See how clearly the hillsides are re- flected in it !" No, it was not the Lake of Shadows. Teal, black duck, spoonbills, native geese, and majestic black swans floated upon it or rippled its waters as they rose or dived for fish. Great gums fringed its broken shores, and the slopes of the hills that rose gently to a height were forested with sandal- wood, mingled in some places with pine and blackwood and tufty sheoak. The place had a look of home about. it. Green rushes grew along the flats and in the shoal water. In the open lay the tall coarse kangaroo grass growing rankly, but Will Attenborough knew that English stock thrived and fattened on such pasture, especially when after being eaten down or swept off by bush-fires a finer and softer growth took its place. "This is the place for us," said both pioneers in a breath. "And now continued the Doctor, "lead on Attenborough. What's to be done first?" "Get out the axes, saws, gimlets, and nails. We will fall some timber and contrive a hut to begin with. When we have all our belongings under shelter one of us can go back to Mr. Winstanley and get him to spare us one of his men and a native as helps." So they drew lots which should go and it fell to Mr. Attenborough. The remainder of that week occupied them with the building of the hut. They never forgot that task. To them it seemed almost like erecting a temple to consecrate their wander- ings. For the first time since Aus- tralia knew man, the sharp iron bit into the timber of that wide wilder- ness, though it was Tubal Cain who wielded the first axe. It was a temple in the rough. The sides of it were slabs and over it for a roof was nailed their tarpaulin. For a door one of their spare blankets was made to serve. Inside the hut on shelves were ranged the provisions, and outside was drawn up the dray, packed with harness and tools. 

 Having completed their arrange- menths, Attenborough set out. "Good- bye" said he, "I'll find Mount Yatna all right and I'll send a man to you at once. There's plenty of water and feed for the horses near by, so they won't wander far. You can't do anything but watch till I return, so keep up your pecker and don't worry." So Will, charged to procure all that he thought fit for their new settle- ment was gone, and the Doctor re- mained alone in the midst of a wilder- ness whose very name he did not know. (To be continued.)
