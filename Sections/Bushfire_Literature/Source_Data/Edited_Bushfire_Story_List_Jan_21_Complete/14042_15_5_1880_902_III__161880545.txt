 From an early hour there was bustle at Mill View. Not: ihat there was much to be doae � the chief thing-, in fact� being merely to make ready the luncheon. But Mary, whose cheerful springy step sounded about the house, tho indication of health and good humour, had the liveliest pleasure in this preparation, and delighted in busying her self to the utmost. As for Fanny, her excitement was unbounded, and had it not been for the careful eye of her friend, Mary, there is no knowing what would have been, stowed away, as the best of ' good cheer, in the capacious maws of the hamper that stoocl yawning on the dining-room table. As it was, finding herself thoughtlessly wrapping up the toast rack in a napkin, she, with an ejaculation of ' Deart dear, how annoying now !' unpacked and repacked nearly everything for fear of having made any other mistakes of r the same kind. This was before Mrs. Wilson and Dr. Field, who were anything but early risers, had shown their faces. For the former, to quote the doctor, had a 'd ? d. dangerous habit of reading some cursed rubbish or another in bed till all hours of the night,' and of course had, as a banker would. Bay, to draw on tho morning drafts which, should have been ho'noured by the night before ; while, as for the doctor, he ? loved the blankets for their own sake. 'When these late ones came down to breakfast they wore ? agreeably surprised to find the hamper packed and stowed away, under Jim's care, in the doctor's buggy, and the ladies' horses� for the doctor, who was going after all, had decided not to ride^ � ready saddled and bridled, and pawing the gravel by the orchard fence to which they were tied. Breakfast over, a start was made � John, with Mrs.. Wileon and the two girls, riding briskly down the road, leaving the buggy to follow with Dr. Field and Jim � the latter now very wrinkled and seamed about the eyes and neck, and possessing a beard which had become the colour of his opossum-skin cap. 'When the riders had reached the sliD-panels admitting them into the paddock at the foot of CJuondong, and had changed their canter to a walk, Mrs. 'Wilson gave a sigh of relief, for she was red in the face and perspiring very much from the unusual exertion. She derived great satisfaction, . ' however, from observing her daughter's figure and deport ment � mentally comparing them with those of her friend Mary, much to the Iatter's disparagement. Fanny, indeed, was a splendid horsewoman ; and, as such, bore away the palm from her smaller, though no less grace ful and lovely companion. John was not regardless of Miss 'Wilson's appearance. As he got off his horse to let down the sup-panels, he glanced admiringly at her well-posed figure and the health ful glow in her face. 'Miss 'Wilson, you appear to have enjoyed your ride.' 'O.ycs! there's nothing I like so much� it's really lovely, you know, isn't it i' I �rald live in the saddle. 'Ma ! how cousin Joe would like to be here now I though he was, Mary, O ! such a dreadfully bad rider ! (laughing.) 

 7u sailors are you know, men he was up on a visit once ITour station be gave all the horses sore backs ? � Good riders sometimes do that, Fanny.' ' YeB I know ; but he was really shocking � but sucn a ?oilr fellow ! von would like him! ' 3 �? If ow my child, why will you run on like that about a ^iptp bov� a scapegrace that absconded from home, and is drowned by this time, or eaten by the Fijians. I assure mi Mr Woodford, quite a lad.' y 'IbeffYOur pardon?' looking up suddenly. 'Pray, excuse my inattention, Mrs. Wilson ;� if s so long since Vve seen Quondong I ? ' Mrs. Wilson bit her lip. Fanny burst out laughing. ?- O Mr. Woodford, you are a cure ! ' Tohn raised his eyebrows ; but soon seemed to take in the �*ne for he smiled coldly, and, turning to Mary, began bribing a chase he had after a dingo, many years ago, �ar the spot by which they were then riding. A few minutes afterwards, as they passed the clump of Whos where he saw his mother stand so pale and statue r w� that memorable night, his brow clouded ; he became ^fit -and as his eyes involuntarily traced the path taken vrt,p wretch, with whom ehe afterwards fled, his jaws *y�F �devoloitly-h'ke a mastiff's. How often he had thought of that night, and of the a mnlation (bat had fallen so suddenly upon him, stretching ?fccold hand out of the darkness, and tightening its still imduring clasp upon his heart. Again and again he had rarecd himself for the part he had played� for the action tiiat had deprived him of the mother that had loved him so WCU and whom he still loved with all the fervour of his . passionate nature. Other thoughts, however, always broke in. Had she not disgraced herself ?� disgraced him and his father? Nay, killed his father, for to her, indirectly, his death was owing r She� she had done this ! � the woman he remembered as so dignified, bo proud, so full of self-respect ! O ! If it could be disproved � if it could be disproved! he often maddened himself by thinking ! If he could refrain even from thinking of it! but, no, the black thought was ever present, throbbing a dreary accompaniment to his every Save at rare intervals, the animal spirits and good humour of his youth were benumbed by these feelings ; and by degrees his pride and passion grew stronger and less under With a less confined and self -involved? life� in contact with a busier community � with more varied duties� it is possible that this thought would gradually have been obliterated from the mind of John Woodford. But, in a neighbourhood like Warrandilla, where even trivial events have more than a passing interest, while those of more moment are long preserved as the groundwork on which the history of the place is woven, John, by many tokens, was, necessarily, made aware that the black mark on his name was not forgotten ; and this served farther to strengthen his memory and increase his reserve, and was ever felt by him as a stinging reproach. Coming to a clear grassy opening at the foot of 'a tall white-gum tree, the place struck him as admirably suited fora camping ground ; and, drawing rein, he called a halt. ' O, ma ! how charming ! ' said Miss Wilson. ' My ! isn't it, Mary ? How green and mossy ! ' ' Lovely ! ' ' How beautiful those hazels look, my dears � so smooth and speckled! and there's a little brook murmuring by them, too.' ?? Creek ! ' ejaculated John. 'Brook is more romantic, sir, and I prefer it. How delightfully still the place is ! Do you know, it reminds me of a scene described by Spen6aw,-~ dear ! dear ! I quite forget the words ! You must know them, Mr. Woodford ? � A diowsy land,' I think the passage begins.' ' Thomson you mean, probably : � 'A pleasing land of drowsy head it was, Of drcam6 that -wave before the half-shut eye ; And of gay castles in the clouds that pass, For ever flushing round a summer sty.'' ' Yes � yes, that's it ! go on ? ' ' O ! do go on, Mr. Woodford ! now, do go on, please ! Well, what a piovoking man you are ! ' ' lleally, Miss Wilson, I don't think I can trust my memory farther. Besides, we must remember the buggy. How is the doctor to find us out, unless I return to guide him ? That is, if the buggy can penetrate so far, which I am rather inclined to doubt.' ' O, yes, John � papa � suppose they should lose their way in the scrub ! ? ' ?? There's no danger of that, Mary ; Jim's a good bush man. Well, good-byefor the present.' Wheeling his horse, he disappeared down the track. For a minute or two they could hear the creaking of his saddle, and the occasional click of his horse's shoes, and all was again still. Dismounting, they tucked up their habits ; and, having tied up their horses, strolled over to the creek, and lingered there, admiring its clear water, and the many varietie3 of ferns that lined its banks. At length, they heard the neighing of their horses, and the switching of the saplings a little way off, wliich told the approach of the buggy, and they returned. . Very soon John made his appearance, with the buggy, containing the doctor and Jim ; and, in an extremely short space of time� for cool bracing air and exercise had given all keen appetites� the hamper was lifted down, a spotless table-clotn was spread upon the grass, and all the good things placed upon it were soon being done ample justice to by everybody, Jim included, who, a respectful distance, in tfie doctor's words, 'wagged away his under jaw like a beggar.' 'Music would be lovely now. Do you like music, Mr. Woodford ? I adore it.' ' Certain kinds. But I'm not an enthusiast. Do you know the verses ? � � Some cry up Haydn, some Mozart. Just as the whim bites ; for my part, I do not care a farthing candle For either of them, or for Handel ! ' ' ' Hp ! he ! he ! how comical ! whose are they ? not your own ? � My ! are they really ? ' 'No; they're Lamb's.' ' Lamb ? O, yes ! we had his Essays at Brekdataart, I remember � Break-the-heart pa* used to call it, you know , we had floods and bush fires so often. Talking about Lamb though� how glad I am to be away from that j-lace, with its mutton� mutton � mutton from week's end to week's end ! It was dreadful ! ' ' When the wine was introduced, John, who had never forgotten his mother's strange words, when she requested him, so impressively, twelve years before, never to touch it, framed some excuse for declining to take any; and, sauntering, glass in hand, to the creek, drank instead some of its cool water. Returning slowly, the repose of the scene, the cool breeze, the mellow sunny_ sky, against which the leaves above him trembled so distinctly, endued him with thoughtful, yet pleasing, feelings. How calm seems everything ! What a distance he can see through the trees to his right! How impenetrable seems the scrub to his left, ' Where careless quiet lies wrapt in eternal silence, far from enemies ! ' He stops now and then, and looks about him in an abstracted manner, listening indolently to the birds. TOa�i *� ?ku?k- ' he hears a %rtl-i Pte6011 'M from tlLe wattle tree he is passing ; ' chuck-uc-chuck !

' a Smoke vm make me the happiest .man j allow^M.^fhf^^fonn his saying 'if you will j videCTe&S^Fvr17' '1-m agreeable, pro- j 6- Wikm �8 Jwt on the point of commencing 'Well, ; 

 in my young days ? ,' but this direct question of Mary's deterred her, and she merely pursed up her mouth, and said, ' Noo, noo � not in the open air.' John came up as she made the remark. ' Jim,' said he, ' I hope you tied up my horse properly ; you knew how easily he takes fright ; and I heard a wal laby rush through the scrub in his direction just now.' ' O, yes, sir ; he's all right.' ' Just go and make sure, will you ? ' 'Doctor!' said Mrs. Wilson, 'who seeminely could not get out of her mind some resemblance she affected to see between John and Lord Mortimer, ' Did jou ever read ' The ChUdren of the Abbey ?'� 'Ye ? es; I believe so� couldn't swear, though. Why?' ' Doesn't this scene remind you of Amanda and Lord Mortimer in the arbour, eating cold lamb and salad?' Dr. Field took the pipe from his mouth, threw back his head, and burst out into a coarse guffaw. ' Well, 'pon my soul!' said he, 'that beats anything I've ever heard ! Hang me, if I don't think the woman will die yet spouting in a garret ! ' What more he said on the subject was drowned in a demoniacal chorus from laughing jackasses, who had noiselessly perched themselves the moment before on the topmost branch of the gum tree beneath which the company were sitting. ' O, those horrid birds ! ' said Fanny, ' they gave me such a fright ! ' then, turning' suddenly to her mother, she cried, ' Ma ! ma ! quick ! shake your dress ; there's a bull ant on your pannier ! ' O ! O .'� O, Mary !� Mr. Woodford ! do take it off ! quick� quick ! O, I 6hall be stung ! I feel him now, quick ! quick ! ' In the midst of the confusion, one of Mary's feet turned under her and gave the ancle a painful wrench. She made light of the accident, however ; and, after a minute or two, suffered little or no inconvenience except a slight swelling around the joint. While all were commiserating with her, Jim returned and informed John that his horse had bolted. 'Boiardo? confound the thing! Did you see him? Could you discover the direction in which he'went ? ' 'Yes, sir; I seen him down there towards Meredith's. I don't think he'll be for going far ; but I aint so spry as I used to be, sir; if ? ' ' Yes, yes, Jim� I'll assist you. Ladies ! you must excuse me for a quarter-of-an hour, or twenty minutes.' 'Towards Meredith's!' he continued, as' he departed in company with Jim. The words seemed to bo suggestive of anything but pleasing thoughts ; for his brows grew dark and lowering, and his jaws assumed that stern squareness which was habitual to them when he was displeased or angered. Jim, observing his master's mood, remained silent, and trudged on a little ahead, every now and then, from habit rather than from any assistance he could derive from the action in so thickly wooded and circumscribed a place, shading his eyes with his hand and peering keenly through the scrub. They passed on thus for some time, until they had left the more open part of the scrub nearly a mile behind them but still they found no trace of the horse. Jim began to think that lie must be at fault, or they would surely have seen him by this time. On coming to an impenetrable mass of tangled and thorny undergrowth, they halted, and decided to keep to the left, which was moie heavily timbered, though the scrub itself was there less dense. The ground in this direction soon grew swampy ; and, in a few minutes, they came upon a shallow sheet of water. Sharp-bladed grass and rushes showed here and there in it in patches ; and through these, and along the glimmering water, some wild ducks, startled at their seclusion being broken in upon, skimmered and then, rising up through the tress, flew awav Rounding the trunk of a tall blue-gum tree, John Woodford and Jim came upon nine or ten crows, which were gorging themselves on the remains of a sheep that had wandered into the swamp, and there died unable to extricate itself. Jim, who, in common with bushmen, had a strong hatred for these ravenous and detestable birds, attacked them with sticks, or whatever else came to hand ; but, although crows are generally very shy, he could not drive them away ; they fluttered heavily about the dead sheep, cawing harshly and dolefully all the time, and again settled on iis torn and bloody carcase. Looking for a better missile with which to attack them, his eye. fell on freshly-made hoof marks, of which the pulpy soil afforded a distinct impression. From the shoeing disclosed by the imprint, and other peculiarities, both John and he were satisfied that the marks were made by Boiardo. Following them up, Jim, by direction of his master, took the lead as the most experienced, and the crows were soon left cawing in the rear. They walked on quickly for about a hundred yards, when the ground became firmer, and the hoof marks consequently less distinct. Jim, however, with his eyes bent on the ground, and heedless of everything else, followed the trail easily, and was certain of soon coming up with the wan derer. He muttered to himself as he went along : ' What's bred in the bone '11 come out in the flesh, they say. By the Lord ! and that's true. There isn't another horse on the station 'd lead us such a ? tramp as this. O, yes, curse you ! don't go straight ahead, go round every tree, do ! S'help me bob ! the beggar wants shooting ! Couldn't stop and crop that grass here. 0, no ! of course not! Old Milligan has been teaching you, has he?' (allud ing to the constant remark of the said old Milligan, the valetudinarian schoolmaster at Warrandilla, that there was nothing like fresh fields). 'Ah, you beggar! you trampled your bridle there, did . you. Curse him, I say ; round every tree� round every stump!�' His muttering was here interrupted by a cry from John, who was 60ine twenty or thirty yards in the rear. Halting suddenly and looking back, Jim saw his master leaning against the trunk of a blackwood tree. He held Eome papers in his clenched hands ; and, as Jim approached he heard him say in hoarse impassioned tone, ' Mother ! thank God, thank God!' ' What's the matter, sir ? ' John, much overcome by his feelings, was unable to answer for a moment or two, and simply pointed to some whitened bones lying at the foot of the tree, and to the papers and a ragged pocket-book, which he held in his hand. Jim glanced down, but started back a little when he saw the bones. ' No blackfellow's, them, I'll take my davy ! by the skull anyway� why� why it's broken! whose is it, sir? have you any ? ' ' ' Whose ? why that scoundrel's that my mother was sup posed to have gone away with ! Here's his pocket-book ? here's his likeness in this lecket � here's a letter in Italian addressed to her, and probably intended to be delivered had he not seen her that night as'he hung about ! The sneak ing, cowardly, villian ! Thank God ! mother ! ? ' ' If I may make so bold, sir � I don't think there's a man on the station, down even to Cranky Dick, the shep herd, as thinks different. There's thorn down there at Sullivan's, � when� when � Joe Warner was sneering like, � blowed if they didn't bundle him out neck and crop, and him with his cheque in his pocket /' ' Jim, you're an honest fellow ! ' shaking him by the hand. ' But how does he come here, sir.' 'Do you see that branch? the bones lie beneath it. Now, the last I saw of him that night, he was riding ewiftly into the scrub in this direction ; and my idea is that, in passing under this tree, he failed to observe that branch in rime, and was swept off his horse and no doubt instantly killed. You see the skull is broken, probably in the concussion with the branch.' ' That's it, sir� that's it, sure enough. And hi6 horse ? �why, so help my never ! ' slapping his thigh, ' Warrigal, of course ! You remember, Warrigal, sir?' the bay mare, with the star on her shoulder, as no one laid any claim to, and was wandering wild in the scrub hero with a saddle on her back for God knows how long ? ' ' Yes, I have a slight ? ' ' Why, of course, sir ! and Boiardo her own son bv the Jumper ! Well, well, there's a knowing one, to bolt* like that, and lead us all the way down here like a Christian ! Lord ! Lord ! and I a cussing him all the time for dodging and curling round them trees like Jack Stokes when he's equifiy. I always said as he was a knowing one. S'help 

 me bob, sir ! I shouldn't wonder if he was to trot right back now he'd done what he wanted. I always said ? ' ' No, no, Jim,' smiling at the comical expression of earnestness on his face, ' we won't wait for him to do that. He can't be far off, though ; I fancy I heard a neigh just now. Do you follow him up and bring him back as soon as you can, and I'll return to the camp.' ' I'll do my best, sir Lord ! Lord ! to think o' that now ! I always said ? ' John returned in a very excitable frame of mind. The. blood tingled in all his veins, and flashed through his brain �lighting up his eyes with an expression of mingled pride and affection, as his thoughts dwelt on the memory of his mother. Where was she ? Did she live ? He fondly hoped so ; nay, felt in his heart that she did. Had she heard of his father's death ? No, no; surely not, or she would not have remained, away. These, and a score of similar thoughts, arose tumultu ously in his mind as he walked along through the silent scrub. As to her probable abode, he could form some con jecture from the papers he had found; and the picture which his imagination, enlivened by the fondest regard, conjured up of the future, endued him with the liveliest pleasure. To find his mother, to hold her up to the esteem of the world, to surround her with every enjoyment, would now be the chief aim of his life. What money had he at command? Not, indeed, as much as he could wish, but ample surely for his purpose, notwithstanding two bad seasons on his station on the Murray, and the gradual frittering away of Quondong by the selectors. He would set out for Italy at once � in a month at the latest ; he would find her, and bring her back in triumph ! As these thoughts coursed through his mind, he walked along in the most buoyant spirits, holding his head proudly erect, while his pale face beamed with pleasure. During his absence the girls and Mrs. Wilson had not been idle. Having packed the knives and forks and other appurtenances of their repast, they left the doctor asleep, and, going out in a body into the scrub by the creek, came back with armfuls of flowers, which they were assorting and forming into nosegays when John returned. Their merry chat soon awoke the doctor; who, after rubbing his eyes, pulled out his watch, and said, 'What! an hourl I haven't been asleep all that time surely ! What the dickens are you giggling at ? Where's John?' ' Here I am, sir.' ' Well, you're a pretty fellow ! D'ye call this a quarter of-an-hour?' ' Boiardo had wandered farther than we thought ? ' ' Ah ! Mr. Woodford ! your's is a dressmaker's quarter of-an-hour ! So like Miss Magers, Miss Field. � Do you know, I always go next day when she says quarterofan hour, he, he, 'he ! By the way, though,' in a more confi dential tone, ' She has certainly spoiled my List dress ; Fanny pointed out to me this morning ? ' 'And where's Jim?' Baid the doctor. 'You don't mean to say you didn't bring the horse back with you ? Not found yet? Well, all I can say is that you express dis appointment in as remarkable a fashion as would Foote, the actor, or whoever it was, were he in your place.' 'How, papa?' ' O, he once undertook, before some friends, to express any emotion by the mere play of his features ; but, some how, his face would convey 'to the onlookers the opposite impression. ' What is that, gentlemen?' said he, pursing his mouth and turning up the whites of his eyes, ' A� a� sarcasm, perhaps,' they thought. ' Sarcasm ! � agony � agony ! can't you see ? ' ' What's that, now ? ' looking at the point at his nose, and leering. *,O, that's idiocy; and very well expressed it is, too.' ' Idiocy ! Idiocy ! Heaven and earth ! Idiocy ! why, ? you I that's love ! ' Haw haw ! haw ! ' ' Well, the fact is, doctor, my feelings at present are very pleasing ones. Will you step this waya moment ?' and, drawing him aside, he* told him of the discovery he hod made*, and showed him the papers and the pocket book. The doctor congratulated him warmly, said he was very glad the ? thing was cleared up, and that it would give him the greatest pleasure in the world to hold an inquest on the remains. He said, moreover, that it would be as well to say nothing at present to the women about the matter � thoBe Wilsons were such clapper- jaws. Curse him! if he knew what possessed Mary to invite 'em � Jackasses ! As for the old woman, 'pon his conscience he believed she was demented. Wanting him to climb a tree at his time of life ! Gad! what next? &c. &c. ' Here, John, lad ! you must take a tumbler of wine be fore we return.' ' No ; thank you. I � I � the fact is, I never touch it ! ' ' ' What ! come, come, you must to-day at any rate. Gad ! when I was your age ? ' 'No; I'd rather ? ' 'D� it! lad, you're not turned milksop, surely ! What harm is there in a glass of wine, or ten for the matter of that ? You're not one of those Mutual Improvement hum bugs � tea and tracts.' ' O, well, pour it out � pour it out.' The doctor accordingly poured out two tumblers of wine ; one of which he handed to John, who took it from him in a nervous, hesitating manner, but gulped it down almost instantly. Yet, short as was the time between his raising the glass to his lips and his lowering it empty, he heard during the interval every word of the speech his mother uttered twelve years before. The whole scene rose up distinctly before him, there was his father ; there his mother; there were the bewildered and staring faces of the children ; while her words seemed to reach his ear in whispers, like the wind soughing through the trees,�' It has been de ruin� alas, de vorse dan ruin of moBt of my familee, and it sail not be gifen do him ! Shon ! Shon ! you must nevair touch it! ' He stood silent and pale for a moment, with the empty glass in his hand, and appeared to listen as though he actually heard his mother speaking. ' It has been de ruin � It has been de ruin � It has been de ruin!' throbbed in at his ear, along with the rustling of the leaves, as though from a distance. 'Well, 'pon my conscience! for a young man that requires pressing, you emptied your glass with remarkable celerity. Try another.' Another was poured out. He drank it mechanically. They now made preparations for departure; but, as Mary's ancle was still painful, and prevented her from riding, and as the doctor did not want to drive� having a lively recollection of the branches whisking in his face as they caught in the dashboard � there was much debating as to who should ride and who should drive. It was eventu ally decided, much to Miss Wilson's chagrin, the buggy seating only two, that John and Mary should drive � starting off at once, as they would have to make a dctow ; and that the others should wait Jim's arrival with Boiardo, who could carry the doctor ; while, for Jim's convenience, the side-saddle was to be removed from Mary's horse, Nugget, and the rug substituted. John assisted Mary into the buggy, and then got in him self. His manner had changed considerably within the last few minutes, and now seemed marked by disquiet, and even moroseness. ' Good-bye ! ' came in chorus from Miss Wilson and her mother. ' Good-bye ! ' ' Mr. Woodford ! I'll bet you a penny we're home before you.' He gave no reply. ' Mr. Woodfcod ! I'm shocked at your inattention! I'll bet you ? ' . Slash ! SlaEh ! sounded on the astonished back of old Bes&y, and they were off with a jerk, and soon lost to view behind the saplings. ' Well, upon my word ! ' ejaculated Mrs. Wilson. ' O, 'ma ! how could he hear you, and the horses neigh ing !' 'Gad! that's Jim's cooee !' said the doctor, after about twenty minutes, They all listened. Yes: there was no mistaking it � ' Coo-ee! ' came again softly on the breeze, accompanied by the whinney of a horse. At this sound, Miss Wilson's charger, and that of her mother, pricked up their ears, neighing shrilly ; and the doctor, curving his htinds around his mouth, came out quite unexpectedly with a long-drawn and piercing ' Coooooo ee! ' 0 .'�0 !� ,' gasped Mrs. Wilson, pressing her hand to 

 her heart. ' 0 ! doctor, you gave me such a fright ! I declare you ve given me quite � quite a pal� palpitation of the heart ! ' ' Palpitation of the grandmother ! ' muttered the doctor. ' Affected old humbug ! on a station half her life, and pre tends not to know the custom of the bush ! ' Then aloud, and with a Machiavelian smile, ' Palpitation ! Gad ! I'm very 6orry, m'am � it's the complaint of these colonies, heart disease, unfortunately � only soother, change of scene � freEh fields� ahem!� sea voyage; or that sort of thing. Between ourselves, I ihinV there's something in the� ah � air here prejudicial� yes, 'pon my word ! There's old Milligan, the schoolmaster, he's troubled that way; but I thoughtlessly alarm you� I�!�' ' O, no, not at all ; but do you really ? ' 'O, ma! he's joking! I declare, doctor, you're incor rigible ; you deserve a good pinching ! ' ''Pon my conscience!� no� haw! haw! haw! ha! ha ! ha !� O', no : quite true, believe me. Hallo ! here's Jim at last ! Well, sir. youv'e caught the wan derer?' ?*. w -s ' Ye� es, sir.' This was said in a drawling melancholy tone, quite the reverse of Jim's usual cheery manner, and immediately attracted the doctor's attention. ' What's the matter ? Knocked up ? ' ' Knocked up ? no, sir � that is, yes sir, a trifle just.' ' Take a drink, man� take a drink� and stop whining, I hate it ; it reminds me so much of the time when I was surgeon to a lodge of Druids ; the members of which used to come to me every night in droves to sham on the sick list, curse 'em ! Keening all the time like old women at a wake, � Ach ! the sight of 'em made my mouth taste of copper for hours after. You'll find beer in that bottle.' ? ' I never saw anything like this,' ' he continued. ' ' Here's Woodford comes back without the horse, yet beaming like a bridegroom ; and here's his man with the horse, yet as woe begone and disconsolate as a half -hanged dog.' ' Shall I � am I to ride Misb Mary's horse, sir ? I see the saddle is off.' 'Yes, they've taken it with them,' 6aid the doctor, pinching his little red nose in a thoughtful professional manner. ' That rug will do for a makeshift. Fix it on as best you can, and ride to Quondong, where you can either stay, or procure a saddle and fetch the horse to Mill View. Tell Mrs. Williams, at the same time, that Mr. Woodford said he would sleep there to-night, and to put a fire in the breakfast parlour, as he will have Borne writing to do. Now, are you ?women ready? By jingo! yes, for a wonder.' The Bun was declining rapidly behind the distant ranges, and the brightness of day assuming a dusky hue, as Dr. Field, with Mrs. Wilson and Fanny rode home through tho Bcrub, leaving Jim strapping the rug on the back of Nug get. For some little distance their course lay in the track of the buggy ; which, in Mrs. Wilson's opinion, had been driven with more boldness than discretion � ' to judge, at least,' said she, 'from the torn appearance of the bark hanging from those honeysuckles, and from the manner in. which the horse had swerved through, instead of rounding: that clump of hazel saplings.' This remark calling forth no response, all rode on in silence, the various sounds attendant upon the approach of evening in the bush� the chirruping of countless numbers of small birds, the soft lowing of cattle, the chir-r-r-r of crickets, with the occasional bark of a dog, the clang of a bullock bell, and, at di6tant intervals, the melancholy note of the mopoke� enduing each rider with a tone of feeling little disposing to conversation. Though all felt the pensive influence of the hour, the thoughts of each were very different. Dr. Field was saying in his mind�' Yes ; the fellow likes her� there's no doubt of it. A good, pretty girl ! � and he's a fine handsome fellow, too, by ? ! Proud and passionate though, like his mother� appears to give in to one, but has his own 'way in the end. Queer fish! d ? queer ! How he drew off when he saw the match would please me � the scamp ! loving her madly all the time, I'll be bound. What are his intentions about this mother of his, I wonder? Where the deuce can she be? Loose lot, I'm afraid ; yet, I don't know ; I rather think not; � no. Fine woman, though� devilish fine woman ! ' O ! ' thought Fanny, ' how perfectly delightful� charm- ing � to wander through the moonlight here with hi� ! I could do so for ever ! ' 'What are the words?' murmured her mother � ' 'I know each lane '�lane � lane, what a vulgar word ! That must be wrong. * I know each lane, and every alley green, Dingle, or bushy dell, of this wild wood, And every bosky bourn from side to side.' From side to side ! How badly expressed ! 0, Milton ! Milton ! � is it Milton, I wonder?' ' Two bad seasons,' continued tho doctor. ' in that part of the country are no joke. Suppose a third; but that's impossible. Higgins is a good, steady � steady ? � well, I don't know about steady ; he did drink � (get up!) Wood ford ought certainly to take a trip up ; no one's been near him the best part of the season ? ' 'Get up, sir!' continued he aloud; 'what the devil are you shying at ? ' '0, doctor! Ma! what's that?' ' What's what?' ' Don't you see ?� there, on that bush. Ma ! look you ! ' ' Ye� es ; it's like^ � like a bonnet. Well, I declare ! stay, child, my whip has a crook to it ;' and, stooping, she raised from the bush what proved to be a lady's hat trimmed tastefully with amber and violet silk, but much crushed. ' Why ! ' cried Fanny, aghast, ' if s� it's ? ' ' My God ! ' ejaculated the doctor, snatching the hat oat out of her hand, and looking at it closely, ' What does this mean ? it's Maiy's ! ' Mrs. Wilson and Fanny were too surprised to do anything but look alternately on him and the hat, and then on one another. What could it mean? what had happened ? With an oath, the doctor cantered off down the track, and the ladies followed. The gloom of night had now fallen on the scrub. But the moon had risen ; and, as it shone out of a cloudless sky, pale with its lustre and with J^at of couatless numbers of stars, and gleamed down through the branches and the more open places, the anxious eye of the doctor informed him that the buggy had been been driven with great reck lessness. No detour whatever had been made ; and parts almost impassable even to their horses had been driven through with evident fury ! Had the horse bolted ? old Bessy bolt ! ' Impossible,' he thought, knowing how difficult it was to induce her to break even into a trot. The doctor gave vent to Ms excited and anxious feelings by lashing his horse into a quicker pace. No word was spoken during the remainder of the ride, except his fretful 'this way! this way!' as, at an intricate part of the track, the ladies seemed doubtful how best to follow him. They reached Mill View shortly afterwards. The buggy had arrived safely. Mary was in her room ; ehe load retired the doctor was informed, unwell. He passed quickly into the house to seek ker. ' Harry !' called Mrs. Wilson to the ostler, ' what noise is that?' ' That's Bessy, mum, in the 6table� lying down ablow ing like oldNagle's bellows, mum � I ? ' ' Mr. Woodford must have driven heir very hard, surely,' said Fanny. 'My word! yes, miss. And to see her now all torn and bleeding with them hazels, and lathered with sweat� I wouldn't a' thought master John would a done it � begging your pardon, miss� it makes me sick to look at her, that is does.' ' Shameful ! where is Mr. Woodford?' *' I think he's gone over to Quondong, mum ; he never said nothing to nobody ; you must have nearly a-met him as you come up the road.' Dr. Field did not show himself again that evening, After having seen bis daughter, and conversed with her. he went to his own room ; and Fanny, who was herself unable to sleep, her imagination being excited by the events of the day, and by thoughts of an early departure for Melbourne called forth by some vague remarks of her mother, heard him moving about all night, and occasionally muttering in tones of suppressed passion.
