 BEDOURIE THE HALF-CASTE. 

 CHAPTER XII.�Bedourie on the Trail. 

 By BULLOO. Author of "Gurramon," "The Windandra," 

 When Bedourie left his friends it was with the intention of camping on the Sweetwater Creek, and, baying picked up Boko's tracks to ascertain the direction be was going, returning 

 r* his companions, toe whole party then joining in the pursuit. x Sweetwater was retched in due time, tod �fter a good night's rest the toout ran their tracks baak until be oame to the place where the savages had divided. In a few minute* his practised ejes had caught up the trail and he was speeding along in Boko's wake. The scout hurried along with long sjreeping strides, never swerving from ffae trail until be was abreast of the fa'l?, when, knowing instinctive ly its position, be branched oft'- to the left to rejoin his mates. Arriving at the falls after dark, and rinding the oanp empty, Bedoarfc made* a baric toroli, and in a few rainmes discovered that a stiuggfc bad taken pace in~whisb the whites had been beaten, but he was relieved that they had been taken away instead of brine killed. As he could do nothing in the dark, And* a torch might lead to his being spearad, Bedotnie ; camped in a wretoiied state of mind, unable to determine what his next course should b�, until he had read the tale th& tracks'wbuld disclose in the morning. " At the faintest sign of dawu.Uedourie roae, thd having made his mopning meal picked up 'he tracks, shortly discovering that only one white had taken part in the struggle, the boot marks identifying Sampsor. as the unfortunate. Hoping to find the lads had escaped, the scout eagerly ran the tracks, only to ascertain that they also bad been made prisoners. There was abundant evidence that the- sailor bad made desperate resistance, and Bedourie had no 4oubt the old man had reoeived severe injuries. The lads on the other hand had clearly been am bushed and captured with little trouble. Why the whites had been taken away instead of being killed was a question he could not imagine an answer to, and soon gave it up .in despair. Another question of far more importance to him then arose in his niind. Ought, ite to follow his friendiusr the abdnetors of Roae Watson? "Ought I to try and release them and obtain their assistance to detest Rakv," thought he, " or should I go straight after the latter? Can I telease Miss Rosie if I overtake Boko ? I might follow the boys lot a day or two and find they have been killed and ray time would have been wasted." Finally he decided to endeavour to release the whites, and striking across country cut Boko's tracks. There was so difficulty in following the signs, and he did so at a fast walk, nntflig where Sampson had oaused frequent halts, and shrewdly divining the reason without knowing the author. * ' Towards midday he observed a heavy body of smoke coming towards biro, and hoped it would not interfere with his tracking, but he.. was soon undeceived, and shortly realised that it would be only by good fortune that he could follow the tracks. As the bush fire had spread in all directions it was evident he-woold jOMr h*ve to retreat 01 provide fot his safety ra tone other manner. His uiind was soon made of, and lighting a .fallen branoh with the dea4Tleaves attached^ in a few rnitratefc had a !tn* of fire haW a mile long Mazing formidably. Long before the blacks' fire had reached the spot where he had lighted the opposition con flagration, Bedduri was perfectly safe from its attacks, and stood ort burnt ground wiping frjtfm . his eyes the tears oaused by the pungent smote..: But little of the afternoon remained for the : scout to piok up the tracks, and by sundown he bad realised the hopelessness of the task. He naturally tried to recover them in a straight line from where he had last seen them, but the cunning of the blaoks had been too successful, and ho was baffled. Hour after hour Bedourie ciroled round in the vain endeavour, and finally camped for the night, satisfying hunger with a bandicoot which had been half roasted by the bush fire before he killed it. An hour before daylight the scoot had started from his lonely camp to cut Boko's tracks, which he felt sure must be to the west, and, half mad with rage and disgust at the loss of time, Bedourie would have made short work of Boko had they met. * Thirty miles must have been covered when the scoot found signs of Boko and hi 3 parly. The blaoks had camped at a tiny spring m the hills, and the young half-caste was delighted to discover the imprint of Boss Watson's little heel in the damp earth. The impression was so narked that Bedoorie had no doubt the girl had done it purposely in the faint hope of being rescued. Had Rose's track not been found the scout would have been in doubt as to whether she was with that band after all, and whether the blaoks bad not practised the samo rase which had proved so successful on a former occasion. The tracks were not very fresh, but Bedourie's eyes were keen, and he had no doubt as to being able to follow them, the only thought that troubled his mind being whether he could overtake the marauders before they arrived at Tarcoola's camp. With long, gliding strides, and weapons ready for use, the human bloodhound hurried on, animated with but one thought, that of Rose Watson's rescue or vengeance upon her murderers. Bedourie was conscious that he might walk into an ambnsh, but the risk could not be avoided, and he kept as keen a look out as compatible with following the tracks. Had there been two, one could have tracked while the other scanned the timber and bushes'. * More than once a kangaroo breaking cover caused the half caste to raise his rifle sharply, fortunately keeping him on the alert, for with out the slightest'warning two spears whistled by him and a nulla glanoed off his shoulder. Quick as a flash Bedourie slipped behind a tree and awaited developements. The blacks. 

 a� usual, had no intention of exposing them- i selves to Bedourie'* fire, and kept as sileat as- j the coout. This position might have been | maintained until nightfall, but time was a great object with Bedourie, and he determined to force matters to an issue. -1 Although grass was scanty, there were a \\ number of bushes growing about, and vthe scoot, lying flat on fue ground, wormed his way along, keeping the tree and some bushes > between him and the cover where he thought the blacks lay hidden. He thought his enemies could not be numerous, as tbe mUtiilcfl thrown were so few. The idef Jben entered Bedourie's head to sneak right away and continue on the trail, But remembering that he would be in peril both in front and rear, be de . tenuined toiight bid nearest foeu. l | When the scout had crawled about a hundred yards away he assumed a serai-erect attitude, i working round so fts to get to the id" of the ; blacks who had attacked him. To such a ' perfect bushman it was no trouble 1b locate the ezftot spot, and in half an hoar he was olose to where he had been surprised. Moving with oat-like' steps <?he scout, with crouched body, and rifle at the roady, caught night of a ' black standing erect by a tr^e. "There must I be at let?t two more," he thought as he looked < . keenly around. I A faint rtfstling attracted his attention, and he discovered Iwo blaekfellows perched -in the sbAdy branches of � spreading box tree. Tbe ?turn were no unsuspioieas of danger, and were �o completely at hit mere/ th*at Bedourie . smiled grimly as he took steady aim at one of those in the trse. Crack!�and one blaokfcUow fell, clutching at tbe branches, while before his startled com panion had time to gtir a ballet bored its way through his back into his heart. Like a flash ? a third shot was discharged at the black by the ' tree, but he had sprung away, and the bullet grased his neck, the shock bringing him to the (pound. " That's three of tbe dogs anyhow," muttered the scout as he proceeded to reload, his riflt. 411 wonder if I know any of 'em." % The two who had fallen from the. tree were quite dead, and the half-caste failed to recog ; nfafe either. The third man, however, had been barely stunned, and an Bedourie stooped to turn him over on to his baok a desperate lunge Vas made at his heart, and the next instant a pair of tough arms were around him. \\ The blackfellow had dropped his wooden knife when he made bis futile attempt . upon the scout's life, �nd aa tbe . *iie had kmn knocked ont of Be . fowie's haad the Jeeyj?troggled so lax wpon even terms. HUT Bedourie not been taken quite unawares the probability is that the fight would have been short, but the black had got first hold, and hoisting the half-caste off his feet flung him on the ground. But Be dourie grasped his opponent by the legs in v time to prevent him regaining his knife, and once more the foes were looked together, this time on the ground. Bedourie was the more powerful, but the black, almost maddened with .^rror," was temporarily the stronger, and grasping Bedourie's throat with his left hand wound his other arm and legs around him. The position was desperate in the extreme, and Bedourie realised he was in danger of losing his life, but jerk and twist as he would he could i not weaken his enemy's grasp. With choking ; gasps h* endeavoured to throw tbe black off i bis chest, or to get his hands free, bat it seemed in vain, and he found himself, growing weaker. Jnst then his elbow struck against what he recognised to be tbe black's wooden knife, and twisting hi? hand underneath he grasped it. With a supreme effort he rolled over, getting the black underneath. The latter, however, Maintained his deadly grasp of the scout's throat, but Bedourie was on top now, and . drawing his knees into the black's stomach he . caused.him to lower bis legs. It was only for a second, but that was sufficient, for freeing his right arm Bedourie raised the wooden knife and plunged it into the eavaae's heart. With swollen neck and parched throat the scout raised himself, and while gazing at his dead enemy muttered: �' Well, it's all right this time, but I guess I'm a jolly fool. The nex* nig' that gets me on the" hop I'll forgive him. I was a fool and no gammon." In a few minutes Bedourie had picked up his rifle and was hastening on Boko's track as if nothing had happened. The latter, doubtless, had with his accustomed ounning arranged the ambush from which the scoot had so luckily escaped. Bedourie did not anticipate falling into another trap for some distance, and broke into a ran where the track was sufficiently defined, hoping to find himself within easy reach of I Boas Watson by the evening. But the half-caste had not given Boko . sufficient credit for ounning and persistency, and was once more taken unawares. Beckoning that Bedourie would be less careful on the plains than in the timber if he escaped the ambush, Boko bad instructed seven of his smartest men to choose a favourable place in a piece of open country they were crossing while he pushed on with the white girl. With a eigh of pleasure Bedourie left the timber and strode rapidly along the trail, con gratulating himself upon having left country so favourable to an' ambush. Tbe plain extended for some miles, broken here and there by belts of timber lining the banks of small creeks. Far away to the south the horizon was bounded by a range of ragged, pioturesque hills, some of them being of a reddish colour, while pthers were tinged with purple, often resembling ruined fortifications or monasteries, the whole forming a most striking landscape. But the scenery had no attraction for the scout, all he hoped wap that the band would not split in two, and that he oonld enter the hills before dark. In more than one plaoe on the tracks low bushes of blue willow grew profusely, and in one of these clumps were hidden three of Boko's men, while still nearer to the approach ing half-caste, but off the track and a little on one side, w*re planted the other four. Boko's instructions were carried out to the letter, and a perfeot trap awaited the scout. Bedourie had passed the line of the first men's hiding plaoe?, and had nearly reached the plant of the remaining three ,when he 

 caught tight of � dingo which,, peering eound ft bush, shrank baclE as .if in fear of � blow. The 1000! needed no farther warning, but bounding to the left ran at his highest speed. Wit li loud yells of disappointed rage the blacks sprang up and hurled a shower of spears nfier the flying man, a light one taking cfleot in his ripht calf. Without stopping Bedourie ran on for abcut two hundred yards, when, looking laoTc and finding himgelf well out of reach of I'u parsuers' weapons, he sat down, and breaking the spear head off draw the remainder out of the wouod. He had no means of binding up the woutia even if he bad bad time, &o riling he sped onward again as a spear, hurled from a throwing-stiok, went with a snick into the I ground olose by. ' " It's best I run in the right direotion," thought Bedouvie; " I'll be nearer Miss Rosie, anyhow. But what about these skunks behind?. I think i I better settle with them first time. s I mnst , frighten them off or kill them somehow." I ' (To be continued.)
