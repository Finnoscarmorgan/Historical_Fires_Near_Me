 CHAPTER XVI. 

 The Cruise of the Terror. 

 ** Scarce the foul hurricane was clear'd; 

 Scarce wind and rain had ceased to rattle When a bold enemy appeared, 

 And, dauntless, we prepared for battle." 

 -Dibiin. 

 Every town in the Australian colonies had been roused to boiling indignation when the frightful news of the treacherous Shipwreck of the City of Brisbane, and the Tile massacre of her human freight became known. 

 Immediately the first intelligence of the disaster reached Brisbane, the gunboat Terror, being ready for sea, was at once dispatched to Bluff Lighthouse, with orders to trace, pursue, and capture the villain ous escapees, who had caused this great public calamity; and Captain Brace, nothing loth, hardly gave her engineers time to get the steam up, before he had the anchor weighed, and started the Terror on her cruise. He longed to bring these vile brutes to justice* and his feelings were not only shared by his crew, but by every honest man in Queensland. The excitement in every town and village had never been equalled; vessels were sent out from all the Northern Ports, manned by volunteers who awoxe to lynch the pirates if captured. 

 Teasels of war were despatched from Melbourne and Sydney, to search every island in the southern sea. The gunboat Terror was, however, the first at sea, and with full steam up, forged along at the rate of fourteen knots per hour. On her arrival at Bluff Cape, Captain Brace was delighted to find in Reginald and Harold Graham, two old chums of his schoolboy days. He willingly consented to take the young squatters, with their friend Bob Wilson and the blackboy Jumbo, as volunteers; Mike Flannagan also accompanied them for the purpose of identifying the escapees, should they be fortunate enough to capture them. Three stout sailors were landed to take charge of the lighthouse. The Terror then again steamed off in pursuit of the pirate schooner Bevenge/and her crew of miscreants. 

 And now, again every town in Queensland is dism ayed by sad intelligence. A full month has elapsed. Dreadful weather has been experienced off the coast, and vessel after vessel arrive in the various ports, having suffered severely. An immense amount of wreckage has been seen near the Barrier Beef, portions of which have been recognised as belong ing to the Terror. A large steamer, the Valparaiso, from Batavia, is overdue, and the greatest anxiety prevails amongst the friends and relatives of those on the missing vessels. Bluff old Captain Baxter, of the brig Foam, then at Maryborough, determined to go in search of the Terror; and if possible find out what her real fate had been, with the faint hope that her crew might have escaped, and yet be rescue^ from some rock or island. Baxter had no relative on board that vessel, but Ben Brace, her gallant captain, if he lived, would one day become his son, and already he loved him as'his own flesh and blood. 'J Both his daughter and his wife had encouraged the captain in his resolve, and expressed theirr determination to accompany him. Sweet Mary Baxter, the oaptain's daughter, utterly refused, to believe that her lover Ben Brace had perished. 

 The Foam barely, waited to get rid of her cargo, and take in water and provisions, when she again put to sea. News of Captain Baxter's intention had Been wired all over the colony, and although most people believed it a wild goose chaise, ail 

 wished him success. 

 Meanwhile, poor Florence Butler's cup of misery was full; the fatal news had nearly killed her, and the Wilsons were also filled with grief at the loss of their own son and brother, as .well as that of the two Grahams. Poor Kate and Florence shed bitter tears of sympathy in, each tthers. arms. Daily Joe rode to the lighthouse and. sought for news from some .passing steamer, and when the mailboat brought tidings that the Foam was expected off the Blpff the following day, both he and Florence resolved to accompany the vetosel if Captain Baxter would.permit them. 

 On being;signalled* the,Foam lay-to off the Bluff for the boat that-pulled outi towards them, and on 

 hearing their story Captain Baxter willingly con sented to take them on board. 

 But all this: time the Terror had been diligently prosecuting her search. For'-, tunately, when her coal was almost. expended* 

 she had fallen in with the steamer Valparaiso' going south. The latter had had a terribly rough parage, her boats had all been carried away, and she was completely dismasted. However, She had an abundance of coal in her bankers, and each vessel was enabled to do the other a good turn* Captain Brace took on board a plentiful supply of coal, and in return gave the skipper of the Valparaiso two of his life-boats and. Borne spare spars. Shortly after this meeting, a frightful storm came onf and it was a most fortunate occurrence that the Terror bad now a 

 good supply of coal, as she was compelled to lay heaved-to for two days with full steam up; every thing movable swept from her decks, and even her guns lashed and re-lashed to prevent their breaking 

 away. 

 The unlucky Valparaiso, strained and buffeted: by her previous rough encounter with the elements, her bulwarks washed away, meets with a crowning disaster; the shaft of her propeller is broken, and, helplessly driven before the gale, she becomes a total wreck on the Barrier Beef, where most of her crew and passengers perish. The few survivors are rescued by the Terror a few days after, dinging;ï¿½to the shattered life-boat, in a terrible state of exhaustion. It is a pitiful, heart-rending story they tell of the wreck, and how the two boats lent by the Terror-were both stove before they could get clear of - the ship. 

 The reader will now understand why it was that on the wreckage of the Valparaiso and the two damaged boats of the Terror being seen it was thought that both vessels must have succumbed to the fury of the storm. It was also well-known that the Terror, if still above water, must be getting short of coal, and when wdek after week passed and she did not put in an appearance at any port'along the coast, uncertainty became conviction that she and the Valparaiso were both hopelessly lost. 

 All unaware of this anxiety on f their account* Captain Brace and Reginald walkedthe quarter-deck 

 of the Terror in earnest conversation. Their vessel was now returning slowly to Brisbane for a further supply of coal, as she was: again running short. They had searched round half the islands - of Polynesia, and now on their return voyage they had steamed a few hundred miles out of their direct course to visit one of the most unfrequented groups. 

 Bob Wilson and Reggie were playing chess in the cabin, Jumbo and Mike were forward' relating marvellous tales of the land, and listening to still more miraculous yarns of the ocean. 

 " It is a great pity we are running short olF coal," . said Captain Brace, " I don't know of any more likely spot to find what we are in search of. The islands out this way are quite out of the ordinary course of vessels, and some of them are infested with the most blood-thirsty savages; even the labor vessels generally give them a wide berth;" 

 " What a lovely island this is we are passing now," said Reggie; " see how the setting sun lights up the brilliant green grasses between those waving palms; it looks like a fairy land. One can hardly credit it is inhabited by such monsters of cruelty." 

 "This is Tammo; it is the only island in the group that is a bit civilised. I've heard my old fatber-in-law that is to be (old Captain Baxter, of the Foam), say that the Tammo men are the most trustworthy of any in the Southern Seas, though they have a sultry time of it to hold their own with the savages around. them. Lobo, some twenty-five miles south, is a still more lovely island, but quite inaccessible tp any vessel or beat, except the surf canoes of the natives, who are as big a nest of incarnate cannibal fiends as you could find anywhere, except, of course New Caledonia. They are fit associates for the recidivistes of France. But look, Reggie, there's a bush fire surely round that point P" 

 " No, Ben, that's no bush fire, any bushman can tell you that; the grass is too green to burn, and the smoke too black for grass. Here, Jumbo, what you think P" j 

 " Baal that grass; too many fire sit down ; all a same humpy, methinkit. By golly, you see some body carry black handkercher long a stick ?" said 

 Jumbo. 

 Both the young men looked, and the captain clapping the glass to his eye, had hardly done so, than he. rushed like a madmanto the wheelhouse on 

 the hurricane deck, and telegraphed the engineer to fire up and put the boat full 'steam ahead ae^eoon as possible. 

 " What's the matter ?" called Reggie. 

 "Don't you see the black flag; it's the mast of some vessel peeping rover the point,-she ;ia> making out of the bay. Those villains must havecapturea some other - vessel, that mast is too high for a schooner; anyhow that's our piratical Frenchmen 

 without a doubt."
