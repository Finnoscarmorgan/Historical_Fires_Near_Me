 Chapter VI. 

 THE BUSH FIRE. 

 About three o'clock next day Mr. Taylor liad his horses harnessed to his buggy, and started back to Mompa. The distance was about thirty miles, and with a smart team of horses it was easily covered by sunset. Having arrived there he went into the house, and after tea sat moodily thinking. This liad been his first visit to Willowary, for he had not been living in the district long, and lie had come back rather enamored of Miss Nelson* and was resolved to renew his acquaintance with her at the earliest oppor tunity. His thoughts naturally for some time were fixed in this channel, and then reflecting that time, that mighty agent which heals all wounds and cures all plaints, would alone solve this question for. him, he rose and turned for solace to the bushman's 

 friend, his pipe. He strolled over to his overseer's quarters, and questioned him as to the progress of affairs during his absence. He learned that nothing of importance had occurred; that the shearers were still apparently determined to hold their own against him, but that they had not in any way committed a breach of the peace, nor anything that would warrant interference 

 with them. 

 Knowing that it was customary for the men to have speeches from the most promi nent of their number, Mr. Taylor made up his mind to go over and if possible to listen unseen. It was only about a mile to where the camp was situated, and he was soon there. He had but just arrived as one of the men mounted an old packing-case, which served as a rostrum, and commenced to speak. The listener was in an excellent position for hearing unseen, being secreted behind a clump of dense broom-bush, and he listened, while in a rough, crude speech, yet in a measure full of rugged eloquence, an old shearer, grey of hair and beard, adjured his fellows to stand firm, yet in all things to adopt the tone of peace. " Don't let your feelings run away with you, lads; you may be tempted sorely to commit a breach of order, but remember that such a thing once done will do an everlasting injury to our cause and our chances. Bind yourselves together in a strong, well-knit band, stick to each other, and success must in the end be ours. But above all tilings be temperate in what you say or do. One never knows but there might be a traitor in our camp, seeking for some slip of tongue or hand, some thoughtless word or deed, so he might inform. Don't give him a chance, lads. If 

 there is such a crawler here show liim that we can be true men and true unionists." 

 Another speaker followed, and he, too, counselled peace. " Let us show," said he, " that we can control ourselves. There is a talk of others coming to fill our places at squatters' wages. These are our greatest enemies. If they would only recognise that we are working for them as well as for ourselves, that our cause is their cause, we should have little fear as to the result of the strike. The reduction in the prices that the squatters are asking for now is only a fore runner of what they will ask for if they gain the day. They would like to have us working for tucker only, and we must try our level best to win against all odds." 

 Another spoke in the same strain, and for nearly an hour the listener stood and heard the leaders thus discoursing to their fol lowers, and counselling peaceful, quiet, and judicious measures. 

 Presently the meeting dispersed, and the men prepared to turn in for the night, and Mr. Taylor turned to go. About two hun dred yards from the camp he stood still to light his pipe. He was 011 the summit of a slight incline, and from where he was stand ing he could see 011 the one hand the camp lie had just left, several fires blazing brightly, 

 having been heaped together for the night' 

 and on the other side could be seen the few 

 lights of the homestead, Mompa, the distance making them appear like tiny twinkling 

 flashes set in the darkness surrounding then" 

 It was a beautiful night, a quiet breeze blowing, while underfoot the grass lay in a thick mat of nature's weaving, dried by the sun, and in a fit and ready state for confla gration. After gazing for some time on the scene around him, with a sudden exclama tion of restlessness he struck a match and 

 applied it to his pipe, then threw the match to the ground, where it at once ignited the grass at his feet. His first impulse was to put his foot on the tiny flame and stamp it out, but something indefinable restrained that action, and he stood and watched how the little blaze gained strength, how it spread little by little till it seemed to have got a thorough hold. Then some evil im pulse whispered to him that it would be well to let this fire spread, and that he could afterwards manage to throw the blame or suspicion upon the men who were camped near. Hie evil suggestion came in a moment, and was acted upon at once. Turn ing about he set oft for the station just as the spreading flame got sufficient hold to attract the attention of those in the shearers' camp. He heard a shout of surprise from there, and putting 011 all speed he fled from the place, nor halted till he had arrived at 

 the homestead. 

 At the camp all wes excitement in a few minutes. There was no lime for conjecture as to the cause of the fire, but without a moment's hesitation the whole camp moved with but one impulse and one thought to try and quench the flames, which by now had gained a strong hold and were spreading 

 with fierce rapidity to right and left, talking in their sjrasp all that lay about them, running up great trees like some destroying serpent, and folding in a deadly embrace the trunks of all that stood in its way, fanned by the breeze that now lijd strengthened and was adding zest to the devouring element. In the face of the fast advancing flames these shearers stood, and with an energy and will worthy of any cause they strove with all the power that puny human frames can wield to stay the progress of the fiery giant. Useless toil, yet pursued with ardor undaunted and persis tence unchecked. With a measure, too, of valor there they stood fighting, battling against terrible odds�for whom? Self? No; for the sake of that man who, like a spy, had crept into their camp and listened lest perchance he might hear aught of threats or violence, he who even now stands at the front of his house and watches how the flames are gaining, how the fire fiend grows and swells. Is there a spark of manliness in him ? No ! Like a pitiless cur he stands and whines that these men are combined to ruin him, that they are striving to burn him out of house and home, and soon others who are standing around, persuaded that the man is speaking truth, are ready to condemn unheard the men who, careless of any danger, are fighting hard to save this man's property. Their bravery, their self-sacrificing toil, is purposely mis construed, and it is said that they are trying to divert suspicion from themselves by empty efforts to subdue the flames. 

 Presently all those who had been standing around Mr. Taylor have gone to lend their assistance against the fire, and he stands there alone, doubtless deep in thought. Suddenly he is roused from his reverie by a touch on the shoulder, and he turns to see standing at his side old Myers, an aborigi nal. An eccentric personage this same Myers, and to-night he looks an uncanny object. Just returned from a kangaroo hunt, with all the implements of the chase and but little clothing, lie looked an extra 

 ordinary object. 

 " Good night, Massa Taylor," he said, m tones touched with the quaint blackfellow English so hard to reproduce on paper. 

 " Hallo, Myers, where did you come from so suddenly V asked the squatter. 

 " Oh," replied the monarch of the bush, " mine bin walk about look out kangaroo, and now mine big feller hungry. You gib it rations, mine want it tucker good many." 

 "Oh, get out, you rascal," replied the amiable squatter. "You are everlastingly looking for rations, and yet when I want you to do a little work for me I can never find you. Clear out, I say." 

 �'Wont you gib it some tucker, boss? 

 the darkie asked in tones of eloquent plead 

 ing. 

 " No," was the firm reply. 

 " All right, Massa Taylor. Some day you be sorry. Supposin' mine yabber which way that fire jump up." 

 14 Which fire do you mean 'r asked our worthy friend. 

 " That one longa shearers' camp,- replied Myers. , . 

 " What do you mean, you thundering black rascal Did you see the shearers set alight to the scrub ?" queried Mr. Taylor. 

 " No," replied Myers. " Baal mine see it shearers. Only another fellow, mine bin big feller tired, you know, and mine bin pull away longa station and bin go by shearers' camp, and bin hear 'ein yabber yabber, 

 good many." 

 " Yes ; and what did you see, Myers ? 

 " I bin look out and see white fellow sit down longa scrub. Bye and bye he bin git up to walk about, and me bin git close up, and see which one that fellow. Me know 

 him, my word. I say, boss, you gib it 

 tucker ?" 

 "Yes, yes, directly. What else did you see?" asked Mr. Taylor, anxious to hear exactly how much Myers really knew. 

 " Oh ! White fellow light him pipe�I say, boss, you gib it bacca ?' 

 " Yes. "Damn you, yes." 

 " Then," continued Myers, " he bin throw it firestick longa grass, andbimeby fire jump up�good many�and white fellow he bin pull away like itdebbil longa station. _ I bin come too. I sav, boss, which way rations ? 

 Mr. Taylor shouted to the cook, and told him to give the black some food, and he, well loaded, went away satisfied and chuck ling, leaving the squatter a prey to some very unpleasant thoughts and reflections. 

 He could see plainly enough that he had gone too far ; it would be folly for him to attempt a prosecution for incendiaiism against the shearers, for it would lie next to impossible to keep the old black quiet, and it pained him sorely to think that when he had almost completed his project for revenge an aboriginal should step in and thwart his plan. He walked to a place whence he could see the progress of the fire, and noted how the strenuous t/fforts of the beaterB had turned the course of the flames, till the homestead was no longer in jeopardy, for the fire was now confined to a heavily scrubbed paddock, and if the wind did not freshen again the fire would soon exhaust itself. 

 Ere long the overseer, who had gone out with all the available hands to check the 

 fire, returned, and he spoke with warmth of the grand stubbornness and will which had characterised the work of the shearers in the struggle. Said he, " No man on earth can make me believe that those men 

 were guilty of wilfully starting that fire. My opinion of those men is higher than I ever thought it possible to be, and I advise you, sir, to take advantage of the opportu nity and let them start shearing on the old terms. I am sure you would never regret it�they are a grand lot of men." 

 Something evidently of a reproach must have struck Mr. Taylor, for he stood silent for a while, and then speaking slowly and deliberately said, "Yes, Jones, perhaps it would be as well. I will leave things in your hands." 

 So ended another dispute, and in a few days shearing at Mompa was in full swing.
