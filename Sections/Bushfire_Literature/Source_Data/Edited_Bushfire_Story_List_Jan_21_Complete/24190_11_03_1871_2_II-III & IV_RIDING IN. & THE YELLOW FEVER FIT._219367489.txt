 VOLUME II. CHAPTER III. � RIDING IN. 

 It was evident from the very first that Miss Lucy Herbert had taken something more than an ordinary fancy to Mr. Charles Ashton. Bright keen blue eyes, regular features, and a tall well- knit figure, had evidently much to do with the 

 preference manifested, but the brother's liking for the young guest was to the sister, perhaps the strongest attraction. From the first day of his arrival at the station Mr. Ashton was at once established as a friend. There was much in the easy, careless grace of his manner-� that evidently of a man trained in good society� to attract any one, and to John Herbert, a gentleman born and bred, it was specially at- tractive. Situated on a thickly wooded flat, the windows of the wooden house where the brother and sister had made their home, looked out upon a swamp where in the downpour of the rainy sea- son the water lay deep and turbid, divided off by the declines of the ground into little channels, and forming into tiny waterfalls over nature- felled logs. In the hot summer, when the north wind blew fiercely from over the ranges to the rear of the house, the swamp was a half baked-over expanse of barren, tree-bestrewn ground, with occasional soft spots in which a horse-hoof sunk dangerously . In those scorching hours, too, when even the shade of the tall gum trees was barely sufficient to keep out the glare, the herbage underneath grew parched and-withered, and in the thick forests around the bush fires blazed ominously. But in the days when Charles Ashton first shared a squatter's home there was none of this. The sirocco of plain and forest was sleeping rain- stilled in his winter home, and the water-sprite held sway over all. There was not much to do in the way of out-door amusement, for the scarcely ceasing rain and the cold blast of the south made the fireside welcome. But by that fireside, in the dark moonless nights, when the rain plashed down into the swamp, and the mimic waves rolled up against the garden fence, the three friends passed many a pleasant evening over the glowing logs. It was but a rude weatherboard house after all, but in every nook and corner the gentle sway of woman's taste ruled supreme. The window of the room given to the master's shipmate had no brighter look out than over the far-spreading swamp, from the midst of which the gum-trees reared their height loftily. In the dead night, too, when fires and lights were extinguished, the long doleful whistle of the curlew, and the plash- ing of the rain-drops on the gum leaves, formed rather a melancholy chorus. But in the room itself, when the dark influence of the night was shut out, or when a visiting 

 gleam of sunshine poured in its radiance during the day, the signs of a woman's presence were clearly manifested. Such flowers as garden and season gave bloomed in vases, books and drawings were on the table, snowy curtains hung around the bed, the gentle influence of the bright spirit that ruled the house breathed out in every corner. And in the little sitting room, from the win- dows of which Lucy Herbert could look out on the garden her brother had so carefully fenced in for her, what merry evenings were passed there. Evenings when, in a low sweet voice, the English girl sang ballad after ballad of the old knightly school, that no rage for Italian music will ever put out of fashion among the lovers of the true home music that never wearies. Evenings when brother or friend read aloud while the sister worked, or when, if both were tired after a day with the birds on the swamp, the low soft voice told gently some tale of old romance or poetry. It was a happy time indeed. A time of rest from toil and struggle. Day after day, week after week, passed away, and still, while the rain poured down unceasingly, and men, heavy-booted, swag-laden, gold-seeking, toiled on through mud and mire towards the great altar of Mammon, Charles Ashton remained at the station dreaming his time away. Within thirty miles of where he sat listening to music, or watching white fingers as they lingered over a doubtful move of king or castle, the pulse of the gold-fever throbbed fiercely. Up and down the road that wended through the bush, within a few hours' ride of the station, rode Captain Barrington with his escort day after 

 day. Gold enough to build up a pyramid of for- tunes was carried down in carts, driven recklessly through sludge and swamp, with a cracking of whips, and a clattering of sabres. Not so very far from the room in which the young adventurer slept at night, men gently born and nurtured toiled all day wet and weary, knee- deep in clay and water, and lay down to rest hand-sore and aching, but still hoping on to the last that one strike the pick might lay open the Nieberlunge of the south. High on the throne that the nations had made for him sat the monarch of the mines, waving his yellow sceptre over the land, and beneath his sway bent every head, with a hope of his royal favour throbbing every heart. Had Charles Ashton mounted one of the sta- tion horses placed at his disposal by his host, and ridden but a few miles from the garden where grew the flowers culled for his dressing-table, he would have seen many a strange sight indeed. Along the road on which John Herbert's sheep were driven to market, men walked, rode, and camped, in one ever-hurrying, never-thinning crowd. Some waxed faint and weary by the way some turned aside here and there in disappoint- ment ; but still, without a pause, the main body of the gold-seeking army rolled steadily on towards the gilded fortress of a possible fortune. Humours of bushrangers floated throughout the district. Tales of men tied to trees and mal- treated, of publichouses robbed in the night, of pursuing police galloping hotly along highways and byways, were rife everywhere ; but still the tide rolled on. And, in spite of all, Charles Ashton tarred at Lal Lal. Whatever might have been his motive in coming to the country, whatever might have been his greed for gold, whatever future he might have wished to carve out, seemed alike forgotten, and he tarried on in the house looking on the swamp, happy and at rest. Honest, merry-hearted John Herbert, never flagging in spirit or body after the hardest ride or the longest walk, had taken a strangely strong liking to his occasionally moody guest. " What is the good of your going to the diggings?" he would say, as they sat smoking their pipes over the fire after dinner, while Lucy was away superintending the preparation of tea. "You have no idea what a beast of a life it is. Besides, after all, it is only a lottery, just fancy a wet tent on a night like this, and no gold in prospect. I tell you, whatever newspapers may say, that that's often the case, and there's many a poor devil on Ballaarat now who will never see wealth, or even comfort again. No, Charley" � it was Charley and John now with the young men � " you take my advice. Stop here, and pick up 

 what I can show you, and you'll find something better than digging." And Charles Ashton did stop, day after day, and never thought of digging ; and day after day, too, Lucy Herbert's eyes filled with a soft light that had never dwelt in the blue depths before. Between brother and sister the affection was beautiful to see ; but, after some little time, it would have been evident to a clear-sighted observer that the sisterly love was quite able to include both brother and friend. " We mustn't let him go, Lucy," John would say, when they were alone. " Poor fellow, I think there is something more than we think for behind his laugh. I hope he doesn't think we are tired of him. I wouldn't have that for the world; would you, Lucy ?'' And Lucy would blush and smile� the blush more apparent than the smile. The something behind the laugh was exactly what most attracted her to the stranger ; but she wouldn't have let " dear John" see it for the world. And honest, merry John Herbert never dreamed of anything except that he had found a friend he liked, and that his orphan sister liked him too. Far away in the English churchyard lay the two who had made a love match, and loved on to the end. Sister and brother were love-united in the land they had made their home ; what mattered it if a friend could be found to share their happi- ness ? Would it not enhance it ? It is doubtful whether, in those happy days, John Herbert ever thought of such a thing as love between his sister and the man he had brought to his house. He liked him himself, and he was glad his sister seemed to share in the feeling. That was all. But, even had he thought of such a chance, it would have brought no sorrow to his unselfish spirit. He believed Charles Ashton, though poor and unfriended, to be his equal in birth and breeding. He thought him possessed of such qualities as a gentleman should possess ; and had Lucy's fancy led her that way, he would have given up station and fortune to work as a laborer in the bush, sooner than see her thwarted. And what thought Lucy Herbert ? At first, it would have been hard to guess. But, after some time, as the guest s visit was prolonged, it was strange to see how, when he entered the room, she seemed half afraid to look up, and how, when his hand met hers in the arrangement of the chess-men, the colour came and went in her cheek. Very foolish, indeed, if she did feel anything more than a general interest in an agreeable 

 visitor. For what did she know of the stranger beyond the very little her brother had told her? Perhaps it was the something behind the laugh. Perhaps it was the light blue eye lighting up at the slightest contradiction, but always bent kindly upon her. Perhaps it was the tall, easily-swaying; figure, sitting lightly in the saddle, as the horse cantered away among the gum-trees. Perhaps it was the lonely, unfriended lot ; for, post after post, no letters came to the stranger beyond two evidently business communications from Mel- bourne. Perhaps it was one or all of these causes combined. But, whatever might have been the reason, a lady visitor would soon have found out that Miss Herbert, of Lal Lal, was beginning to regard Mr. Charles Ashton, of Adventurina, with something more than ordinary interest. And what thought Charles Ashton? Very little, except that, after a tough, hard fight with a sorrow he kept carefully to himself, he was anchored in a haven of rest and peace, where neither adverse wind nor hostile shot troubled him. Now and then, in the midst even of a merry talk, or when listening to Lucy's music, a cloud would steal over his brow, dark and trouble- laden, telling a tale of some past sorrow not to be easily forgotten. But, under the influence of the gentle spirit of his hostess, it passed away even as Saul's dark mood when David touched his harp, and the javelin of memory fell harmless , to the ground. It seemed as if, a wanderer on the " barren foam," he had cast anchor in a pleasant haven where dwelt a kind fairy from beneath the shelter of whose wand he did not care to stray. Within the harbour the water was calm and un- ruffled : why tempt the waves that fretted beyond the reef ? * * * * 

 He grew a favourite with the men, too. A good seat on a horse, a frank manner, and a genial temper work wonders with a bushman. " Flash Sam" not by any means a bad fellow in his way, when kept aloof from the township, and on duty as Miss Lucy's groom, declared by several colonial deities that Mr. Ashton was as good a hand through timber as he had seen. An old man, grey-headed, foul-mouthed, and old aggish in every way, who had charge of an out-station hut close under the mountain, was of opinion that the gent who had once or twice stopped to smoke a pipe with him, was as civil-spoken a "something" as he had ever met. The old Irish woman who helped in the rough work of the house, and whose son, a butcher on the diggings, had once been soundly thrashed by John Herbert for drunken insolence, vowed that Mr. Ashton was " a jintleman, every inch of him." And a little girl who waited specially upon Lucy was of outspoken opinion that his " 'air curled lovely." Even Mrs. Grantley, who stopped two nights at the station on her way to Ballaarat, where her husband had been appointed a gold commissioner, pronounced Mr. Ashton to be an extremely gentlemanly young man, with a decidedly aristocratic manner. " It was right to be careful, of course, in these days, when all sorts of people came out ; but, still, ' dear John' always was careful, and as Mr. Ashton had come out with him, there could be no doubt about his being a fit person to know." Altogether, Mrs. Grantley, the remains of a fine woman of the exuberant school, paid considerable attention to the young stranger, gratifying John Herbert and amusing the recipient. 

 The frank-hearted master of Lal Lal was quite satisfied about his friend's respectability ; but the additional proof of Mrs. Grantley's approval was not without its value. * * * Thus three months passed on, till at last, in the month of October, when the wavelets of the swamp no longer plashed against the garden fence, and the sun's rays were drying up the water, John Herbert rode into Ballaarat on the un- romantic errand of selling sheep. The sun went down redly among the gum trees that evening, and as Lucy and her brother's guest walked up and down the verandah, fell almost fiercely upon a semi-open glade, down which two horsemen were riding in towards the station. " Your brother John, Miss Herbert," said Mr. Ashton. "Yes; but who is that with him; surely I know the horse. Yes, it's 'Roderick,' the grey John wanted to buy in town. It must be Captain Barrington. Shall we stroll on and meet them? You ought to know Captain Barrington, Mr. Ashton ; he is very nice and clever." " Certainly" said Mr. Ashton ; " I will get my hat." But, for some reason or other, he did not come back, and while Lucy was greeting her brother and the new arrival, Sam handed a letter to the former, saying that Mr. Ashton had saddled his brown horse (one he had insisted on buying from Herbert) and ridden away. With a muttered exclamation of annoyance, strangely interrupting the captain's polite saluta- tion to the young lady, the squatter opened the letter read� " Dear John,�We are friends enough now to stand on no ceremony. There are reasons whys I cannot meet Captain Barrington, and so I have ridden into Ballaarat. I have plenty of money, as I had a remittance from town the other day, and when I am settled I will let yon know my address. Many thanks, old fellow, for your kindness; and with kindest remembrances to Miss Herbert, Believe me, yours sincerely and gratefully, " Charles Ashton." When they entered the sitting-room, John Herbert quietly told his sister and the captain that his other guest, Mr. Ashton, had been un- expectedly called away to BaIlaarat, and would probably be away a week. "It seems that l am never to see this Mr. Ashton. Pity, too, we shall have a gun less to- morrow," was the captain's careless remark; and then he turned towards Lucy with a softer look in his eyes than generally dwelt there. But into those eyes not raised to his there came a sudden sadness, and John Herbert, meeting their glance for one short second, began to think vaguely that Mr. Ashton's visit might not turn out so fortunately as he expected. * * And on the to Ballaarat the brown horse was spurred fiercely, his rider muttering between his teeth : "The old smile, the face that will come between me and rest, and yet sometimes strangely like his sister's that I cannot kate it." " CHAPTER IV.� THE YELLOW FEVER FIT. Early morning indeed. The sun rising over thickly-timbered ranges, and shining down with its first red rays on heaps of earth nearly as red. Heaps piled up here, there, and everywhere. Sometimes red, sometimes a dull date, sometimes 

 a glassy white. Still heaps. Some high, sorne low, but still heaps. And among the heaps, holes. Holes to the right, to the left, and all around. into the ranges, holes in valleys, holes by the side of muddy creeks. All holes, diversified by the heaps. Round holes, oblong holes, oval holes, all sorts of holes. Holes twenty, thirty, forty, seventy eighty feet deep. Holes with small poles stuck up on each side with a round roller fixed between and a rope pendent therefrom. Holes with nothing at all near except the heaps and small pools of water. Holes half filled with this same water, dirty, thick, unpleasant to look upon. And among the holes and heaps, white tents brown tents, and occasionally red tents, dotted here and there without the slightest order or regu- larity. Tents on the sides of gullies, tents in val- leys, tents on hilltops, tents all round, nothing but tents, with a few, very few huts. Through the midst of some of these winding roads, rutty roads, roads anathematised by many more besides Yankee Bill, roads where carts and drays come to inextricable grief, and men swear loudly. The domains of Mammon these, the diggings of Ballaarat. Seen from one of these roads, grouped on the top of a slight eminence semi-surrounded by a creek, more tents ranged in order with a long low, log-building and a smaller building of larger logs. The Government Camp this, the stables and the lock-up. Signs of civilisation and order. The lancet to let blood for the fever fit that burned so fiercely down below. From this group of tents a trumpet blares shrilly ; horses neigh, men come sleepily out of tents and draw up in line, the hoarse word of command rings out, and then a long string of horses are ridden and led to the water, to be brought back, cleaned, rubbed, and hissed over. 

 Simultaneously with the trumpet-call are heard other noises among the holes, tents and heaps. Men came out from these too. Men dressed in all sorts of coarse and soiled apparel, long beards, red shirts, blue shirts, brown shirts, corderoy trousers, moleskin trousers, old cloth trousers, but all, shirts and trousers alike, stained and spotted with the offcomings of those red, white, or slatecoloured heaps. Knives worn ostentatiously in red sashes, and here and there a pistol-butt peeping out. Rolled-up sleeves, bared chests, brawny arms, booted legs all set in motion towards the heaps and holes. Then from this out till sunset, work. Work among the tents grouped on the hill, parade drill, riding out with despatches, courts held, licenses issued, the work of civilization and red tape. Work among the holes and heaps. Hard, plod- ding, weary, wet, and often wasted work. Work done with wild, eager hearts, and by blistered and fevered hands. Work pursued steadily, with no faltering or flagging, with a fair forward-looking purpose. Work sending many a man to a sick bed and a grave, but still work never flinched from or deserted. Heaps piled up higher and higher, holes sunk deeper and deeper, garments stained dirtier and dirtier, hands blistered sorer and sorer, brows wet with the sweat of toil, limbs aching with bending and stooping, eyes dazzled with the mingled glare of sun and pipeclay, and yet no slackening. A hasty mid-day meal, rattle of buckets let down by ropes. Thud of pick, and grating of shovel, rollocking of cradles and splashing of water down by the creeks, men wetter, dirtier, and more tired than ever, and yet working on. Holes bottomed and deserted with a curse, others bottomed and worked out with joy and hope. Men descending on chance into deserted claims, knocking down " stuff" hap- hazard and coming up pale and breathless to tell the expectant mate of the suddenly discovered wealth that had baffled others. Then sunset. Men plodding home, some despondent, some merry, but all so tired, so wet; and so dirty, that the comparative adjective could not possibly be used. Then fires blazing and blows of axe. More work still. Meals to be cooked, pots of water to be boiled, tea to be made, more work. Work even before one can refresh after the toil of the day. Voices heard in tents, holes and heaps deserted. Barking of dogs everywhere; rude scraps of song, and then a dropping fire of gun and pistol. Next eating and drinking, more singing here and there, and soon quiet and sleep. The sleep of men who sleep only that they may renew toil. The lucid interval of the fever fit. Not all quiet though. Stealthy footsteps near a tent, the barking of a dog, a quickly fired shot, an oath, the sound of one man hurrying away, the grumbling of others too lazy to follow him. For there are men who amid all the work- ing of others keep idle , by day to do their work by night. For these men the group of tents on the hill, for these the sabres and carbines sharpened and loaded, for these the preparation among the tents of gun and pistol, for these plunder and immunity for a space, and then the log-house on the hill, the irons, or the gallows. Good if that log-house were used for nothing else Then late revellers returning home and stum- bling over tent ropes with muttered curses. Later revellers with faster tendencies indulging in melodious howls till requests to "jam their tails" ring out from all the tents about. The moon riding high in the heavens now. The tramp of horses, the clatter of sabres, men cloaked and armed riding along the toad � the night patrol passing on to the group of tents on the hill. Perfect quiet now for some hours. Then the chat- tering of the magpies, the cawing of the crows, the red sun coming out over the hills, the blare of the trumpets, the ringing of axes all over again, and the work never ceasing, even as on the day before.
