CHAPTER XIV. 

 Curlew, with the two other busttrang-ers, | returned by a circaitous ronte to their cave in die mountains, sadly depressed in spirits, knowing'that their position was more pre carious than previously. In all probability the troopers would sooner or later discover 

 their retreat. 

 Lighting a fire, the billy was watched by one of them, while the others were in search of a fat wallaby, to satisfy tbem for sapper. 

 The sun had sunk, when the hunters xe turned, with a supply of game, which was immediately dressed for the cuisine 

 * We must look for some bread,' Curlew said,' have you made a search ?' 

 ' There is flour, for a few days,' Ben re plied; 'as to tea and sugar, we have 

 enough.' 

 The men enjoyed the supper, not having eaten anything' all day. 

 ' My word,' Huntingdon said, ' this has Veen a fearful day for us. I wonder where Douglass and Warren have gone.' 

 * i fancy iJmy have cleared for Melbourne.' Curlew said; ' they are well known on tViiw road, and a large reward is out for them, 

 and their friends cannot be trusted.' 

 ' ' I guess it -will be risky for ub after this,' 

 Ben said. 

 * We can't remain here always, that's cer tain,' Huntingdon said. ' The Sydney side Trill be my dart.' 

 The night passed -without incident, and the following morningjCurlew saddled his horse, 

 to proceed to the Hanging Hock. 

 Bora Bora was not there, but Eowani said that he would shortly return. Curlew re mained chatting with the lubra, who had not forgotten her intention of speedily re joining her tribe. 

 ' Ball me like um camp,' she said; 4 ball me yabba long warringo, plenty big moon.' 

 ' You soon yan away ?' Curlew said, ' by um by.' 

 'Plenty yan up bill 'bout 'ere,' she said. ' Ball me yarraman.' 

 They were talking long enough to allow Curlew to have several smokes ; when, with out the slightest disturbance of the shrubbery 

 fronting the cave, or the lightest sound, 

 Bora Bora appeared before them. 

 ' Me plenty patter, Master Rudolph,' he said; ' you yan 'long me ?' - 

 �What do you mean, Bora Bora,' Curlew said; 'you found money?' 

 'Ouay! Master Budolph,' he said,'me track 'em whitefeller when you bin long way.' 

 41 thought you would,* Curlew said. ' To-morrow you show me long away track.' 

 Bora Bora told all he knew about the troopers, and the fight behind the boulder rocks; also, that he saw Curlew; and. which was more interesting to Curlew, that Doug lass and Warren had gone towards .Gig 

 bourne. 

 Curlew listened to all the black said, and did. Then saying that he would be with them to-morrow, he rode away in the direc tion of bis own quarters. 

 Ben and his mate had made things comfort able ; the cave was swept clean, and an in viting- evening-meal prepared. 

 A cheerful feeling banished that of depres 

 sion. 

 Curlew told them that which he had heard 

 of Douglass and-Warren, and said he might 

 hare more news to-morrow. 

 The next day he visited the blacks. Bora Bora said he was ready to guide bim along the track, which led to where the booty 

 would be found. 

 The horse was tethered to a sapling, 

 he directed the lubra to watch him carefully. 

 'Come along,' Curlew said, 'lead the way.' 

 They went ,thronght the bush, separating the bushes with their arms, as they pushed ! through the spreading branches. A good thing for Curlew that he was an excellent bush - 

 man, and a good runner, for the blackfellow I kept at a running pace, over hilland through scrub; nothing was an obstacle to him. At length they found themselves overlooking a high perpendicular ravine. 

 Bora Bora pointing to a round spur of the range, said that was the place. Walking along to the top of the rocks, they found an opening, and jumping from ledge to ledge, with the assistance of the trees, both reached the bottom. Crossing this the blackfellow quickly gained the top of the grassy ridge, where blue stone boulders lay scattered about, as though shaken from a huge pepperbox, some being nearly hidden in the long wiry 

 grass. 

 Squatting in the inviting herbage, Bora 

 Bora motioned Curlew to do the same. 

 ' Blackfellow big feller yan,' he said ' 'fore me find um boot track; plenty day go long gully, ball me find um boot track; all track go bung, till one day go long this track, me find where yarram bin standing! plenty whitefeller tracks all 'bout; me follow 'em up gully, and long a ridge 'ere; follow 'em long a bit, what you call 'em� boulda, then can see plenty boots, same like 'em money.� Come now, Master Budolph.' 

 Jumping up, and starting at a slow run down the ridge, with Gurlew following, often stepping onto fallen trunks of trees, then off again, into holes, hidden by -the thickly growing oaten-eared grass, made by the stumps being burnt out during bush fires; at other times catching his legs in the vines trailing along the ground, till at last he per ceived the blackfellow standing under a group of trees. Quietly going to hi�, he was shown impressions upon the ground, which the blackfellow said were horse's hoofs, but too indistinct for Curlew to distinguish as 

 such. 

 * Ball yer no see 'em,' Bora Bora remarked, 'Blackfellow make 'em out plenty, it see yarraman, look 'ere, long fellow bit of bark, 

 ofi Tim tall.' . 

 And he held up a long horse-hair, that he 

 had found. 

 < I think you are right,' Curlew said. ' Now let me see where the money is.' 

 ' Ail right, Master Rudolph,' he said ; ' yan long up on ridge, me see 'em track, all way up, me show 'em you plenty.' 

 The blackfellow again taking the lead went slowly; his face close to the ground, appearing at times undecided as if having 

 lost the track; but the hesitation did not continue long, for he followed such marks as he could see, often pointing out to Curlew the tracks as he said, of two whitefellows. 

 The aboriginal has peculiar eyesight. A good tracker will .follow traces, and see foot prints when others could not perceive the slightest mark, either of indentation or of disturbed twig or stone. 

 Stopping before an ordinary boulder, near an old fallen stringy bark tree, Bora Bora motioned with his waddy,�meaning it was the hiding place; but again Curlew did not remark any peculiarity to denote a differ 

 ence. 

 * Go on,' he said; ' where's the plant.v 

 ' AJlright,' he said, " yer look me pull 'em saplin's.' 

 And he commenced clearing away the dead branches. Having removed these, he rolled the boulder away�and, there lay exposed a hole full of gold and silver coins. 

 Curlew was more than amazed, and uncon sciously looked about to see if he were per 

 ceived. 

 Then kneeling, he began counting the coins. When all of them were taken out, another surprise met his gaze; under the money were discovered seven chamois bags containing gold; these he estimated did not weigh less than five pounds each. 

 Curlew deliberated a few minutes, consid ering which would be the best plan to remove the rich plant. 

 He was not a man to waste time, finding the legal owner. Tears before when upon the dark green and ever blue waters of the roaring ocean, he had been taught, ' Every ?rnn-n for himself,' and this was not the first opportunity of carrying his early precepts into practice. 

 �You make um grass nose bags,' he said, budgery bag, nopiccaniny holes, carry booty long a gnnyah/ 

 Bora Bora moved away to pull some stringy bark from the trunks, and sat down, busy in plaiting the flexible material into shape; he completed three ordinary bags, or hand baskets, large enough to carry nearly all the gold and money. 

 Curlew placed the bags of gold in the bas kets. and the money that could not be packed into the bags he distributed in his pockets. 

 The black rolled the stone over the hole 

 una proceeded towards the high rocks, the top of which after some difficult climbing was again reached; they then continued wal&ing a few miles until Curlew noticed an admirable landmark, and a suitable place -to deposit the valuable treasures, not far from 

 the blacks' camp. 

 This being done, in half an hour they were at the cave. They were away nearly all day, walking continually, each having a good appetite. Eowani placed a portion of a wallaby upon the ashes of the fire, with skin and hair on. It was not long cooking, but sufficiently so for a famished blackfellow, that ir, just warmed through; and Bora Bora was in-the act of chopping a piece off with lis tomahawk, when Curlew prevented him. Though hungry as possible, and not over fastidious, he could not eat as a blackfellow.
