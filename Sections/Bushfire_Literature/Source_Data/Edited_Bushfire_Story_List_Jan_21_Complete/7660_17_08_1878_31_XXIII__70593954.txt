 CHAPTER XXIII. 

 They had, by passing through a gorge of the mountain locally termed "the gop," reached an elevated plateau which extended, on all 6ides, as far as the range of vision-u monotonous, heavily timbered region, in which outcrops of grey crenel- lated limestone Bhowed the chango of lormation from the basalt and granite they had remarked in the mountain ranges. Che cart was already sta- tioned under a small clump of trees, at a short dis- tance ; the smoke of a fire shewed that the persona in charge had performed what is generally held to be the iirst duty in Australia, alter a halt by the wayside. 

 " We had better leave our horses with the boys," said Miss Fane. " I think we shall luuch more comfortably after our scramble than before. If 

 you do not object, we will descend into the depths 

 n t nrm�." 

 Wilfred heartily assenting, all dismounted and unsaddled, th� horses being "nobbled" out upon the scanty grass-a supply of these useful fetters having been, by Miss Fane's forethought, sent in the cart. Following a narrow but well marked track, which led to a mass of neutral tinted boul- ders, they reached the mouth of the great Uurnon gah cave-a grim, circular, rugged opening in the earth-adown which, when they peered, little save a sensation of unknown depth was produced. 

 " Now, for the wax candles and matches," said Miss Fane. *' Regy, give Mr. Effingham one ! take one yourself, and one for papa ; see that he does not let his go out. Mind you keep close to him. Norman, you can stay with me, and don't go out of sight of us, or you shall never come to the caves again. You will see, Mr. Effingham, that we have had a rope ladder made, which takes us to the first chamber. It was too great a labour, and nearly perpendicular, before, though we had a single rope to help us. After the antechamber, as we call it. it is only reasonable scrambling. I think I will go 

 first." 

 Miss Fane looped up her riding-habit -with the help of certain feminine contrivances to that end adapted, and now taking a firm hold of the upper part of the ladder, which was fastened below, de- scended easily and in a leisurely manner. Dr. Fane followed, then Wilfred, and finally the two boys all Anding themselves in a damp atmosphere, 

 standing upon a floor of soft dusty nature alter-, nating with rocks, and over which it was singu- larly easy to break one's shins, 

 " Now let us light our candles," said Miss Fane, " and we shall see our path in life, more or less plainly." 

 An illumination being obtained, they found themselves in a moderate sized rock-chamber, the roof of which was only a few feet above their heads. Nothing interesting was to be seen ; but the additional lignt disclosed a passage leading downward at rather a sharp angle. 

 " Papa," said Miss Fane, " I think you and Eegy had better go first. I do not feel equal to pioneer- ing further. Take care you don't fall and do your- self an injury, and be sure and look where you are going, for once in a way." 

 The Doctor smiled good-humouredly and obeyed orders: "Are women gifted with so much foresight, you saucy damsel, or do they merely see clearly the immediate solitary effect, unheeuing of the chain of sequences which more philosophic man eau oalculate. But I defer to you as a cragswumau. In your childhood you were far too daring." 

 " I rarely get an opportunity of acquiring dis- tinction in that way, now," said the youn�lady, as they slipped and struggled down the incline, cling- ing at times to the damp walls, adown which trickled slow unending lines of silicated water. " It ia a dream of my life to ascend Muunt Blanc before I die. lt has been achieved by more than one woman, I know, or I should not think of it." 

 " Why not?" asked Wilfred, steadying himself upon a sharp pinnacle of slippery rock, and offer- ing her a temporary bupport. 

 "Because, except under pressure of circum- stances, I do not think it wise for a young girl to attempt the hitherto untried feat ; but whatever has been done, I Bhould think myself entitled tu attempt, without ostentation. 1 suppose you have had some Alpine travelling. How glorious I how enchanting it must be. I sometimes feel as if I could make a pilgrimage, like the people of the middle ages, all the way on foot, if it were but by land, and that I could die for one glimpse of the immortal glories of the classic lands." 

 " There aro many years before us both, 1 hope," said Wilfred, sagely. 41 It is a worthy ambition. Perhaps we may both meet on the steps of the Coliseum or at tho Hotel des Ambassadeurs, see sunrise on the J ungfrau together, in company with the usual rabble of tourist-pilgrinis. 13ut we shall never have money enough to pay our faros, if there is not a little more rain in this fine country of yours." 

 " Ah ! me," sighed the giri, " suppose �ne were doomed never to leave one's surroundings. It might be-it happens to many poor souls ; but I should die. It will go hard with me but I recross tho sea to the land ot' my ancestors. Isn't all this great nonsense ? Here we are, in the great hall, is it not worthy of Prastum, or Phihe, if wo only had some colossal statuary? Behold our alabaster stalactites : by making believe very much, as ' the marchioness' says, a good ideal picture can be sketched out in this dim light." 

 " What a magnificent hall !" said "Wilfred, as they moved forward and sat down upon a great block of limestone, shaped like a throne, " what a con- ception of vast-indeed illimitable-size is im- pressed upon one." 

 " Wait till we light more candles and tho fag- got," said Miss Fane. "The splendour of our palace of Black Mountain cannot be seen without illumination, Quick, boys !" 

 The youngsters now lighted a number of candles, which they fixed in the crevice of the columns which lined the sides of the cave, as also amid tha stalactites. At the same moment a light was ap- plied tu a bundle of burk aud twins, which had been rolled down the incline by the black boy. 

 The effect was magical. Wilired could not re- press a cry uf astonishment �nd deli., ht. A vast Vau ted hull, ol wiiich thu dome-like roof was high as that ot a cathedral, with rows and sneafs of columns, was revealed, to them, .-now-white sta- lactites of fantastic aud delicately moulded .shapes hung from the roof, sparkling like huge chande- liers filled with precious stones. The centre of the hull was occupied by a graduated mass of blocks, which closely resembled a Druidical altar. Spur-brilliants fretted the bluish-grey roof, Hash- ing and glittering with unearthly splendour. The 

 further end of the enormous chamber was lost in 

 dim uncertain vaporous light. At intervals, the sound of falling water, solemnly melodious, with rhythmical plash could be distinguished. The continuous rushing eouud of a subterraneous stream seemed the refrain of a weird " Geistichor." 

 All was strange, unearthly, vast, mysterious; a great and dread change from the every day prosaic 

 monotony �f the upper air. 

 44 One could fancy oneself in the judgment-seat of Ninns ," said Wilfred, " or of one of the earlier Kings of Egypt, who drove herds of starving slaves to build the pyramids. I feel like Kameses the 2nd, or Thotbnes the 24th." 

 "One always fancies," said his companion, " that life must have worn a dooper element of solemnity in those days. Toupie, surety, could not have smiled and sneered and chuckled over comic stories before the vast colossal architecture-before the constancy recurring death-woom and the ex- ecution in the public way. Laughter must be a faculty of modern growth." 

 " One hears of it occasionally among the most ancient writers," said Wilfred, " though the jokes were often meagre ; but life was a very serious matter to men of those days, abounding in chances of Unspeakable bliss or sorrow, lt is the exqui- site cultivation of all the faculties peculiar to modern life, joined to security, which hus led to the highest sensitive appreciation of humour, irony, wit,and comic mirth. Themen of this day are not, I would say, less earnest minded ; only the modern brain is bbtter fitted to receive complex ideas, and .to relieve pressure by variety of occupation." 

 " I daresay you are right," said the young lady. " I think we may explore yet another chamber, and you will see the famous Pit and a real sunless river, like as in Kubla Khan's palace. Wouldn't it be a charming place in summer, if it were more accessible ?" 

 They now descended an unpardonably slimy 

 and tortuous incline, where they had much diffi- culty in keeping their candles alicht. A smaller, more irregularly shaped, chamber, with a lower roof and more uneven floor, received them. 

 " This place has to me an aspect inconceivably gloomy and dismal," said Miss Fane; "it might do for the incantation scene in ' Der Freisch�tz,' � r one of the abodes in the inferno. How ghostly these bats, Hitting about. The air is more damp the water sounds more hoarsely. In truth we are near the Bottomless Pit, and that of itself is au awful consideration." 

 "Don't be careless in approaching it," said Doctor Fane; "these stones are slippery, and a sudden tremor or vertigo might have terrible 

 effects." 

 "I will take care," said Miss Fane ; " there is a broad stone ledge that we can lean over." 

 Heedf ully and silently they picked their steps across the uneven surface of the floor, until they reached the ledge. 

 Then they ould plainly distinguish the rough sides of the black, gaping, horror-striking abyss. lt was not less than thirty feet across the mouth. It descended sheer, and without the slightest in cine, to unknown, unguessed at depths. A falling stone elicited no sound. Vainly they listened for the plash or dull thud which tells, oven in the deepest shaft, when earth or water has been 

 reached. 

 " How terrible," whispered vera, in an awe stricken vuice ; "fancy what a death to die, to fall orer this ghastly rim oi the earth's crust, and then to be whirled away into the nether darkness un- knowing what one would reach, and utterly des- pairing of aid." 

 " It is not very likely to happen," said Dr. Fane. "Few persons, except ourselves, ever volunteer to ex- plore tbeselowerregions. Criiniualsand thesmaller depredators invariably avoid such localities, hav- ing but little love for nature and much lear for needless discomfort. I should not suppose that a creature had seen this place since our last visit, in midsummer." 

 But one more sensational experience remained ; that one they hastened to transact. Following the dripping wall of the cavern, they reached ano- ther hall of scarcely loss grand proportions than the first. 

 It was perfectly crowded with columns and irregular masses of stalactite, which, when illumi- nated, gave the appearance of endless columns and fantastic statuary. 

 "Thisis the 'Halie des milles colonnes,'" said Wilfred ; " what a pity they havn't got it in Paris what a caf� they would Tmike out of it ! Aud this is the ' sunless stream,'" he said. " How unreal unearthly, all!-where no sunlight glints on its ripples, no green hue of branch or meadow is re- flected in its depths, no bird drinks or preens its wing on its bosom. All is spectral, solemn, dark with the dread of night-darkness and an un- 

 known world. Where do its waters find an out- 

 let? Whence earnest thou, oh melancholy stream ? and whither flow thy ghostly waters ? Art thou a tributary /f tho Styx ? and do tho unburied dead dance and gibber nightly by thy wavo ?" 

 " There aro innumerable rifts and fissures in this formation," said the Doctor, unheeding anything but the geological probabilities; "the air sud- denly expanding, doubtless causes the greater and the lesser openings. It finds its way through the earth, doubtless into tho light of day, at some lower level. We aro here, on this table land, at a considerable elevation-more than livo thousand feet above the sen." 

 It was in truth a wondrous stream-clear and 

 pellucid, when lighted up, even to its greatest depths, lt flowed onward, with a deep unbroken 

 murmur, over the rocky bed until it reached the outlet, where its waters fell over a considerable height, causing the dull ceaseless sound which they had he�rd in the Great Hail. In the centre of the chamber was a pool ot' considerable size and depth, at the lowest depths of which, with the igtits, they could distinguish tn� smallest objects. Nothing living seemed ti� inhabit the solitary water ; the bats, which the boys occasionally dis- lodged, were the sole living occupants of these gloomy haunts. 

 " L.;t us ascend !" at length eaid tho Ductor. *. We have had a sufficient experience of Earth'B inner mysteries." 

 The homeward ride was through a line of country of J e.ss sensational character, which permited of tolerably fast riding. Emigrant Bwinginu along in the easy long-striding puce which only the blood horse of Britain can achieve, while Marigold and the roan charger of the Doctor, having their beads turned towards home, displayed paces very different frum those of the outward bound trip. 

 The evening passed quickly, in the review and criticism of a phalanx of authors, known'and loved, as only those (rienda ol the human race can be, by the trained inmates of libraries from child- hood, Wilfred felt himself in thoroughly cn ge- nial society, and only lamented thia so long and difficult a march interposed between War- brook and this refined and intellectual oasis. 

 The following day his host-prevailed upon him to accompauy him to an out station; The JJrolgah, as it was called. This was a curious depression, some milos in extent, surrounded by �natural walls of rock, almost perpendicular. This encl osure, of Nature's making, could only bo entered by ono narrow pass, the mouth of which wus securely fenced. The cattle were driven with some diffi- culty through this defile; but, once in, were per- mitted to roam at large through tho wilds of the "sunk country," as the stockmen called it. A clear, full, flowing stream bisected the enclosure, thus securing the two great pastoial requisites of grass and water. Even in the terrible season, the herbage was nutritious, the stock thriving. 

 Here, as they rode through tho oppressive lone- liness of this half subterranean kingdom, where the fantastic shapes of the rock fastnesses seemed like the homes of Ghouls and Afreets, a fit of musing silence fell upon "Wilfred's entertainer. Suddenly arousing himself, he turned towards him and thus spoke, half glancing at the tottering stock- man's hut and half decayed yards, which they were then passing : 

 " You have doubtless wondered that all our sur- roundings are of such a meagre description. "When I bought Black Mountain run, more than twenty years since, I was aspiring and sanguine, like others ; had ideas ol' making money and enlarging my boundaries. But �/.� died who was my life's load-star, my best friend and counsellor, my chief 

 aid and incentive to exertion. Since then I have lived a hermit life, careless of all but provision for the obvious needs of my family. My ambition is bounded by the means to furnish an education for my boys and a maintenance, in the future, for my brave, patient, true-hearted daughter. She, I fear, has. been the sufferer by my long indulged seclu- sion. I would willingly sanction her spending a large portion of every year with our friends, in Sydney ; but she will not hear of it, deeming it her duty to share my seclusion and manage our poor 

 household." 

 " It argues the most elevated and self-denying habit of mind," said Wilfred, half uncertain as to how he should reply to the old man's rapidly poured forth confidences, which he seemed relieved at being able to impart to a congenial, listener. 

 Tue loneliness of a pastoral life, eave in rare cuses, deems the grent drawback in Australia. We have exceptional social advantages, in our neighbour- hood. But I can well imagine how many families, yours among the number, suffer from the inevit� 

 abie isulaiiun." 

 " It is true," said tho Doctor, reflectively. " It must be hard to bear, especially by the young. For myself, I care little-my library is my .world. But 1 would give more than 1 could say, if I could bo certain that poor Vera ana the boys, after me, wouid have the unspeakable blessing befitting of association. I undervalued the necessity when they were in the nursery. Now I see my error, as is the way of many things in this-life, too late to repair it." 

 1 can fully enter into your feelings, my dear sir,"eaid Wilfred. " Still, one should never- des- pair, particularly iu this land, where events march last-of unexuected turns in one's iavour. It is hard to prophesy, while this iron season has us all in its grixjo. But a season of plenty-as in the old days of Israel's famine - will surely succeed that of the withered eur ol' corn and the lean kine." 

 .* It may be so," said the old man, mildly. " I am becoming too old to cherish hopes of sudden good fortune. I may be able to see, before 1 die, some such improvement in our position Mean- while, beliove mo, that your visit has been produc- tive of unusual pleasure, and even advantage, to every resident of this forlorn outpost." 

 You must have been taking Mr. Effingham, what Ben calls, ' ali over tho run,'"said MissFane, as thoy returned at sunset. " I trust you have both good appetites for the dinner I have been com- posing for your benefit. * A g> -od bushman is known by his appetite,' Mr. iS�Rnghum-you may add that to your stock of Australian proverbs." 

 "If my bushnmnship was nenrJy equal tb my appetite, generally," replied Wilfred,- " I ouglt to turn out a dibtinguisbed explorer, at tb el east. I shall consider myself HS destined to a very exalted position in tho annals ot my adopted country henceforth, entirely on your responsibility. Look out for my name in all future despatches." 

 "I trust you will he able to give a good account of my housekeeping," said she, ns they eat down to a moro effective repast than housekeepers in the provincee, alas I caro to attempt. 

 The JDoctor disappeared for a few moments, and returned with a couple of bottleB of hock, which, lator on, testified to the judgment of Rock- ley and Co. as importers. 

 " I trust we have quite concluded our prepara- tions," said Miss Fane. " Let no ono rise from the table again without my permission, and we shall be as nearly comfortable as people can hope to bo in a dry season. W7hat a terrible fire that must have been at Mr. Forbes's. "You were there, Mr. Effingham? "We saw it in the papers; and poor 

 Captain Snowdon, too, how sudden and dreadful 

 I only met him once, at the races. How^shockec you all must have been." 

 " I shall never forget that day as long as I live,' said Wilfred. "There may be other fires, butfnone will ever come up to that one. It was sufficientlj terrible for a heralding of the Last Day. What u picture it would have madel Hut how did you 

 escape ?" 

 " Ours is what is called a green grass coun- try, inferior but safe, and more than respectable in a dry season like this. We never have bush fires here. We are too patchy with reeds and heath to burn. A poor run, and despised in good seasons, ours has its advantages-beautiful water, with insurance against bush fires." 

 "Black Mountain belongs to the category of small kingdoms wisely governed, though neither rich nor extensive. Switzerland, to wit. Such have made thoir mark in the world's history be- 

 fore now." 

 " Thanks for the compliment, we must all try and deserve it ; and if Regy will learn his Latin, Norman work for his scholarship, and papa keep his accounts correctly-always supposing the rain comes some day-we may ilourish yet. But it is very weary work, waiting for a drought to end. Months roll on, while Nature seems slowly dyiug and calling us to attend her funeral. I suppose it 

 will be long before the hounds meet at Warbrook I again." 

 "They are now domiciled with Mr. Hampden,"1 said Wilfred. "He was good enough to take charge of them until . this tyranny be overpast.' I em afraid it will be many a day before we have sufficiently light hearts to follow them again." 

 "And the old whipper-in-Tom something or otherP"-asked Miss Fane, "how does ho get on? I felt rather interested in him-he rode so well." 

 " He has left our employ, and I hardly know where he is." 

 " Left Warbrook ?" said Miss Fane, in amaze- ment. "I should have thought he could never uit Lake William, and yourfamily." 

 "There is rather a ead story connected with him," said Wilfred. " You must ask Rosamond to tell you, when you next visit us. Surely we may hope to see you some day or other?" 

 " The next time I go to Yass, I will make Mr. Rockley take me over ; but when that will be, I 

 cannot tell.' ' 

 .'1 must send some one xo ;uuu- a mob of your cattle," said Wilfred. " is not that the recognised idiom ? Then you and the Doctor will be obliged to come. But you will have to be quick, as I think we shall make a general exodus in spring." 

 " What, all the Lake Wil liam brigade ?-as Mrs. Snowdon calls them-the Benmohr firm, Mr. Ardmillan, and that pleasant droll Mr. Churbett it will be a national loss. I wish Mr. Churbett lived near to us. He is so amusing." 

 " Fred is one of the best fellows in the world. 

 We positively can't spare him. Any other recpiest isgranted.as a matter of course." 

 On the morrow, after a praiseworthy early break- fast, at which Miss Fane presided as if it were no- thing new to be equipped for the day at six o'clock "a.m., in the morning," as Mr. Chuckster ex- plained, That gentleman would have had some ground for considering it " so everlastingly early" if he had noticed the cattle filing out of the yard, as the sun's rays gilded the sullen mountain 

 spur. 

 When the last adieux were made, Wilfred fancied there was a slight but distinct expression of regret in Miss Fane's countenance-a wistful look in the true grey eyes, whose untroubled gaze he had so often deemed to be the translucent mirrors of a spotless soul. Had he known-could he but have seen-how a shrouding sadness fell cloudlike over the bright face, how dim grew the day's clear light, how pale and void the monotoned round of duties-he would have felt deeply touched and regretful. Mayhap, being a man-one of a sex that holds cheap all too easy conquest-he would have scorned the offering of a pure, unworn, maiden's heart. Such blindness ot spirit is doubt- less confined to the Bterner sex, who, it is noto- rious, always exhibit those adamantine traits of 

 character from which all-favoured womanhood is proverbially free. And at what a heedless, un- ripe age do such lifelong mistakes occur ! Piteous is it to think, that when the girl picks up a shining pebble or worthless mock ingot and places it in her bosom, or the boy casts down a diamond or tender glowing pearl into the dust of the high- way, there is no one to say thom nay-to explain, 

 to warn, to restore. 

 No ! the die is cast ; and the gay laugh, or childish pout, ratifies the eternal deed, from the consequences of which, in this life at least, there is no appeal. Is there a land where the bonds of the mourners are broken-where the loved and lost, meeting, may cling together in supernal passion- ate ecstncy, never to bo parted ? We know not. Untiu this lower earth, wherein we disport ourselves in this our little hour, it would sometimes seem ns if the demons of the inferno had power, as of old, to delude and ensnare-to part those whom heaven's angels have joined, or to link in fetters that ever wound and burn the tender and the ! pitiless, the true and the false, the spotless lamb 

 of the Hock and the ravening remorseless wolf.
