 CHAPTER XI. 

 / V can't get this right anyhow!" said Carlotta, with a sigh, screwing tip thought ful eyes over a long column of ligurcs. Jenny, the black girl, looked over her ' shoulder. 

 "Turn that p'fella up other-way-side- down, jllissie, and perhaps him come right." "I think I might just as well, Jenny, for all the sense I can get out of it. 1 never shall be any good at ligures, that's a fact !" "Let Mis' Andrews do dat," said Jenny, cheerfully. She did not see why the over seer should not do her mistress's private accounts� anything to keep Missie from looking worried. "Andrews !" Carlotta sniffed contemp tuously. She had seen too much of Andrews lately � Andrews and his un quenchable gloom. There was always somolhiug wrong when Andrews (fame to report. Sheep bogged in the reservoirs, or lambs taken by eagle hawks, meu on strike for higher wages, teamsters setting lire to tho grass at the Five Mile, neighbors hold ing sheep with disfigured earmarks that looked like foul play, blacks bringing rum n to the station � always was there some evil afoot when Andrews eame to tell his tale. "Here he comes now !" she said, without enthusiasm, as, looking through the win dow of her little office, where a thirsty grape vine clambered, Carlotta saw a long person with a saturnine countenance straggling through the front gate. Strag gling iB the only word which will fitly de scribe Andrews's movements, for his arms were long and lean, and one leg was a little Bhorler than the other, which seemed to sag over towards its fellow. Carlotta sighed again as she heard the drag of his spur along the verandah ere he came in at the open door, for it was a stifling day, and door and windows were set wide for every breath of air. " 'Day," said Andrews, propping him self up against the door post, and eyeing Carlotta with his melancholy brown eye. Jenny discreetly withdrew. "Good morning, Mr. Andrews. How is your wife to-day?" "No better 'n no worse; but I doubt she'll be worse by night time." "Oh ! She may not. I will send some soup round to-day." "The last you sent made her that bad, I kep' my 'orse saddled all night for the doctor� thanking you all the same, ma'am." -The least little twitch, that might have meant suppressed laughter, came to Car lotta s lips. She had been more than a year tiying to learn to manage her pro perty, which she had taken over hampered by a big overdraft, the knowledge of which she felt might have accounted for poor Bens many little economies, and she did not think she had become very skilful yet. She felt that Andrews was an honest man and that was a great thing, where a dis honest one could have run rings round her- but his incurable pessimism was rather try ing. "I am sorry the soup did not agree with her, Andrews. I will try jelly instead, if we can get it to set in the bathroom. Any thing to report?" "Nothin' much, 'cept that someone left the slip rails down in the Home paddock and the stallion got out' and crossed over to Royce s, the selector's, and had a fight with his entire, and got pretty badly kicked and his shou der tore with Boyce's barbed wire. Thought I'd have to slioot him this mornin, but he may pull through." An drews looked as if he doubted it. "Anything else?" asked Carlotta .shortly; she telt out of temper this morning; she ahvays was the day she made up her ac counts. "West has give notice." "Whv? T R .nnl/l 1��A t-u . 

 - � - .....v, uwii tuia oi tnis before. My husband thought a lot of West- he had ueen with him so long. I do not like to see tlic old hands going." Andrews examined the ceii'mg with his lugubrious glance. "There's white ants comin' there, I believe," he muttered sotto voce, and then to Carlotta, "Well, it was . this way; West's courtin' a girl in the township, and I sez lie was a fool." "I don't see what it had to do with vou Andrews. " "West up and laughs nasty like, and I scz .e is a fool again." "Oh!" Carlotta stamped her foot impa- <mly,.0n boards- "Go on," she said. Well� one thing and nnother-and him Jvantin leave to go into the township all faundays, and the mustering comin on." You quarrelled with him, I suppose, An drews, and thut is why he gave notice. He should have come to me. These men seem to treat me as a cipher." She looked fixedly at Andrews. She sus pected him of taking too much authority sometimes. "Well, ma'am, to tell 3011 the truth I sometimes think they only look, on myself as a siphon, too." Andrews began to out up tobacco, and to roll it round in. his palm, in true bushman fashion. Carlotta put a little straying tendril of hair back behind her ear. She looked ab surdly young and girlish in her grey print frock with its severe whito collar and cutis. "Did you see those travelling sheep through yourself yesterday?" she asked. We are getting awfully short of grass; you Must not let these travelling mobs eat us bare. "They was the hungriest lot what ever came along," said Andrews, gloomily. "It ick'na ""my tima beatin' round them, and then MLuekie must go and square up to the drover. "I suppose he thought he was protecting my grass. Send him to me, Andrews. 1 like loyalty." "He can't come, ma'am. He's in his bunk with two black eyes and a sprained jvrmt. The drover was a fightin' man." '\\ou are short handed then? You will have to put on another man for the mus tering this afternoon." "A fellow came in just now lookin' for ..Work. Likely sort of chap," "Put him on, then." Andrews drew out a very black pipe and eyed it sadly, shaking his head. "I was just going to, ma'am, when he threw a fit there by the wool store. A man like that might create a panic among the sheep." Carlotta sighed. "I daresay I could give you a hand my self," she said. "Tell them to put my horse in the yard, and have him saddled by two- That is ivhen you will got away, isn't "Your hack has been turned out this week," said Andrews, filling his pipe with precision and much pressure of a nicotine stained thumb. "She was getting a sore back; it's that new fangled liuutin' saddle." "That's all nonsense. These hunting saddles are well known to save horses' backs; she's perfectly fit. Send the black hoy out after her, and understand, An drews, that I intend to help with the mus tering to-day." "She's out in the Ten Mile; couldn't get' her in by two." Andre vs was quite un- tuflled. "Then I will ride Black Sue. That is settled. Good morning, Andrews. Let me know how the stallion gets on, and I will send a liniment across for M'Luekie." You can t ride Black Sue, unless you want to break your neck, ma'am. The last lady who rode her ivas smashed agin' a tree. She is 'that scaart of petticoats. She's fresh, too, been out to grass." Andrews was gradually, straggling to wards the door, seeing the wrath gathering on Carlotta's brow, i' Carlotta turned her -back and began to ram her papers into, a drawer in the writ- ' ' " " ' ' "( ' V : 

 ing table, already top full, and jammed her fingers. As Andrews shambled out of the door, and down the verandah, she called after him, "Do not forget to tell the black boy to have Sue saddled at 2 o'clock." Then she went out to the kitchen to order early lunch for herself. Andrews went slowly across to the sta tion, meeting one of the stockmen on the way. He jerked an expressive thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the house. "She's coming to give a hand with the mus tering this afternoon, " he said stonily. The stockman smiled sadly, "You bet your life," he answered ironically. "Fat lot of help women, anyway." But when Andrews had passed him he shook his head gravely. Secretly ho ad mired Carlotta's appearance excessively, and bemoaned the fact that she took such an interest in the workings of the station. Between them the men could have managed so much better � certainly to their own satisfaction. It had been a fat billot to be a stockman here in Ben's time, for the manager let tho station hands do pretty well as they pleased while he spent hilarious hours in the township. Hence perhaps the over draft, which, spite of Carlotta's struggles, had not appreciably diminished. Punctually at 2, Andrews had the pleasure of seeing his lady boss ride forth with the inusterers. In duty bound he -rode on her right and opened the gates for her. He pointed out the most likely parts of the run to be de vastated by bush fires if the dry weather continued, and drew her attention to the shallowness of the creek they forded. In another two months lie reckoned it would run dry, and there would be nothing but bogged slicop on their hands. "I fancy I can smell the dead wool now," he said cheerfully. It was something of a relief to reach tlio paddock where the weaners were bid ing in the scattered timber, though to follow weaners on a hot day when thu dust rises white from your horse's hoofs, and the sun heats down on your poorly protected head, is not the height of enjoy ment. For surely the most stupidly . Mis chievous tilings in the world are the young sheep called weaners! They always go the very way they are not wanted to go, and when there is a lady with the muster ing party, and you can't swear as much as you would like to, and what you do swear must be sworn low, it is indeed, hard for men to keep their tempers. The young stockman wished again and again that Carlotta had stayed at home, and once, after an ineffectual attempt to start a mob through the slip rails, as they broke back with stubborn persistency, he suddenly put spurs to his horse arid galloped away across a little open plain regardless of melon holes, while liis mates turned to wonder if Tim had unexpectedly gone mad. But, as lie explained to a sympathetic mate afterwards, he felt obliged to get away for a few minutes where there were nothing but a few coolibahs to hoar him swear, lest he should "fair bust," and he returned lamblike and serene for the rest of the afternoon, though some say that the gum leaves in the vicinity of his ride curled as they do in a blast of hot air. With a loop of her dusky hair hanging over one ear, from under her panama hat, flushed face and dust-smarting eyes, Car lotta stuck to her task and actually suc ceeded in successfully rounding up some of the most frisky of the flock. She felt rather pleased with herself when they vodo homo behind the now steadying sheep, as dusk began to gather about the boles of the gum troes and a certain beauty came to the flat unlovely country, for there was not any beauty of greenness noiv about the sparsely timbered places, no herbage on the plains but the dry yel lowing grass, and hero and there a busli of dull grey thirsty saltbush glistening in the slanting rays of light. , As she slipped off her saddle stained liolland habit and called Jenny to bnnV the dust out of her long hair, Carlotta 

 felt quite satisfied that she really had helped to-day. "It is so nice to have an object in life," she said absently to Jenny. "Something accomplished, something done, lias earned a night's repose, eh, Jenny?" Jenny smiled broadly; she did not know in the least what Carlotta was talking about, hut she loved .to be told to brush out her silky hair. Meanwhile Andrews, sitting by his wife's bedside, groaned aloud. "I feel quite wore out, Maria," lie said. "Oil, Lnwrd! It the women folk would only stay nt home!" Marin agreed. She loved her bed, and would never have got out of it if such nu exertion could have been avoided; besides Alalia always agreed with Andrews; it saved wear and tear � for Andrews had a small head and a long ehin. Maria was a soft, billowy sort of person, whose waist was not definable except by the string of her apron, and whose shoes were always down at heel, and sliu loved the I'rincesi novelette beyond anything except her bed, as afore mentioned. The small faced maid ens, with lily necks and eyes as large as saucers, and waists ho bigger than their necks, were a source of joy to Maria, whose life had run upon unromantic lines. Once, by mistake, she boiled Andrews's moleskins in along with the salt beef, stir ring with the pot stick in one hand and a ragged copy of the novelette in the other. She never told Andrews, though he was vaguely disturbed at the way his moles "swented," nnd blamed the storekeeper in the township for selling him bad goods. The small faced maidens in the novebtte, however straitened their circumstances, could live in the hope� always verified� ol marrying a Duke in disguise whom a run away horse invariably threw at their door steps. It was only to take him in and tend him and press a snowfiake hand to his burning brow (Duke's brows always burn), and presently there were "the sil ver chimes of wedding bells" and the tenantry� such a nice, big sounding word � dragged the fiery horse from the carriage, nnd amidst "ringing cheers" brought the Duke and the new made Duchess (ux- Saucer-eyes) to the "ancestral halls." An cestral halls ! Was it any wonder that Maria boiled beef nnd moleskins together? For Maria secretly worshipped the qua lity, ' Andrews was a man of many theories, and he objected strongly to women having the franchise. They at least were not men's equals, though he called himself a. Socialist and had been known to yc;l "Down with Capital" at election times. The last time (in the days of the ea-y- going manager) he hud attended an election meeting iu the township his interjections had been repressed by a large creature of brawn and muscle who sat next to him, and who was in favor of the present can didate. Every time Andrews opened his mouth in bitterness, a large freckled and hairy hand descended "smack" across his lips, and effectually silenced him. The man was too large, and withal too good tempered to accept 'Andrews's invitation to "come outside," "You'd better go outside yourself, my man, and stay there," was all the brawny one would say, and Andrews never forgot the indignity. He left off' mixing in polities, and contented himself with a gloomy "This country is going to the dogs � it's not worth a man's time to go to the poll these days," when election matters were mentioned before him. lie hinted darkly at abuse of the postal vote and hanky-panky with ballot hox.'s, and Maria was always afraid lie might get him self intermixed with a libel case. That Maria now had a vote was very distressing to bim. He looked upon her with a kindly contempt � his attitude to wards all women � that Maria never re corded her vote was little comfort to liirn, since the power was hers if she likecj to use it, and he had a private doubt of Maria's . loyalty to the Labor party. - in faot, ho suspected her, in spite of her reti cence on the subject, of having leanings towards the anti-Socialists. She had the pictures of the Duke and Duchess of York, , & : 

 a print which had appeared in a Queens land paper white the Koyal tour was in progress, tacked on to her bedroom wall, and when she lay in bed she kept her eyes fixed meditatively upon it. Who could fathom even Maria's thoughts? Perhaps in imagination she moved through palaces, dragging a red velvet train along marble halls and patronising lesser lights.. She wondered exceedingly at Carlotta for riding about the run with the . men and taking an active part in the station man agement. In Carlotta's place she would have "reclined" upon a sofa all day, read her light literature and commanded the black girl to bring her cool drinks. Once, when she had been up to the house on some trifling matter, she had found Car lotta seated on the verandah with a large red volume on her knee, which proved to be "The Sheep Diseases Act of 19�/' which the ladj Boss was studying with more or less understanding. Maria was properly shocked. She did not think it at all nice reading for a lady. Saucereycs, now, would never have done sucli a thing, though she read "Greek in the original" (whatever that was!). It is wonderful what culture the ladies iu the Princess novelette have acquired in the intervals of catching Dukes. Besides, she did not like the way in which Carlotta dressed. "Too plain like no velvet, and not a bit ol' salting about her, nor the sign of an ostrich feather when she went into the township/' "just a linning frock � short enough to show her boots � and a bit of 11 sailor hat with a black and white band like a magpie !" If she goes on like this," agreed An drews sadly, "I wonder how she'll be gettin' another husband? I wouldn't marry her myself� with her 'cad so full of motions� and that's flat, Maria!" Andrews had . a settled conviction that women were always on the outlook for hus bands. But unconscious of the unfavorable com- mcnt rife in men's hut and overseer's cot-, bifie, Carlotta kept on her w<iy. She sent r1 11 PamPhlct on "Bookkeepiiit; Made Easy," and grew more muddled than ever in her accounts. She went in for heavy reading nnd studied Scotcli history, linger ing always over the romantic hits, and blaming herself for not remembering the dates. She hunted through chapters for everything that touched upon the life of Bonnie Prince Charlie � always a fascinating figure to her, and recalled witii a sigh many delightful talks she had had with Borlaise and poor De Silva on the subject. The news of De Silvn's death had come so close upon her own bereavement that it Bcemed inextricably intermixed with that dark time, and when she thought of De Silva it brought up vivid memories of Ben. Of Borlaise she liud heard iittle since the conventional- lino of sympathy lie had sent on hearing that she was a widow. A letter received some months ago from Miss Cnr- lyle had told her tlmt he wns travelling in New Zealand. Lucky Borlaise! She would dearly have liked to have travelled herself, to find those wonderlands of the Old World she had so often dreamed about, but her circumstances forbade it. So she must be content with her rows and. rows of gum trees and the long dry yellow grasses of the plains, where the sun beat all day long till the earth cracked and cried aloud for heal ing showers. Sometimes when the dusk was settling down on the attempt at garden � which the hard soil and scarcity of water never allowed to become more than an attempt � a deep sense of loneliness would steal over Carlotta, and she would wish to hear little Tedward's voice outside her door as he rattled at the door knob with small impatient fingers, "Am you there? Is your light lighted?" and the clatter of san dalled feet. A gay post card or two she had sent him, and they had dropped out of each other's lives, and Tedward, child like, had turned to fresher interests with scarce a thought to "the lady what told about fairies" in such a beguiling manner. A few friends in this district (where tlic stations were so far apart that visiting was rendered difficult) she had, hut for the most part she lived a solitary life. 

 At present she felt no desire to invite girl friends from Brisbane to stay with her, for what amusement could she offer tliom, and what comfort? The knockabout man was filled with pride if lie coukl raise a small cabbage in the vegetable gar den, and the potatoes carted up from the < farming districts were 25/ a bag, and half ! bad at that. The mutton and beef were j lean, so there was no suet for puddings, and boiled rice and dried apples from the | station store were the staple sweets, varied i occasionally by a disli of boiled sago or a blanc mange � the latter something of a luxury, as it took so much milk, and the cows were nearly dry. ' Her- rockery she determinedly watered, though the knockabout warned her, by beating with a stick on tlic rings of the galvanised iron tanks, how low tho water was getting, and there was some talk of carrying water in casks from the arm of ; the river that curved through the run, whicli would entail a lot of labor, but Car- j lotta said she must have something green ' to look upon, and she loved her ferns. It was a real pleasure to her to see the fresh young fronds, like cowled monks banding their brown heads, and then gradually un curling, looking up and laughing- out into green leaves, shining, quivering with life. Between the rocks, which she and Ben j hud gone to so much trouble to collect, for there was little stone about the run and few ridges, were layers of moss, and the fairy cups were greedy for water. Some times a tiny woed with a 6iuall blue flower peeped shyly out from among the fern, and Carlotta had not the heart to pull it up, though she would shake a menaeiug finger at it. "You've 110 business here, you know!" slie would say. "it is all I can do to keep my ferns alive without your cropping up!" And Andrews, one day . overbearing her, wont hack to Maria with a preteriinlurally grjive face and the information that lie was "pretty sure Mrs. Davis was goiug ratty.' Maria said, "Dear! Dear!" and took -to l)cr hed to think it over, telling her lord that she felt "that upset." And Carlotta bent down nnd caressed the fine green laces of llie ferns, and was glad for something at least to love. One day she had a long letter from a friend of hers who was honeymooning in Isew octtiuuJ. "Wc stayed at a lovely little wooden hotel, like a Swiss chalet, amongst the hills," she wrote, "in tiie North Island; a horribly inflammable little plnce; but I daresay you have read of it in the papers." Carlotta shook her head; New Zealand papers did not penetrate here. "There was | no fire brigade, ol" course, for it is a long way from R , and the place kia/.cd like mad. Jack managed to get me out, and, what was better, all my boxes, so 1 did not lose any of my new things. And there was everybody camped on the glass, congratu lating themselves for having escaped, and the hotelkceper walking aboutand swear ing and praying alternately, and the red glow on the bills showing up ull the black, straggly pines, when suddenly someone re membered a little Maori girl who had been brought in to help with the rush of visi tors. She was sleeping up a crazy little stair in an attic right at the top. Jack said lie would try to get her out, hut I liung on to him and screamed� you know I am fairly solid � and lie couldn't get away. And while all the others were 'thinking about it, a man quietly wrapped a blanket round his head and body, and fetched a long ladder that no one had thought about from an outhouse and set it against the back wall, which was smoking and flaming in places, and went to the rescue. And although the girl was scorched before he got her, being quite stupified by smoke, or thinking she had to die anyway� the way these Maories do � sitting down to death, as it were, he had only his front hair frizzled and the toes of his slippers burned. We made quite a hero of him, I can tell you, for it -urns a brave thing to do, and he took a different route, so as not to be with our 

 party as we moved on, for he couldn't bear to bo fussed over or pointed out as the man who saved the girl. I believe it sent him hack to Queensland sooner than lie intended. I never thought to ask him if he knew you, though he eomes from your parts. His name is Borlaise." Carlotta's eyes filled with tears; she was glad! She was glad to know that it was Borlaise who had done thiB thing � Borlaise who had forgotten her. It was well to hear of brave deeds, it made one think more leniently of poor human naturo which is so often tried and found wanting. It was especially -well to hear it of Borlaise. And when Jenny came in to lay the luncheon cloth, Carlotta wns seated at the diningroom table with the Sheep Diseases Act upside down in front of her, the bride's letter open between the leaves. And the letter was not upside down. As shearing time approached Andrews's settled melancholy increased alarmingly. He wns sure there would be strikes in the shed this year nnd he mistrusted the shear er's slushy. "An' if the cook ain't satisfac tory you know what it is with the, men," he said darkly to Carlotta. "They can get another if they don't like that, one," responded Carlotta briskly. "If we could only get a little rain to lay the dust before the shed begins, Andrews, it would he a blessing indeed." In my opinion we are in for a three years drought and no less, if not more," continued the overseer, "I know the look of the sky!" "But the sky changes in a night." Carlotta did not deny to herself that the outlook was not promising. The station was wrapped. in clouds of choking dust all day now, while the mustorers were bring ing in the sheep. The man who threw fits had been charitably given a post as penner up, where he coukl not do much harm, and' every day rouseabouts and shearers were arriving, some of those who had up to date notions arrived hag and baggage on bicycles whicli are the best kind of horses to pos sess in drought time, though a terror in time of flood, when it means a man having to carry Ins -steed across the black soil plains, instead ofTvice versa. Some shear- era still stuck to the old fashioned mode of hack and pack horse, and the cheerful tinkle of the horse hulls woke the echoes along (he creek. At night from the hut came the long drawn sorrow of the accor dion and the wheeze of a damaged violin played by a musical carrier. The drays began to jolt in, and the teamsters camped by the rapidly .drying water holes, and the bony bullocks added the' jangle of their bells to the other melodies of night. Car lotta had secured a capable shod overseer and a certificated wool cla6scr, and hoped that the present clip� though the weather was so unfavorable for the season's lambs � would help to clear something off the overdraft. Only Andrews was without hope, and shook his small head from morn ing to night, until Maria feared that he would get a crick in his neck, and ven tured to remonstrate with him. "Tilings ain't always so bad as they ap peal's to be comin'," she said lucidly. But Andrews frowned. "Women don't understnn' them things," he said; then witheringly, "She's employ ing non-union carriers. Oh! Lordy! Lowly I And union men in the shed. There'll be the deuce to pay this time, Maria, mark my words," and, raising his voice, "Don't talk about what you don't com-pre-hend, now!" Marin retreated. The Duke never talked to Saucer-eyes like that. , Andrews had found from past experience .that Maria was easily routed. Once started, the dry weather was an ad vantage for getting through shearing quickly. There could he no cry of "wet sheep" nor discontent on that account. The slushy turned out to be a first class cook in spite of Andrew's premonitions to' the contrary, and there were only two fights among the men on the first Sunday, and neither ended in damage. Carlotta went down the shearing floor and smiled at the ringer, a great red-bearded Scotchman, dis-. cussed Ruskin with the bale brander, a man of dissipated appearance, "with 'the Voice of an educated English gentleman, 

 tlliU UlulIK aLlUilg ICd.TUIt Ul (1 BUI/ JUb UUU eat n chunk of "brownie" with more or less enjoyment, during "snioko," seated on a bale of "greasy," while the shed overseer kept down any tendencies to "blaukies" along the board with a firm and hairy list. The night was full of the thin bleating of ewes in the pens, nnd the day was full of the shouts nnd remarkable noises made to encourage the sheep by the penners. up, and the short, shnip bark of station dogs. Strange men drifted 'in and wanted jobs, und drifted on further down the river, ivliere the other sheds were sturling. 'The first bales began to swing off the wool loading stuge into tho table top waggons, nnd the creak of the crane could be heard over at the house. One Sunday tiie Presbyterian minister rode out from the township and held scr- vice in the shed, nnd the men strolled in and said he wasn't "half a had sort," and strolled out again when they got boretl, to "head it" down by the creek under the weeping myall trees. Somebody started a hymn, and a chorus from outside joined lustily, and the dust drifted in through the shed windows and golden motes danced along the empty shearing floors, and Car lotta and Jenny and the Irish cook in lier best hat, sat on forms und listened to tiie sermon, supported by Andrews and Maria, and such of tiie station, hands who wero not Roman Catholics, and who thought the lady boss would like them to put in an ap pearance. Tiin, the stockman, was there, absently saying "Amen" in the wrong place, but saying it heartily, and putting a shilling lie luid won the night before Ironi a shearer in a bet about a dog into the hat, which was carrieil round in lieu of a plate. It was unfortunnte that the man who threw fits should have insisted upon attend ing (being a member of the Church of Scot land and an upholder of his kirk) ; it was unfortunate that he should have found it necessary to fall upon liis back and kick .wildly during the lust prayer, and have to be put under tlic pump by too officious Tricnds from outside; but tlic parson, being a sensible loan, overlooked the interrup tion nnd subsequently enjoyed his lunch ot roast fowl (.the last of Carlotta's hens sacri ficed to the exigencies of drought time), whicli he partook ot at the house in the company of liis graceful hostess,- for whom lie hud a great admiration� not only on ae- eomrt-. of her personal charms, but for the interested maimer in whicli she aiways ap peared to listen to his sormons. Later lie rode on down the river to finish his evening at a selector's who had twins to be ehristeued, and as lie went lie nicdi- tated � for lie was a widower� on the ad vantages of remarriage, and on lie sort of wife Carlotta Davis would make. True he had heard that her ideas upon religious matters were not entirely orthodox, but she had never expressed her opinions tu him. She had always been sweetly gra cious and ready to agree to liis holding service on the station nt any time that pleased him, though at intervals he hud noticed a certain abstraction in her gaze, but no doubt she had a great deal to think about. Yes ! He decided, as lie turned in nt tlic selector's slip rails und saw some small and partially clad forms run like rabbits and disappear behind the slab hut where the twins awaited him, yes ! remarriage was to be contemplated witii some satu- faction, for "it is not good for man to live alone," -saith the Scriptures. Then something smote liis heart Willi a pang of self-reproach, as he slipped oil his noise and gave the twins,' mother time to tie a clean apron above her winsey gown. What would wee Jeanic, who slept so quietly now under the purpling heather, say if she knew that he had thought to fill her place � what would the leal wife, whom lie had so truly mourned, say to Car lotta's brown liair and strange deep eyes, whicli so often seemed to look at him nn- seeingl.v? lie sighed as lie unfastened the saddle pouch whicli held his papers from his sweating horse. Ho would think it all well over before he partook of Carlotta's roast fowl again. For he did not know that it was the last of the hens he had dined upon to-day. (To be Continued.)
