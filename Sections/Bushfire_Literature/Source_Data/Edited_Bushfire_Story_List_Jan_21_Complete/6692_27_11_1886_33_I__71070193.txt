 - - ' , CHAPTER I. 

 . It. waa the last night the passengers hoped to spend on board the Seabird j for, after a long and tedious ! r. voyage, she had " dropped anohor in Hobson's Bay. Ono. might .think that\\ after sp�ndingrs,o many nights on board the vessel, this 

 last oi^jifltold seem as nothing to them, but it was nMso^rco most of them tho. hours^appeared of .doubleU�tigth while they waited for morning so near>� fcu�re upon, which they could not land. 

 Vl'wo of the female passengers sat .'together on the.^bulwarks, � to which; they had climbed, and were straining their eyes to try-and' make out what sort'of country this land, which .was to be their new thorne was. The sun had set. away behind'Williamstown, but the red glow was still there,' 'and^lay like a shadow of: blood on the placid, waters of ourbay. ? . 

 ,'t' Sp'sitj h�si come' to an end at last," said tho elderrof-;the two women, "and now:there are only aijfew i boura between you and your idol, oh, Bridget fl . 

 '^God forbid Tshould make an idol of anyone," ejaculated 'the young girl fervently, " sure, ftis no}harnv to loyp me own husband." ;.v ^ ' - 

 *�.Yqur, � own husband/' tho other, returned with a� ^sneeiv " aro you so sure of him, Bridget M&ermbt?" - ' . 

 � �fiSure�of �hiin ! ls it.Michael you .are talking of K 'You don't understand, Miss Webster--"* � 

 ?f' My ' name is Jane-don't Miss me," the other interrupted shortly. - , ' 

 v"W.ell,-~ Jane, then-of course, I'm. sure ' of M�ol�aelr^Tam n't I married to him P,J. . ? 

 ,v''i{;Yo�^are so innocent, my poor, child," mur mured'Jane'Webster, t half to herself, -f'and it seems, a pity to try and disturb your confidence in.�a -man from whom you have been.parted for three years* ? Does it ; never� striko you tliat he jmay.'hav� 'met some one he liked better than you since;y0uBaw; him last P" ' ', 

 ? iJake better than mo ? Mo, his wife !, D.ear Jane;'how. can you talk like that ?" . And as if to assure;� herself that she did not share in the - treasonable tf ears of. her companion* tho; honest young/'Irish wife' drew a locket from hexv bosom and kissed ifc.' . ' - s > ' 

 ' There !'-What do you call that ,b'ut-worship, Bridget M'Berinot, mumbling over the,'ploture of a man's face like a simpleton as you aro? -' Let'me tell you, now'tbat we part so soon, that I was once as big a fool about a man as you, and-and, hedeceived me." .' 

 . - Maybe he. wasn't your husband, Jane ?" the young-wife said in a lowvvoice. . 

 -.; " He ..was my husband, as fast : as ever the mhust e r who christened us could make him,' and he ' deserted uie'for another woman.1 Is it any wonder that]I have no faith inman?". . ...-'..<..-. . 

 " No, perhaps . not j but you must not judge Michael? by the bad man who behaved wrong to you/Jane.*1 Michael is not like him."': , 

 ' V�-t�e- is like hhn. It. was his extraordinary likeness to my villain which made nie doubt, him.. Oh, don't look so, frightened, you foolish ;child:, I auj.npb'going to put in a claim to your precious man. : Mine would b� 12 or 14- years older than Michael M'Dermot. No, tho likoness is in the evil look of his eyes, the low formation of his forehead, the cruel shape of his mouth,, the brutal squareness of his jaws, See-'.' And she drew the locket from Bridget's now. trembling fingers and opened it to point at the pictured face-, " could anything but the folly of a woman's love see anything but evil in that face ?" 

 "Ho is my'.husband, and I love hiin dearly," was the gentle reply as Bridget recoyered her treasure and hid it in her breast. , �." I am not -learned like you, Jane, and I - can't speak grand words, but ! feel all the same and I trust Michael. God didn't, make eVery one handsome,'and I. never thought Michael a beauty, but I know he loves me. Wre AV ere poor when we married, and he would have brought me with him if we had the, money. Now he has sent for me thank God, and' we will part no more.' ', ' / 

 " He has sent for you? Yes, when you had money to give him! �Was there any word of sending for you until you told him of your uncle's legacy? Why, he did not even let you know where ho was, and you. had to advertise for his address You told me , all this yourself, Bridget , you know you did." 

 " Yes, Jane, I'did; but liow can you draw bad out of that? If Michael was.so poor all along that he couldn't send the money for mo, why wouldn't he be giad to have me come when I had the money myself ?" ' .: . - 

 <r" I know; child, that I am too ready to look at the evil side of everything-I ,know it well," Jane Webster said repeatedly, as she stooped to kiss the;honest rosy young face beside her ,. "but I have liked and trusted you more than I have done any one of -my kind since evil days foll upon me, and I tremble for your happiness. May. God have you in his keeping, my good and gentle Bridget." 

 " And you too, dear Jane. - But don't be afraid for me-if you knew how happy I am! lt seems to me that! amjlreamihgwhen I think that in a few hours I'll'soe my husband once more ! Oh, if my.'little baby had lived, wouldn't this have been the happy;day!" . . .... i. 

 " Heaven grant you happiness, child. I start for my sister's by rail to-morrow, and if you write to me at tho poBfc-officp, Birra, I will get your lotter;, jind answer-it. j 'You r don't know whore your husband's place istypt, Bridget ?" 

 , ,V;N(T} -but please God X will know to-morrow." 

 t '/ ViOU will write then; and now lot us '�o to bed.and try to rest. Kiss mo good-bye, my child ; in-the'hurry of disombarking wo may not havo �n�tbW opportunity." ? " 

 \\ ThePtwo, women embraced for tho last time, and woilt below ; nor did they nieofc again, for when afc un.early hour Jane'Webstor hurried on duck, the boat -r�hich Miohael M'Dormot had Bent for his wifo was being vowed away. Not once did tho happy and excited girl look back to wavo hor hand to her_Jate shipmates, for. Bho was . gazing eagerly onward toward tho landing-placo, whoro a man's 

 figuro was visible, standing and watching the approaching boat. ."",:V' v 

 The happiest ' woman , in-the whole wide world was Bridget M'Dermot. as the evening of that I same day was drawing "on and she sat beside her husband in the trap he told her he had borrowed to meet her in town'. Her rather ordinary face was nearly beautiful with the light of love in her eyes, and the smile of happiness on her lips. She sat close to Michael's side, holding his arm so lovingly with both clasping hands, and looking into his face ever and anon to read his thoughts there as she fondly hoped. . 

 But M'Dermot's face, was not one so easily to be read as poor Bridget fondly believed. He was a powerful .young \\feUow of seven or eight and twenty, with a low.. brow and deep set oyes too near his small; thin nose.. All the lower part of his face was covered, by a heavy sandy-hued beard, and his hair was coarse and of the lightest shade of bro wn. The hands with which he urged the fine horso he drove were strong and knotted in the joi�t�, and his feet, .though with a good pair of boots on thom, looked huge and ill shapen. If there had been anyone-to-see they inust have wondered at tho choice, the young Irioh girl had made, for his face had a natural scowl imprinted on it, while hers wore tho sweetness and light of a summer sunbeam. '?'.* , ; 

 But.th.ere was no oho- toVsee, and no one to hear the happy prattle of the young wife, nor in truth did Michael M'Dermot seem to enjoy it much. ;7, ? , .. . 

 " You are greatly changed . Michael, darliu'", she said to him as they entered ' a bit of bush through �vhioh their rough road led them, "you used to be so full of fun and now 1,can hardly get a word out of you." . . 

 "I've had hardtimes of it since, I left the ould 

 world, Bridget." ., V'/, ' 

 "Yes, darliu", I know.\\'*'But don't call me Bridget, Michael astbore-you U3ed always call mo 'Bride' or 'Bridie,' and no one has even oalled me Bride once.*"-""-,: ' 

 " We are childer no longep/Bride." 

 " No,'Michael, we are'better ; wo aro loving 

 man and wife for overhand for ever.", 

 v She turned to look .^up . into; his face aa she 

 uttered tho fond words' and'<'wondered. Was it the shadow of the great/strange trees that made him'-look so dark' ? Was1 it'the chill of the words 

 that made his arm' tremble under, her loving 

 hands? j' 

 " Are you cold, Michael, asthoro ? " - ! , 

 " It is chilly here^in the damp bush," he said? shortly. . , \\ .. 

 " Ai^d it is lovely, too, isn't it ? The road,! mean. We<haveh'tmet a^soul since we left that bridge. We, have- come''a..v"good, bit now, 

 Miohael?" . ' " - ,,t 

 "About twenty miles, Bridie." 

 " Will you go much farther? " , 

 . " Noi I think we'llc�mp down, by the- creek liii's about a mile from this'; I don't want to over drive my neighbor's horse j and he'll go fresh home if he gets a good spell to-night, lt will be something1*new.for you� to camn out in the bush; Bridie." . . -4, ,:; , . . 

 "It'll bo splendid !'and'with yoii'i dariing. Oh, I'm too happy, too hapjjy, Michael ! If only we had our baby alive.! " y 

 ' M'Dermot set his teetli/'and ground an' oath 

 between them as he turned the horse's head into the bush. . It was like a grand gentleman's park that was �ear her Irish home, this Australian bush, to poor Bridget,'and her expressions of admiration of tho forn�' and grasses they soon found- themselves among, by tho half-hidden creek side, were unbounded., lt was such delight to bound from the Vehicle land' help Michael to unharness the horse, and to gather sticks accord ing to hi 3 instructions, while he led the animal to tho water. That Bride .was a very girl again, with a heaven she had. only dreamed. of, around her upon earth. . ? > v - . . . 

 "You have forgotten nothing, darling?" she cried, as the bush fire biased up against the log, and tho billy was hung over to boil, while Michael produced from a "tucker box" materials fora 

 j meal, which promised, to the poor unsophisticated 

 girl, a perfect banquet. ., 

 I The supper was eaten �nd apparently enjoyed i by both, and as the obscurity of night crept deeper 

 into the bush1 the logs blazed up merrily, illumi nated with great torigues of name the weird looking trees around ' them and'patches of the deep creek among the tall reeds and bordering 

 ferns. . 1 > 

 .They had talked of ;homo and the neighbors of old days j of the unole in America who so unex pectedly remembered ,the sister's child he had never seen. The notes which represented Bridget's little fortune now .lay. snugly in M'Dermot's pocketbook, for it had been their first object when the young wife landed to. presents her draft at the bank and get it cashed.'-. >;???' ? 

 " We will put it ia our own bank above," Michael had said, " and in your own name, Bridie; so you can lend mo a couple o'pounds when I'm hard up!" . ; 

 And she had laughed merrily, saying it was all his, and*she wantpoVno name to itbutMichael's. 

 "And now my1 Bridie-mustv.be tired/and1 I'll show you how we camp eiit ih th� bdsh. - ' Put the things away in the box, asthore, while I spread the tarpaulinover the cart'.'" 

 That was poor Bride's, flrut initiation into the mysteries of'bush:.-life, and her last ! While M'Dermot went to bring 'iri the .horse to whore he ?had placed "some" -feed,.i or . him, the poor girl arranged'the blankets-he had bought with her own money into a rough but comfortable bed, and when he came baok he . looked under the tarpaulin and saw that she wad'nslpepi 

 Ho did not seem surprised, nor did ho seem to fear awakening heiyfor* ho made a good deal of noiso in dragging, big lumps of timber to pile on tho already great'uro .which was blabing up against tho logs. iPerhapB ho was afraid of thc night dew for his young, wife, though tho cart, with the drooping 'tarpa�ulin over it, was at a considerable distance from,tho fire, or perhaps he felt tho loneliness of tho'deep bush now that his livoly companion was asleep, and there was a'sort of comfort in thc vicinity of a crackling fire. 

 What sort of fuc� had Michael M'Dcrinofc on 

 triia �the first night of having . his � young and innocent wife hy his side in this new land? <-iA. face which, never at any time prepossessing, had now the darkness of death in it. He Fat on a log beyond the shrouded cart, with his pipe in his' unheeding lips, until it roused him from his hel lish thoughts hy dropping to the ground' and hiding itself among the grass, wher� it remained unsought. The moon was rising red and round beyond the creek, and he Btared as if fascinated i by the blood-red orb. "Was he thinking of the deed hor light should shine on ere long, or seeing in her awful hue the shadow of his approaching 

 crime ? . 

 I It was a night so perfectly still that' behind I him, in the shadows into'which we dared not 

 t peor, the wretched being fancied ho could hear a | 

 snake rustling among the grass j and, indeed, it might be so, for some little bell-birds, which were nestling on tho branches far above his head, twittered uneasily as if half-conscious < of an enemy's presence. A blood-red mist blinded the man for a moment, and there was such a strange pang' in the region of his heart' that'his hand went suddenly to the spot and he felt Bridget's 

 roll of notes. 

 The very touch of them seemed to recover ? the villain, and he rose to his feet. Moviog cautiously now down to the border of the creekyhe' pulled back a handful of the tall rushes and peered into the silent water j then he 'shook himself, as if its chill had touched him, and returned to'tho fire. 1 ? . ':' ? "... ' . 

 The wood had burned fiercely, and there was now a great glow of embers, such as might be made for the smelting of ore. Tho man seemed to-hesitate ; but at last he decided, and, stooping over the'box he had left ready by the wheel'of the cart, he drew from it a new and heavy tomahawk, which he "hefted anxiously as though fearing it was-'too light. . ' ' , ' 

 : What was he going to do with that tomah�wk that he stooped and so cautiously drew up the tarpaulin? ' Was it to let the moonlight fall on the girl's sleeping face that he did that? Bridget was lying in a peaceful sleep, fully dressed, and with a happy smile round the red lips, through which the regular breath came so" softly, and her fingers were' clasped round the locket that con tained the portrait of her idol. Ah Bleeper, awake ! if it is not even nowtoo late.. The image you have bowed your young heart and soul to is 'not'the gold you deemed it,-but tho foulest dross 

 of hell! 

 ' As' the.moonrays fell upon the peaceful1 face of the trusting girl- wife, the rays ' al se 'glittered on ?the chain of tho locket she held �ear her lips. '.. It was the first time he had noticed it, and laying the weapon down beside him, he knelt oh the grassl and gently as his rough hands could disen tangled the embossed silver from Bridget's ^re laxed fingers. It was a moro difficult task to un fasten the clasp, but he accomplished it, and gathering-ohain and locket in his hand, he pushed them into his pocket j and then as he seized the weapon in the grip of a murderer, a dark cloud stole over the moon's face, and the reeds down by the creek rustled in a'moaning breeze that sounded sad as - the wail of a mother over the grave''of her firstborn'.
