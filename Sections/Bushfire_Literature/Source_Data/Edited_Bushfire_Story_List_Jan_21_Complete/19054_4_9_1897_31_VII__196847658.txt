 ' CHAPTER VII - 

 The heat of' the- last day of February,-.. 180 � ,. wns greater than any previousl|y-ex/| perienced- since the colony of New South Waltes was founded. The nighlf before had been so hot that- the gentlemen' at Cnrrum- bede had carried (3ieir bedding to the ire- : randahj and had passed tlic night there, getting such -sleep as the mosquitoes per-

There was little real rest for the iadies in the bed rooms that night. As Aliss Almyr had declared that she. must return home. Air. . Summers had; ar ranged to drive her in the buggy; that be ing a much pleasanter way of travelling than riding, under the circumstances. Ac cordingly they had breakfast about . 5' o'clock,, and the horses were harnessed, arid, .ail were ready for a start before 6. By- leaving at that hour- ALiss Aliuyr .would be-, home before the extreme- heat of the day set in. - At the kist moment- Ella said she would like to go Tor tiie drive, and her father allowed her to accompany him. Then, with a few parting injunctions to Charlie, Air. Summers drove off, promising to he back at 10 o'clock, the next day at latest. About 20 yards outside the garden gute grew a small ironhiu-k tree, and Aliss Jane, coining to the verandah about half an hour later, saw Charlie working very hard with, a piet and shovel beneath it. Her nephew had always been a favorite with her;: she frequently declared that he Was 1 "a real S'mmnei-s" � Ella she regarded as taking after her mother's family. She took an interest in anything that the young fel low did, and accordingly went- out to see what he was doing. Air. Leasing, who had come out to gather some grapes before mak ing himself comfortable for tbe rest of the day, joined her. "Whatever are you doing, Charlie, over heating yourself a day like this?" Alias. Jane asked. "Only digging it- grave for Scamp, auntv."" "A grave- for Scamp?" "Yes, lie died Inst night. Atr. Hope shot him tbieu or t'uur days ago." . "Why did Air:. Hope shoot your dog?" Air. Lessing inquired. "In England people do not kill their friends' animals." 

 "They don't. out here cither, if they have any decency. However, I won't forget this to Hope in a hurry. I am making the grave, too, where he will have to pass it every time he cofues to- the house." "You seem to have quarrelled with your friend?" Afr. Lessing said. . "A pretty friend," Charlie muttered. "The dog was worth a dozen. of such friends." Mr, Lessing had- evidently ascertained ali he "wished to know. Fnr i-iivnltn, ),v Vr:.-- 

 Summers, he said, "I am afraid it is unwise of you to stay fn. tiie sua without a Jiat;" and he and she returned to the house. As tltcy went, he remarked: "It is a pity when old friends- disagree; but the provocation in this case is very great." "It is, indeed," Aliss Jane replied; "I think it very mean of. JEr. Hope to do such a thing". - Charlie, left to himself, continued his labor till, he had dug a liole about three feet deep. Then he got the- dead dog, and put- tiug him. in, filled1 in the earth again. Next he procured some green paint, and on the black, rough bark printed the one word, "SCAMP1." The interment over- he cot on 

 his horse, and had a look at some of the fences in the home paddocks, and did not appear again till it was nearly lunch time. Then he came galloping into the yard, rushed' to the Iiouse and got his double barrelled breechloader, rushed out again, jumped on bis horse, and went off as quickly as it could lay its legs/to the ground. A few minutes later, there was a report of n. shot, and presently lie came home again in an easy canter. At lunch he explained that Iris attention. lmd been attracted by a pair of soldier birds malting: a great noise in a tree,; and on. going to see what they were aliaut he had' found that an iguana wns eating the'yonng ones out of their nest. He threw a stick or two at it, and succeeded in driving it further up the tree; tlfen, with out giving it time to resume its menl, ho had got the gun and shot it, and relieved 

 the birds of its presence. "The nasty beast/' Aunt -Jane said; "I wonder was it the same one as ate the grey hen's clutch of 'eggs two days before the chickens were to come out." And then the lady proceeded to tell of the artfulness of crows, which would watch the hens going to their nests, and as soon as they came off would fly doivn and steal the eggs, before she could run out and get them. One trouMe suggested another, and the. lady went on to remark, "I would not' bo one bit astonished if your father met with an accident to-day; those buggy horses can see over their winkers easily. The . hist time I went for a drive Caliph was looking behind hirii the whole time. I. was certain tbey would bolt, arid as soon as I got home 

 I said I would not go into the buggy again till the horses-got a new pair of winkers." : "Oh, well aunty; Nixon should have been here last niglit, and will probably turn up to-day some time; and I wilT see-' that he makes two. pairs first thing." "I shall he very glad when bo comes/ Miss Summers said. Poor lady, little did she dream what his waggon would contain S ,UI Victorian rights la thb story hare been purchased bp tli� proprietors of "-The Leader," 

 v ,teiuiion yard that evcn" ' inThcn for Mr. Lcssing's benefit, Clmrlic ' pxnlainod tlmt Nixon was a Kaudewar snd TJ' wj10 once in six months' came to Cur- ruiubctlo and ihe neighboring stations, and spent about a fortnight at each of them making and repairing harness. Lunch was barely over when the servant came in to say that Billy wanted to see Mr. Summers. Charlie went to see him, and re turned in a very short time with the bad news that a bush fire had started. "All the .men except Billy and' myself are away. . Don't wait dinner for me, aunty, if I ana late," he said. He was rushing out again .when Mr. Leasing said) " If . I would not .be very much in your way, I would like to ac- i- /company you. - I have heard a great deal , . about these bush fires, and I wish very much to see one." "Alb right," Charlie said. "I will run the ; night horse in for you. Take my advice and ' leave your coat at horiie;; it will be fearfully ." hot." ' -- "Thanks," Mr. Leasing replied, ."I shall"; and retired to his room, where he spent about a quarter of an hour getting ready v for his ride. When lie came to the station yard he found his horse saddled, and Charlie and Billy waiting for him. Then, all mount ing, they set off at a quick canter in the direction of the smoke. - . "Where do you think it is?'? Mr. Lessmg asked. . . - - _ f'Probablvfive or six miles away, Charlie answered; "but it is impossible to say. No thing is so hard to locate as a fire. You see a. smoke that you judge to.be four miles off, . and you ride double that distance, and it ap- ' pears to be as far away as ever." , "I'll bet you a new hat," Billy interposed, "that this one is not more than six.". "It's not good- enough, Billy," Charlie an swered laughing. "\\ou are too much of a judge for me to gamble with you. . It's a lucky thing there are no sheen in the pad- dopk; we took the hoggets out last week." "Yes, we would have had a picnic driving tliem to-day," Billy- said. . Presently they came to the edge of the fire, and this is the half-caste's statement of what subsequently happened: � "There was a strong north wind blowing most of the time, and whenever it blew in earnest the fire would travel like billy-oh. On the left side it had got on the plain, but was not making much headway, -and was likely to go out of its- own accord there when it reached the Nandewar-road. In front, where we were, it was raging through the long dry grass of the ring-narked coun try. About a mile to our right there was a top rail - fence. -Master Charles said, if I stayed where I was and did what I could, he would ride on and have a look, at the fence, and then work his way back to me. He said to Mr. Lessing, '\\ou can either come with me or stay with Billy. If you do the latter, you will be " able to get a drink now and then, as he has a water bag on his saddle, and I haven't.' Mr. . Lessing said lie thought he would stay with me, and Master Charles rode off. Tlmt was the last time I snw him alive. When he was gone we took our horses and tied them in the shade of a wilga; and, getting : two good box suckers, we went back and started belting out the fire. . We had been at that mime, no time when Mr. Lessing said: 'This neat" - is dreadful,' and off the old josser cleared . to sit in the shade. By-and-bye lie came back and did another stroke or two, and then he said: "The lieat is terrific. We will be fortunate if some of us do not get sun stroke'; and then off he went again. This time I went with him and had a drink, as I was getting baked; and then I left him bo- side the horses, and had another go at the fire. I worked hard in the smoke and the beat: and perhaps about an hour had passed from the time Master Charles left us, and Mr. Lessing was back working real hard beside ine, when I heard a coocy. "Master Charles is cooeying for us,' I said. 'We had better see what he wants'; and off we started, following the edge of the fire. I went quickly, for every minute there was a fresh cooey, and I reckoned that something must .be wrong. We had hurried along for about .quarter of a mile, when for a minute the -wind changed and blew the smoke back across the burnt ground; and there in front of us, under a Seen bibbel, nil at once, we saw Mr. Hope. e was just rising from something he was bending over when he snw us; and then he shouted: 'Have you got any water. Billy? ' Come quick.' When we, got to him, there at the foot of the tree, MaBter Charles lay dead." This is Keith Hope's account of how he passed the same afternoon. He. said to me, You must understand, Anthony, that -in a hot, dry summer a pastoralist lives in constant dread of fires. Not only may he lose miles of '.fencing; but when one starts you never know where it will stop; and on such a day as that last of Fcbruary half the run may be burned before you know where you are. To put it in other words, in 21 hours you may lose what grass would have kept half of your sheen in good condition for three months. I think even a town man can understand that this is a Very serious loss. And just at the time when the grass is likeliest to burn, it possesses nn extra value, as we do not know when we shall get any more to replace it. .There is little growth when the heavens are like brass nnd the' earth is like iron. You can judge, therefore, with what anxiety we watch for a fire . .starting, and how when we see the smoke . . we will ride for miles to get it out while ' it is still manageable. "About 1 o'clock that last day of Feb ruary, p saw a Bmoke which appeared to ' rise somewhere near the boundary. I got - my horse and went to have a look at the fire, and was glad to find it had not reached my land. It was burning in one of the Cur- rumbedc paddocks. I went on to see if I could be of any use, as neighbors always help each other in a ense of that kind. - "My quarrel with Charlie the evening be"- ' fore was a private matter, and I did not in- : tend to let it get mixed up with station work. After a little. I reached the edge of .- tho fire, and had ridden along it for a short distance when T. saw Charlie Summers's - horse saddled and bridled, feeding about 200 yards from the. edge. Poor Charlie lmd all . his horses so trained that he could let them go anywhere and catch them again when he wanted. Seeing the horse, I knew , . he could not be far away, and set about looking for him. 'You already know how I found him." ' . Now, at laBt, I havo brought my narra tive to tho date of Charles Summers'B 

 I death, and can henceforth proceed, relating the events as they happened without any further retrogression. As soon-as Nixon, the saddler, had got the i bodviuhiswaggon.he lost no lime in setting out'for the station. He was a good-natured and feeling man in the main, nevertheless he i inly resolved that every inch of leather that came in contact with the dead body would be used on the Currumbcdc harness. Not a scrap of it would he lake to any other station: much less cany- home with him. Mr. Lessing and Billy rode together a little behind the wnggon. Billy was much ! excited nnd somewhat frightened. The wild superstitions nature he inherited from a long-line of dusky ancestors was perturbed; nor did it appear that his Chinese father had -endowed his offspring with any of the Oriental phlegm. The' eyes in his dark face I were bulging, 'and seemed to be nearly all I whites. Sir. Lessing, on the contrary, seemed- the same as ever.. Whatever Ins- thoughts were, tho mask-like, face did not reveal them. He was as taciturn as evor,� only, breaking the silence twice� once by remarking, "It was curious, your finding Mr. Hope's whip beside Master Charles ; and the second time by saying, "Doesn't Air. Hope appear to be hurrying. on . the funeral? Is such haste really required? When they reached the home paddock, Mr. Lessing said lie would rido on aiid prc- ; pare Miss Summers for what bad happened; and left -Billy and Nixon to follow at a slower pnee. . . . Miss Jane was in the. sitlingroom. when he arrived. "My dear Miss Summers, I am tlie-bearer of very bad news." ' "Something has happened to Charlie, ' she exclaimed. : The poor lady put her hand to her heart nklf Blie would faint, nnd sinking on a clinir, aBked in a dry tongucd voice, "Has he been thrown froinfiis horse?".- ' "No. The sun." "Ah." The sound was something between an exclamation and a sob. "The poor fellow has had a sunstroke, and I fear lie will-not recover." "Ho is dead." "Yes, Miss Summers, it would be cruel to prolong your agony. I can hear the wheels of the waggon at the gate. He is dead." Then he left her, and went to'hclp 'Nixon and Billy to bear Charlie's body to his bed room. \\ While they stood at the bed, Miss Jane entered, and, with a cry of 0, Charlie, Charlie," flung her arms round liiB neck, and went as if her heart would break. . Nixon wiped the perspiration from his fat sallow-face with the sleeve of his coat, and alter a minute's thought, he said, "The best thing I can do is to drive back to town. Jason, tlie carpenter, was sober when I left to-day, and if lie work all night, I shall be able to be back by sunrise to-morrow with the" � - box. Come along) Bill, and give me a hand to get the things out of the wag gon," nnd the two men left the room. Whan they were gone, Mi-. Lessing said, "I will not attempt to console you, Miss Summers, but- 1 am anxious "to help you. If you will go to your room and take the rest tlmt your nerves require, I .will do any thing that is needed to prepare iioor Charles for -his burial." "Oli, no, no, Mr. Lessing. I would not let anyone touch him except myself. Please go away and leave us." Without saying anything more he obeyed ber. Two hours later Miss Summers came to "him. "There is one thing you could do for me, Mr. Lessing. ' I would like -to have Charlie shaved. He did not shave this morning. I do not know how to do it." . "Certninly,AlissSummers;if you getsoine hot water I will do it for you," Mr. Lessing answered; and getting a razor and the water they went together to the room. " It was now dusk, nnd a candle was burn ing at: tho head of the bed. "The clothes which the dead man liad ' worn at the fire had bcen changed for white linen; the sheet came. up to his breast, and his arms lay by his side. Ho had been washed, and every trace of blackness got by working at the fire had been removed. Miss Jane put .a towel round Ills neck to save the sliirt and white silk tie in .which she had dressed him, arid), taking'the candle, held it so as to give Ebb-, sing the best light for his work. In a few minutes one side of the dcadfacewas covered with lather, and Lessing, taking -up the razor, was about to use it, when, all at once, the ghasllinbss of the office seemed to' strike him. A fit of trembling took hold of him," his hand shaking, so that for more than a minute he could not prooeed with 

 His task. xiiGic. seemeu to be somotning awful, something grotesquely horrible,' about the white face, with the foam covering one cheek. Then, with a great effort, ho re covered his nerve, and as quickly as possible finished what he had to do. As soon as he was done. Miss Jane sponged and dried the dead man's face, and removed the towel from his breast. "Poor boy, my -poor boy," she snid, "is he not beautiful? When I was brushing his liair I found a little bruise here, on his right temple. I supppose he must have got it when he fell." "Yes," Air. Lessing replied, " or he may have received it after his death, when we placed him in tho waggon, or on the way homo; the road, is uneven in'placoB. Where will he be interred. Miss Summers?" "His mother is buried in the Nandewnr Cemetery: I expect that my brother will bury him beside her." Here Miss Jane, who had restrained her grief while there was work to be done, broke down again. "1'ardon niv troubling you. Miss Summers, but as your brother is not here, should we not send a messenger to the town with in structions for the grave to bo got readv? 1 confess I forgot about the necessity of this till after Nixon had gone." . Poor Miss Jane dried her eyes again, and said, "Yes, I must sec to it." . "If you allow me, I will go and find Billy, and toil him what is required of him, mid you can write a short note to the proper persoiiB in the township, and he can start .with it nt once. I am sorry tlmt, being a stranger, I cannot attend to the matter my self, and save you all the trouble." "Thank you, Air. Lessing, I will go and write the note at once." . In another hour, in the starlit night, tho half caste was riding with the letter which would ensure that by daylight the next morning men would be busy opening' the burying place of the Summers family. Now, all this time-Keith Hope' had been' flushing on at the top of his horse's speed o reach Almyr's. As it was, the surihnd been set some time, and the only- light wns that of tho stars when he arrived there. The servant who, showed him into tho drawingroom told him that tho family was still at dinner, and went with his message that he wished to see Mr. Summers at once. 

 While slio was going Keith could lien; _ a peal of merriment coming from the uming- l-ooni, in which lie could easily distinguish Mr. Summers's jovial laugh, nnd n'ltli a lover's imagination he fancied lie could also detect that of Ella. The sound wrung his heart. Why had fate ordained that lie. who loved her as no one else in the world could, should bo the one to deliver to her such heavy tidings as those lie uore. tins feeling was so expressed on his face that when Mr. Summers entered a moment Inter, nnd looked nt liim, the joke he was about to make died on Ins-tongue, and he said at once in an anxious voice: � ,ru "Nothing wrong, is there, Hope ! "Yes, Air. Summers. I nin the bearer of very bad news. .. Charlie has got sun stroke." , "Is he ill?" '"He "is dead." Keith never eared to talk about this scene. He told me once that the 10 minutes that followed were the worst ever lie spent in his life. Mr. Summers seemed to bo stunned. He sat down oil a chair, and stared straight in front of linn with vacant eyes. At Inst, to rouse liini, Keith said � " Had we not better let Miss Almyr knpw, and get her to tell Ella?" Air. Summers did not appear to hear liim. Keith went to the door and called, " Miss Almyr, inny I see you, please, for a minute?" . . , With the quick intuition wlneli so mnny women possess, Ella guessed that there was something wrong, and came with her friend. As soon as she saw Air. Summers, she said, "Oh, I know something terrible lias hap pened. Tell me wlint it is, father. air. Summers looked at her for a moment with dull eyes, as if he did not recognise lira, and then turned his face away again. He did not speak. , For a minute they remained so, the man sitting staring vacantly, and the beautiful girl standing beside .nun, her largo blue eyes dilated with terror at some unknown calamity; and then Keith could not bear to see her suffer so any longer. He crossed the room, and very gently took her hand. "Ella, dearest, ber brave," lie said; and then, by a happy inspiration, lie added, Be brave' for your father's sake." The poor girl made an effort to calm her- 

 self; but did not speak. "It has been dreadfully hot to-day, Ella, and there has been a bush lira on Curruni- bede. Charlie went to put it out, and be worked too hard." Keith paused. The girl was listening at tentively. Tho little liaud ho held grew firm, as if every muscle were being braced to meet the coming shock. "Owing to tho heat lie took very ill? Again lie paused. How could he bring himself to say the awful word he wns ap proaching. He hesitated so long that Ella looked in his face, and then looked, at lier father, and she knew the truth. Keith and she were standing close together. She snid nothing, asked for no detnils; but, ns natu rally as if Hope had been her accepted lover for years she drew closer to him, and, rest ing her head on his shoulder, cried as if her heart would break. Keith stood with his arms round the weeping jgirl, nnd for a time did not try to comfort her. He felt that the tears she was shedding were easing her heart, nnd that silent sympathy was the best thine he could give her. Ho was more than half ashamed at sucli a moment the thought of his own good fortune should obtrude itself. The crisis had made Ella know her own lienrt. She loved him. The woman who wns all the world, and all his life to him, was his at last. r-': - - . Arertriwhile; Miss Almyr had slipped quietly from ;tke room to tell her fnthcr of Charlie Summers's death. Half an hour laler, when he come to the drawingroom, lie found Ella sitting beside Keith, listening to all he could tell her about her brother. Mr. Summers had not changed his position. Mr. Almyr went up to him, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said, "I am awfully sorry for you, old man." The touch seemed to bring him to himself.' Air. Almyr took him hack to the dining- room, and poured -out a glass of whisky for him, which he drank at once. "I must go home now. Can you let the man run up the buggy horses lie .asked"- , 3'% JfriPbeSflJtfir 'tfijj'itfor driving through the busli," Mr." "Almyr said! "Would it not do if you started first thing in the morning?" - "No, I must go at once. Tell Ella to got ready." Gerty took her father' on one side.- "It would be a shame to let Ella venture out at this hour of the night. There is no moon. 

 Let one of the men ride with Air. Summers, nnd Air. Hope can drive Ella to Currum- bede early to-morrow morning." Mr._ Almyr readily saw the common sense of this proposal, and easily persuaded Air. bummers, whose one idea wns to get home to his dead son, to accede to it. I will not delay to describe Air. Sum mers s ride through the darkness, nor linr- row your feelings with the account of his grief, ns he spent what remained of the night beside the .bed on which Charlie lay for the last time. Very early in the morn ing A ixon drove into the yard with the coffin, and without any loss of time the body was placed in it, and the funeral shortly afterwards started for Nandewur.
