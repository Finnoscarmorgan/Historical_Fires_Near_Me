 The police would often make inquiries of me as to what travellers I had met or seen on the road. When they did so I would give a description of any of those I had encountered, with any information I had received as to whence they had come and 

 whither they were going. The settlers on the river were not allowed to ferry across   any travellers on penalty of forfeiting their tenure licenses. Thus travellers were   obliged to avail themselves of the Govern- ment punt at Wellington. If any man was reported to the police as being on the road, two of them would cross on the punt and then separate, one going up the river, the other down. In this way they could not fail to pick up the trail of anyone who had been near the water, the sandy nature of the country around making the impress of footsteps, in any place that received some of the moisture from the river, peculiarly plain. There were no steamers plying on the Murray at that time, so there was no escape for fugitives from   justice.         While I was acting as mailman two stockmen and their employer crossed by the punt with a mob of cattle from the Corong for the Adelaide markets. After the mob had been sold only one stockman returned. Suspicion was aroused against him in consequence of nothing being seen of the master and the other stockman, who were expected to follow, and, as it was known that the suspected man had taken the road to Mount Gambier, the police determined to follow him up. On my return journey on this occasion Sergeant Cusick, stationed at Wellington, and a mounted trooper joined me. The former gave me instructions as to how to act on coming up with the fugi- tive stockman. It was expected we should overtake him about McGrath's Flats; the general camping ground.   On my arrival there I saw the sergeant's surmise was correct; our man was camped   at the caboose. I left the police a little behind, so that they were out of sight, and camped there too. After my horses were secure for the night, I put my billy on the fire and began to talk. Presently the trooper, who was in plain clothes, rode up, asked whether he could stay for the night, and, tethering his horse, sat down so that the stockman was between us. We had just begun our supper quite comfortably when the sergeant rode up in full uniform and hastily dismounted. So great was the shock to the stockman that the fish he had just put in his mouth dropped to the ground. He was asked where he came from last, and said Adelaide. The ser- geant then questioned him: "Didn't you     help in droving a mob of cattle through some time back?" "Where's your mate?"         He replied that he had had nothing to do with any cattle, and knew nothing of any mate. After some more equally unsatisfactory answers the sergeant said:   "I arrest you for the murder of your     master." We had a tough struggle for it;   but we succeeded in handcuffing him, and then found concealed about his clothing in notes and gold between two and three hundred pounds. The cash was handed to me while the prisoner was still struggling to break from the two constables, as he more than once momentarily succeeded in doing. At last he was securely bound on   his own horse and led away, whilst I pursued my journey. It transpired after- ward that he had murdered his master and thrown the body into the river; but of his   mate I never heard anything. The mur- derer was, I believe, tried at Adelaide, found guilty, and executed. CHAPTER VII.�WAR AGAINST AND WITH   THE BLACKS. At this time there was no station within twenty miles of McGrath's Flats and the blacks were nearly as numerous as sheep on a run;   surrounding the Flats on all sides from the Murray to the Corong. I escaped all trouble with them on my various journeys, except on one occasion. Once, when riding near She Oak Wells, a blackfellow treacherously hurled two spears at me, I instantly let the packhorse go and turned and followed him up till within shooting range. I then levelled my carbine, took good aim, and fired. He bounded like a kangaroo and fell   backward on the ground. I did not stay to see whether he was dead or alive; but   only stopped to catch my packhorse again, after doing which I rode on to Wellington, where I reported what I had done. As there was no enquiry made I heard no more of that blackfellow.   Pushing on after this shooting affair I reached McGrath's Flats that day, and wit- nessed another encounter between two tribes�the McGraths and the Tatiaras.     Seeing that the McGraths had nearly con- quered I put on an appearance of great courage, and, seizing a nullah-nullah and wooden shield, joined the stronger party. I found a place near one of the chiefs, and, rushing forward, leathered away with   might and main. My opponents' heads when they received sound whacks would seem to ring out like iron pots when sub- jected to the same treatment, and the weapon would sometimes actually bounce off. In   the onslaught I must have disabled a   score of the enemy when I felt a tremendous thud on the back of my neck and tumbled over like a ninepin. I lay uncon- 

 scious till after dark. On coming round I found myself hampered by the lifeless body of a black lying across my chest. I   pushed him off, and stole away to the mi- mi. There was no one there. My gin cook had doubtless been carried off by the Tatiaras. Satisfied with my warlike deeds, I soon went to bed and to sleep. Early in the morning I visited the chief and told him that the lubra he had given us as an attendant on the mailman had disappeared. He replied in his broken English: "Tatiara     fellows man him, lookem out another one fellow lubra, and you man him." I went round among the mi-mis, and found several new ones, fresh and young prisoners of war, captured from the   other tribe. Among them was a half caste. I went up to her and said, "Me man   him you. You come along me." I took her to the chief who said, raising his hand authoritatively. "That one coolie belong   em you. You pull away." As she seemed not unwilling to be thus disposed of, the chief, barbarian fashion, knocked her off her pins by a not too gentle tap on her "cobra." I left her lying half insensible   as the chief said to me, "By bye you come   back him all right." After this little ceremony I started again for Wellington. CHAPTER VIII.�A STRANGE MURDER   TRIAL.     By this time, my purse being pretty well lined, I grew tired of my occupation and wanted change. I spoke to the man who drove the mail from Adelaide, and told him I wanted to see Mr. Chambers, the contractor, and throw up my billet. The driver and I accordingly exchanged positions, he taking the Mount Gambier mails and I going on to Adelaide, by way of Langhorne's Creek and Mount Barker. On arriving in Adelaide I told Mr. Chambers of my wishes, saying that the continuous riding through the short stumps of ti-tree and salt bush, and the heavy sands, had so shaken me that I must have a change, but that, when I felt better, I would return to his employ. To this he assented; and, after we had settled   up, I went to my old inn�the Billy Bar-     low, in Light Square.   Strolling through the town some days   afterward I entered the courthouse, and found that there was then proceeding   the trial of two men called Jakes and Smitherman for the murder of a black gin. I knew the blacks' language and I listened with astonishment to the way the inter- preter was falsifying the evidence of the black witnesses. The case was nearly ended, and, through the treachery of the interpreter, the lives of the two prisoners were in the utmost jeopardy. The truth, as it came out after the trial, was that the half civilised black interpreter had cruelly beaten his gin for keeping company with the two accused. She had died from the effects of this beating, and he then tried to cast the blame on them. One of the prisoners admitted that he had struck the murdered gin, but said he had done her no harm. Because of this ad- mission the counsel for the defence found much difficulty in rebutting the evidence for the Crown. I elbowed my way up to him and told him that the black inter- preter had been playing false. He made effective use of the point in his speech, and, in consequence, the jury brought in a verdict of "not guilty."   During the trial the judge asked me how I came to understand the blacks' language, when I told him of how much I had had to mix with the race when lately employed by Mr. Chambers, the well-known mail contractor. This trial was about 1850. After their release the two men and their wives could not make enough of me. When I had got rid of them I called on my old friend C�� and told him all my ad-   ventures. I had a good time with him and a number of excursions at his expense with the young girl I had known when in Adelaide before. CHAPTER IX.�THE BURRA BURRRA COPPER     MINES.           I next resolved to have a look at the famous Burra Burra copper mines, which were a little over a hundred miles from the city. I consequently proceeded to Gawler, a town situated on a plain of the same name. It was then a very little place, but is now a great farming centre. I was afterward sorry that my visit to the mines was so ill-timed. From Gawler to the Burra, through the Kapunda district, was almost a continuous line of mineral workings. On the day I arrived   on the Burra happened that fearful calamity, the bursting of the waterspout, which inflicted such severe loss on the Cornish miners and others. These miners had their lodgings in caves that they had dug in the banks of the creek at the bottom of the hill on which the mine pro- perty is situated. The insides of these queer cabins, which had their chimneys formed of empty casks sticking up through the main street of the village, were pic- tures of cleanliness and neatness. The sidewalls were as smooth as marble and   carefully whitewashed, and there were cupboards cut in the clay and filled with shining cups and dishes. The sudden bursting of the waterspout near the head of the creek swept everything before it, gutting the cabins. Much cash was lost, as the miners, more especially the Cornish- men, liked to change all the cheques and notes they earned into coin, which they   hid in various parts of their dwellings for safety. These plants were nearly all   swept out, and for days afterwards the men were engaged washing up the dirt from the creek seeking what might be re- covered. A few days after this event which, though few lives were lost, cast a great gloom over the colony, the company had scores upon scores of builders and carpenters at work, many of them brought from Adelaide, and in a short time rows of substantial cottages were built for the storm-evicted families, who, in the meantime, had been sheltered by the hotel-keepers, storekeepers, and many private residents. The principal row of cottages was completed on Sunday, and for this reason was called Sunday Row. Owing to this calamity I had much less opportunity of inspecting the famous mine than I should have wished, and I soon returned to Gawler. (TO BE CONTINUED.)
