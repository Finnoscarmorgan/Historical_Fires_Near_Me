KEITH HOPE,

 CHAPTER XVI. 

 The evening of the second day arter the trial found a party of seven as- sembled in the Currumbcde sitting room. Sandown had come with nie to treat with Mr. Summers for the pur- chase of hie Melbourne property, and Keith had brought Dr. Liston, being naturally anxious respecting the health of a pa�edt whot�* medicine Leasing had. known so much about. Ella wa� sitting between her father and Keith, and Miss Jane was also present. 

 When we four from Pottinger had arrived cady that morning, Dr. Liston had immediately gone to Mr. Sumniei�'s room and examined him. Ile told mo soon afterwards that he could1 not be certain what poison had been adminis- tered, but whatever it was it was a slow one, and enough of it had not been taken to produce any very serious effects. Sir. Summers, although still suffering a little from rheumatism, rose in time for breakfast, and appeared to be much the same as when I la�t saw bim. 

 Ella was in the garden watching for us, and Keith at once went to her. I never expect to see two happier people than they looked lialf-an-hour later, when, hand in hand, they carno up the path. I was on tlie veranda alune at the time, and I noticed that Keith whis- pered something to her, at which she blushed very prettily. 

 " Dear cousin Anthony," she said, " how can I ever thank you for the happiness you have given me ?" She gave rue her soft little hand, and held up her sweet face for me to kiss her. 

 I stooped down and touched her pure white brow with my lips. "Heaven bless you, Ella," I answered, " you have done a hundred times more for me than I have been able to do for you.- You have restored to me the faith and some of the dreams of my youth." 

 " Ella and I have arranged every- thing," Keith said. " Ae soon as Mr. Summers is out of danger we will get marned, and go home to England for a six months' holiday. ' While we are away I want you to live at my place tlie men I have are good, and know their work, and all you will have to do will be to sign the cheques." 

 " Yes, cousin Anthony," Ella Inter- posed, "and you must.promise me now that when we return you will live with us always." And then we all went in 

 to breakfast. 

 When the meal was over, Ella and. Keith disappeared, and I did not sete1 them again till lunch time. I had a lung talk with Mr. Summers, during 

 I which he told me of the will Losing 

 had induced him to make. The poor gentleman also recalled the drive he had had with Leasing before his son's death, and how the conversation had turned on the subject of the risk of death from heat apoplexy when work- ing at a bush fire. He made a promise concerning Sandown, which I was com- missioned to tell him on a suitable oc- casion, f 

 Miss Jane I saw some time later in the dining-room. 

 " I have to congratulate you, Miss Summers," I remarked, " on coming into a fortune. The land in Melbourne j 5s worth between thirty and forty thou- sand pounds, and sis your father made no will your share will be very con- 

 siderable." ' 

 To my surprise, the woman looked 

 miserable. 

 " Don't speak to me of this wretched money, Mr. Rusden. I wish I had burned that fatal paper when I de- stroyed father's letters. But for it Charlie would have been alive to-day. In my own way I loved my nephew and my brother. My nephew Js dead, and though my brother seems to be alive, his heart Is dead and In his son's grave. Even you-forgive me for putting the case so strongly-a man, who seems to have made a failure of his whole life, are loved for your own sake by your cousin and Ella, and that apart alto- gether from the service you have ren- dered them. In this you have suc- ceeded where I have failed, for in all the world not one single human being has an atom of love to spaTe to the lonely woman called Jane Summer�." 

 With the dignity which great unhap piness always lends, the lady rose and left me. I felt sorry for her. Yet 1 knew-the inexorable law of nature 

 that those who let the spring and sum- mer pass without planting a seed will, when autumn comes, have never a flower! 

 And now, as I aaid In the beginning of this chapter, we were all assembled after dinner in the �ltting-rooin. AU were anxious to hear from me the ex- planation of the mystery wbich had 

 surrounded the murder. 

 "To begin at the beginning," I said, " I think Mr. Sandown ia right In his surmise that Lessing knew of Mr. Sum- mers'� Melbourne property when he came to Currumbede. I believe that he came here for the purpose of getting the title-deed into his possession. In this, as we know, he succeeded. He had next to decide how he was going to turn it into money. Remember that he could not go to Melbourne, for fear of being arrested on a charge of embezzle- ment. In this dilemma he hit on a plan which meant the sacrifice of two lives, and very nearly sacrificed three. 

 " First lie gets Mr. Summers to make his will, appointing ulm and Charles executors. Then the bush lire gave bim the opportunity to execute the plan which lie had matured. As I said at the trial, I believe it was no part of his design to fracture Charles's skull. I think he meant to stun him, kill bim with the needle, and theu drag the body back again to the edge of the lire, where it would get scorched and the clothes be burned. In this way every trace of the crime would be destroyed, and it would appear that Charles had succumbed to the heat and fallen where he stood. Tlw 

 unexpected appearance of Keith pre-' vented him from carrying out bis plan to completion. He had Just time to escape, and no more. It is worth while noticing that, although he pointed out to Billy the suspicious circumstances that Keith's whip was found on the ground, and that Keith seemed to wish the body to be buried quickly, yet for at least a month ho mentioned these things to no one else. He knew that had an inquest been held at once, .the injury to the heart would probably have 

 been discovered. 

 " Whether Lessing ever wished to marry Ella or not, I cannot decide. Had he married lier, and then informed Mr. Summers of the land in Melbourne, he could have counted on getting a con- siderable fortune. Again, however, Keitli unconsciously foiled his plans ; the lucky fellow had at last won the prize that be had been trying to gain for years. Lessing's flrst object now was to get Keith out of the way. I am convinced in my own mind that It was lie who furnished tbe information which led lo my cousin's arrest and trial. 

 " Had Keith been convicted, and had Mr. Summers here continued taking his medicine some time longer, Lessing would have been master of the situation. As Ella's agent, acting in her name and through a firm of lawyers, he would have sold the Melbourne property with- out her ever knowing that it belonged to her ; and as soon as he got the money he would probably have left Australia. There are many places in Europe where a gentleman with thirty thousand pounds could pass bis life very agreeably." 

 I stopped speaking, and we all sat In silence, thinking. When I had re- ferred to the danger that Mr. Summers had been in, Ella had nestled up to her father, and was now sitting holding his hands. " What was that mother of-pearl thing we found in the wicked 

 man's box ?" she asked. 

 " That, Ella, was the key to the cipher. You remember by that time I had found the hatpin below the bibbel, and Miss AJmyr had told nie of seeing Lessing handling your hat ; in fact, he was I stealing the hatpin." 

 I Every detail of the crime was then in my possession, written, however, so to speak, in a cipher wbich I could not read. Up till then, I had believed that Lessing was, as he pretended, an English tourist. To our finding that little piece of mother-of-pearl, Mr. Sum- mers and Keitli owe their lives. It is a South Sea Island fishhook. 

 �'Years ago, when I was in the islands, I learned how the natives have a subtle method of committing murder by driv- ing a long mat needle into the heart of the victim. As soon as I saw the fish- hook-which is not the sort of thing a man would bring from England-I guessed that Lessing bad been at some time in the South Seas, and bad there learned the secret." 

 " Yes," Sandown interposed, " you re- member I told you that there was a rumour that Cassidy, or Lessing as you call liim, had been there." 

 " I remember, Mr. Sandown," I said, " rind very pleased I was to have my conjecture verified. It Is a painful sub- ject to all of us, and I do not wisb to dwell on it. I will only say that the theory that Lessing murdered poor Charles in this way fits all the facts of the case as no other explanation does." 

 " Yes," Keith said, V' and the man whose brain unravelled this mystery, which not one in a thousand could have solved, was uuwilliug to undertake my defence, on the ground that be was a broken-down old lawyer. There is never to be any more of that sort of talk, Anthony, remember." 

 " You are mistaken, Keith," I an- swered. " I am among my friends, and I will say what I believe is the truth. Alcohol has impaired my brain so that it is not half as good as it once was. All the greater glory is due to Providence, who bas saved your life by means of so poor an agent. As Ella said to me, 'God would not permit such a great wrong to be done as that you should suffer unjustly.'" 

 ' Again we all sat in silence for some 

 time, and Ella at least, I think, was re- turning thanks where thanks were due. Sandown broke in upon our thoughts by remarking, "I might have known that i Cassidy would be 'cute enough to have 

 1 some poison about him. A man like N him would commit suicide any day in preference to going to gaol for some I years." 

 i "As you obliged me by not arresting him too soon, Mr. Sandown, yan �hall lose nothing by his death. Mr. Sum- mers has promised that your commis- sion in the matter of the land sale shall 

 1 come to over two hundred pounds." 

 ! The detective, who had worn a very, 

 solemn face since Lessing's death, brightened up at once. ~" 

 " Thank you, sir," be said. " I always like to have to do with gentlemen." 

 Ella and Keith were married In June, and shortly afterwards sailed for Eng- land. A little later the land in Mel- bourne was sold. It realised the hiu'i some sum of thirty-six thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven pounds, to give the exact figures. 

 And now it is a fortnight .before Christmas of the year in wh'eh these events took place. It is the a^t^raoon, and I am sittiug in the diulng-rooui at my cousin's station. The room is plea- santly cool, as there Js a roof of shingles beneath the iron one. This morning I received a letter from Ella. It runs : 

 " Dear Cousin Anthony,-Keith and I will be home in time for Christmas. I think I shall be glad to get back to the sunny ekies and wide, quiet, restful largeness of Australia. It was lovely, here when the lanes were lined with wild roses, and it was pleasant later ou 

 when autumn turned the green of the * leaves to golden browns ; but now the . trees are bare, and I agree with tho new-chum Australian \\ybo arrived in -England at this time of the year, and remarked that it was a mistake to ring- bark all the timber. I hope you have kept the promise you made me to write down the whole history of Keith's trial, so (that he and I can read it when wa grow old. I hope, too, you have not softened. How cruel I was to hfta once. I need to be reminded of it, for the dear fellow has always spoiled me, and continues to do so still. I have seen all your relations, who send manyi kind messages to you, which I will de- liver as soon as I eee you, and that will be in about a week from the time you get this letter. I have written to father, . asking (him and Aunt Jane to spend Christmas with us. HO you will have plenty of company soon. 

 "Meanwhile, I remain, ' den? Anthony, 

 " Your ever affectionate cousin, 

 "ELLA HOPE."
