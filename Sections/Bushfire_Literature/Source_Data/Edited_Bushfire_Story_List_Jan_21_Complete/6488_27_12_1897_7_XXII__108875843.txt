 'ir you do that, Tristram,' she said, 'you will be doing a very foolish thing. If there were no other reason against it, you would be throwing away your chance of a seat. After this affair, you are sure to get in at the first opportunity; but, if you leave the country, it is certain to have a bad effect Perhaps you have not thought of this?' 'I have had every chance of doing so, at 

 ?***,y 4-a.M^, earn j.iju-u.4Uxi. JTLnJV �LHi}tl&y W3q with me- to-day, in a perfectly frantic condi tion. I never liked the man so well before; he ie ready to cut his tongue out for having maligned me, and, if I had not prevented ? him, he would have applied for the Ghiltern ?Hundreds to-morrow.' 'And why did you prevent him? It would ' .have been the best thing he could have done.' 'It did not seem so to me,' said Tristram, quietly. 'It was a mistake, and not malice, and he has no right to plunge the constituen cy into another contest, to satisfy his private sense of remorse.' 'But you ought not to be left under a cloud!' 'Those whose opinion I care for have never looked upon me as under a cloud; and as for the public, the newspapers which misled it may put it right again. However, he would not be held back from making a confession at Bennington.' 'I am glad of that But all this does not show me why you should set off on the chase ?' of which you spoke. Everybody Trill be won dering over it, and� I hardly like to say it, even to you � but is it well that your name . should be mixed up any further with the ' story?' 'I cannot help knowing what you mean,' said Tristram; 'but it is a subject which must never be discussed between us. You need not be afraid, no one will know what my real object is in going. After my late illness, it can be matter for no remark that I should go for a voyage, and, if I should bring Weston back with me, it ought to shut all mouths for ever. Don't try to hinder me, mother,' he added, in a lower tone; 'there is no hope of happiness for me unless it be in giving happiness to her.' Lady Carlyle felt grieved and discontented; in spite of all his arguments. He seemed to her to be Quixotic in his notions, and, more over, she could not satisfy herself that he was acting prudently. 'We shall see what Hylda thinks of it,' she remarked. x v'No, we shall not,' said Tristram, decisive ly; 'she will know nothing of it; she has quite enough to bear, without having this added suspense.' Lady Carlyle's private opinion was that no one had had so much to bear in the matter as her son had done; but she knew that he would not thank her for telling him so, and, therefore, she said nothing. If she could have seen her niece that night however, she might have altered her views. It was late when Hylda arrived at Yar mouth, for Easter was near and the trains were crowded; she was weary and worn in mind and body, and though she had written to announce her coming, .she had a nervous fear that the letter might have been delayed, and that she was not expected. In this fear she was confirmed when she reached Yar mouth, for there was no familiar face upon the platfonn, but she could not go back asain, and having secured her luggage she set off to the house. If she received a second rebuff she should be in despair, for she could not stay alone at Beryl Villa, nor would it satisfy Richard's suspicions for any of her own peo ple to be with her. The servant who opened the door expi^essed no surprise at seeing her, however, and she ' was shown upstairs to a room whence the sound nf 'loud voices met her ear; a family tempest was evidently blowing, and her heart beat apprehensively. Her entrance was hardly noticed for the moment, and her eye travelled quickly from one member to another of the excited greup. Mr. Westomstood on the hearthrug, his hand Clenched and his face purple with rago; Mrs. (Weston sat on the sofa, her comfortable form convulsed with sobs, and tears raining down her ample cheeks: Jo was sitting perched on a table, savagely biting the nails of one hand, while he beat a defiant tattoo with the ether; Ellen and Ralph Rhodes stood together in the centre of the room, his face white and set, while she looked at him with an expression In which grief and pride strove together. Flo alone seemed to be taking no parf in the fray; she stood apart by the window and kept her face turned away from, the rest Jo was the first to -perceive that a new comer had appeared on the scene. He jump ed off the table, and came to meet her with 'an effusive welcome. 'Here, come to mother!' he said. 'You do look bad, and it's not much wonder!' He led her to the 6ofa, and Mrs. Weston clasped her in a damp embrace, rocking to and fro the while, and uttering incoherent words of affection and woe. 'There, look at that poor thing!' exclaimed Mr. Weston, pointing an emphatic finger at his daughterrin-law. 'Completely crushed! Can you look'at such a sight as that, and per sist in your inhuman folly?' . 'Hylda would be the first to t-id me go on,' replied Ralph. 'Nonsense, sir!' thundered the old man. 'Hylda is not such a fool. I can only tell you this� unless you do as I wish, my daugh ter shall never marry you.' 'Will you give me up?' said Ralph, turning to Ellen. 'Never !' said Ellen. 'So you defy me to my face, do you?' cried Mr. Weston, scowling at his daughter, 'as he rushed off upon a new tack. 'Well, if you choose to be a beggar, you can. Not a halfpenny shall you ever get from me, and come what may, you shall never darken my door again!' Hylda had extricated herself from Mrs. ?Western's arms by this time, and sat in utter bewilderment amid the turmoil. 'I must go,' said Ralph, as the clock struck, 'I have only just time to catch my tram.' 'And you really mean to hold this meeting at Bennington?' 'Yes.' 'Very well; say good bye to Ellen here and now.' 'That I cannot do!' Hylda's brain began to reel with fatigue and confusion; the storm of angry voices, impas sioned sobs) and stamping feet grew; louder ;and louder; she closed her eyes wearily, but opened them again in terror, imagining that ?Mr. Weston had hurled Ralph to the ground. It was only the shimming of the door, how ever. ' Ralph had gone, Jo was tearing after Wm with, a parting expostulation, Ellen was ^hurrying to the window to catch a last glimpse, Mrs. Weston was beginning to dry her eyes, .and her. husband took out hie red eilk handkerchief and wiped the drops from his forehead. Flo took advantage of the pause to come up ito Hylda. ~;- ? 'Shall I take you to. your room?', she said. 'You must be quite worn out', . ; 'Yes,' take her away,' Mrs. '^Weston said; ?'she's a. poof martyred' dear, and I don't won der ;4hat that: Heartless villain hadn't'the face to look at tier.' ?'.''??- 'Mother,' said Ellen: turning round from the window, 'you must not speak of Ralph like1 that; 4ie is only doing what he. believes to be right'' . : ; . .; '??_ -\\ . The storm was evidently coming iip again, and wi&tiut, Raiting for more, Flo drew Hyl da otit offfle room and took her upstairs. 'What is it all' about?' asked Hylda/ as soon as they were alone. . i ??.''-'-:? FJo did. not answer at once; she helped Hyl da, to. take off her things and settled her upon the sofa, then sitting down on the floor beside her, she hid her face in her bande. ' ' ? ' ' ? ,' ? :.'. ' :'! 

 *Tell me,' said Hylda, unable to restrain iier anxiety. ??--.' ; ^j-T. ????;?/?'?? __ 'It is about Ralph,' said Mo, looking up; 'he saw Sir Tristram Carlyle jyesterday, and told him that he should deelarefhe truth pub licly. He came here to-day to tell my father and Ellen, and you saw how he was re ceived.' ' '. . ' She hid her face again, and Hylda waited ia sickening suspense; there was-much sto- hear yet. 'You see,' she -went on at last, 'they all be* lieve in Richard still.' 'And you?' asked Hylda. The -words were no more than a whisper, but Flo heard them and shivered. 'I cannot!' she said, hoarsely. There was silence for some minutes, then looking at Hylda with an- expression of agony she added, 'And it is all my fault!'? 'No, no, you must not say that!' cried Hyl da. 'We have all been to blame in one way and another. It is a terrible story.' Again there was silence, from which Flo roused herself with an effort. 'I must tell you the rest,' she said. 'Father thinks that it is all a newspaper lie,' and that Ralph is going blindfold into a trap that has been laid for him; mother would never be lieve a word against Richard whatever hap pened, and she has done nothing but cry since we first heard . it, while Jo says that he doesn't care a rap what anybody says, he is going to stand up for his brother flirough thick and thin.' 'And Ellen?' 'I hardly know what Ellen thinks. She is more inclined to blame Richard than any of the others, but I expect it is only because she is determined to uphold Ralph.' Hylda sighed; to hope for rest in such a strife as this was something like sitting down on a hornets' nest and hoping for ease! 'Perhaps I shall make things worse if I stay' she said at last 

 'Oh, no; you must stay!' cried Flo. 'I cannot do without you.' Hylda had never imagined that she would live to be thankful for Flo's friendship, but hi that moment of desolation the feeling that anyone wanted her seemed to break the ice about her heart 'There is no one but you who can under stand nie, just now,' went on Flo. 'I dare not tell.tb.ein what I really feei;#it would only make another disturbance. There is no fear of anything unpleasant being said to you;, they are all ready to make a martyr of you, as you saw just now.' 'But what am I to do?' 'Oh, you must just hold your peace. After all, neither you nor I can proclaim Richard's guilt for him; he must do that himself.' 'He will never do that!' said Hylda. sadly. 'Don't give up in that way. Tney have all written him the most loving letters, telling him that they quite understand his wishing to get out of the way of the trouble, but that, whatever may be said, nothing will ever alter their faith in him. I am certain that he will come back, if only to clear Ralph, for father has told hiiri that Ralph shall be banished for ever as a punishment' Flo's account of the situation was a correct one, and Hylda found no relief for her over strained nerves in the days that followed, for there were continual disputes, varied by bursts of rage or grief from one or other of the party. Their belief hi Richard, if she 

 coma nave snarea it, noma. .nave seemeu to her beautiful in the extreme; but as it was, i each expression of it was only an added pang. '? She could not even share Flo's anticipations, i for her fuller knowledge of Richard's charac ter gave her but little hope; but so long as there was a chance of his making reparation she felt that he ought to have the benefit of it Her only comfort was in her conversations with Flo, who evinced a depth of sympathy and an amount of good sense that were al most incredible. Shaken out of the groove in which she had lived so long, with her ad mirers forgotten and her fashions neglected ehe was a different person, and Hylda found some faint consolation in the fact. With Ellen h'er relations were not nearly so agree able, for, much as she had at first preferred her elder sister-in-law, there was an insur mountable barrier between them now. Ralph Rhodes had been as good as his word, and he had told his constituents the true stats of the ease, amid counterblasts of groans and cheers; but, while he freely confessed his own mistake, he said nothing of Richard's guilt, and Ellen might well be excused for loving i and admiring him more than ever. And yet, though she agreed with all he said and didU his views were more fn accordance with those of Flo and Hylda than with hers; for, in spite of aU, she persisted in disbelieving that her brother had done more than share in a mistake. They had no chance of disputing over it, for they were not allowed to meet, but the difference of opinion between her j lover and herself was a very bitter drop in j Ellen's cup. The preparations for her wed I ding had all been laid aside in obedience to j her father's command, for, though she would 1 not give up her engagement, she would not J marry in defiance of his wishes. She could 1 not go back to her charitable works in her j present state of suspense and despair, and so ! she was reduced to wandering about in a ! m-siiable solitude, that Hylda pitied but co-aid do nothing to remedy. ? ; Things were hi this state when one day Jo exclaimed loudly over the morning paper: 'So he's off, too!' he said. 'Who is off?' asked his father. , Jo read out the paragraph: 'Sir Tristram Carlyle, who has been in an unfavorable etate of health since his late illness, embark ed yesterday for a voyage round the world. A number of friends -were present to see him off, and expressed their hopes that tie would return completely restored?' 'If ; he had gone a few months ago all this might have been saved,' said Mra Weston, regretfully. 'I always said he was at the bottom of the mischief,' remarked her husband, 'and his skulking off in this way just proves it. That : rascal Rhodes will go next, mark my words!' Ellen clenched her hands tightly together, but she said nothing; she had schooled her self to silence, though not to patience. 'I am glad he has gone,' said Jo. 'One villain less makes the air clearer to breathe.' Hylda had realised long ago that Richard's -family had quite lost sight of the fact of her having been a Carlyle hi the far more im portant one of her having become, a Weston. She was. not surprised at the frankness of their remarks, therefore; but, in any case, she would hardly have heeded them. Let them think what they liked, her whole being was absorbed in one conviction, that impressed itself more strongly upon her with every- mo- ment; the motive of Txistram's journey was as plain to her as though he had told .her of it with his own lips; whatever reasons or explanations might be given to the world, she knew that he had gone to seek Richard. CHAPTER XXIIL It was a fine afternoon in May. The au tumn wind blew freshly and the sun shone brilliantly from a clear sky. The city of Melbourne was looking its gayest, and a throng of loungers paraded up and down Col lins-street in all the glory of fashionable cos tumes; gossiping, laughing, greeting then? ac quaintances, and gazing into the shop win dows. v A young man, came along tfie flagged foot-, way just as the promenade reached its most crowded time,. but .though {here was some thing in his appearance that -marked iiim out as a stranger, he paid but;3ittle heed to his surroundings, threading 'bis ?? way - quickly, through the jostling groups.: of people, ancL passing indifferently by the most dazzling ap paritions of Melbourne beauty. It was only when he .turned'intdjSpring-street.tliat Sis Jn- j terest seemed to be aroused, and, as soon as' he reached the Treasury Buildings, he turn ed in and found his way to the Police Depart- ; ment- /;?- Although Tristram had set out from Eng land with the fiill determination to fliid Rich ard -Weston before ae returned, ; he^khew.fhsut ' suck a task would be a hopeless one if he* attempted it alone; Happily, lie was inde 

 pendent of money considerations, and v?as; therefore aWe to engage ihe detective who had already Jjeen employed on the case, and who travelled with him in the guise of his ! servant They had followed up their man j as far as Melbourne, but here all trace of j him was lost, and though a fortnight had passed since they had first communicated with the local authorities, nothing had yet been heard. Tristram's health had improved wonder fully on the voyage, and the new sensation of adventure acted like a powerful tonic on his frame. He felt ready for any amount of fatigue and excitement, and his interest in the novel scenes around him increased every dayV Even the sadness of his quest could Hot hin der his spirits from rising, and the hidden longing for a wild freedom that lingers in most men's breasts had asserted itself in con tradiction to the habits of a lifetime,, and taken full possession of him. He looked alert and eager, as he entered the Police Depart ment on thia afternoon; Ms face was sunburnt, his eyes were bright, 'and his friends at home would scarcely have recognised him. 'I have some news for you at hist,' said the inspector, as he looked up from his desk. ? 'Well done!' exclaimed Tristram. 'Where is he?' j 'He is not here at all.' 'So much the better,' said Tristram, visions of an exciting. up-country chase, of desperate gold-diggers and ruffianly bushrangers flitting before him as though he had been a school boy. 'Only let me know where he is, and I will start to-night' 'You can't start to-night,' said the inspec tor, stolidly, 'there:s no vessel.' 'No vessel! Has he gone along the coast, then?' , 'No, he has gone home again.;' Tristram looked at him in 'dismay; was there ever a flatter and more disappointing ending? He had pictured himself in many dramatic scenes, dragging Richard out from a bush fire, saving him from the attacks of assassins, rescuing him in some lonely hut from the clutches of a deadly fever! To be defrauded of such a climax was bad enough, but to return absolutely empty-handed was worse still. By the time he reached England the man he had been in search of would be safe at home again, and his wild-goose er rand would be a matter of mirth to all who heard of it He ground his teeth savagely, and the in spector might well be excused for mistaking his feelings. 'Yes, he's escaped for this time,' he said. 'But, never mind, you'll get .him yet. I've known men save up a revenge for years, and find it all the better for keeping in the end.' 'What made him start off again, do you think?' asked Tristram, without entering up on a discussion of his motives. 'Well, I should fancy he got wind of your being here. If you remember, your arrival was mentioned in the papers.' 'I wish the papers would leave things alone,' said Tristram, thinking with some bitterness of the part they had played hi his career. 'There wouldn't be much reading in them if they did,' returned the inspector. 'You can't tell me what he is likely to do next, I suppose?' asked Tristram. 'Well, that is a matter of guesswork; but, still, a guess will do no harm. He took his passage for England, but, from all you have told me, I should doubt his going there yet awhile. If I were you, I would cable in structions to the authorities at Brindisi.' 'Thank you,' said Tristram, 'I will take your advice.' He took his departure with a sense of dis appointment that he found it in vain to com bat All the spirit seemed to have been taken out of his enterprise. He went back with lagging feet to communicate the result of his inquiries. Tanner, the detective, was an enthusiast in his work, and cared no more for its surround ings than a fox-terrier cares for the beauty of the scenery in which he catches his rats. The search was everything to him, and the place in which it was carried on was a matter of complete indifference. His one idea was to get off without delay, and, in the end, he suc ceeded in infecting his employer with his eagerness, so that Tristram saw the land of his desire fading from his sight with less re gret than he had anticipated. The forced inaction of the voyage was a sore trial to ! him, but, before it was over, he had taken himself to task for his selfishness; how could I he have lost eight of the advantage to Hylda I in Richard's speedy return? Was he a boy, | thac he should be intoxicated with his first taste of liberty? He ought to be rejoicing that Richard's heart had so quickly turned towards home, instead 'of mourning over the fact that he was not to be allowed the tri umph of bringing back the wanderer. By the time they arrived at Brindisi he had succeeded in getting himself under control again, and when, after prolonged inquiries, news of Richard was heard from Turin, he set off with renewed zest His plans ha'd, however, undergone one important alteration; up to the present time he had intended to seek Richard out, assure him of his pardon, promise to do all he could to help him on his return, and lead him back to the wife whom he had deserted. But his solitary medita tions on board ship had resulted hi a change in the scheme, a change that consisted in no less than striking out his own part in the play. Richard's departure from Australia seemed to show that he was repenting of his own accord. He would do nothing more than watch hhii, and, as soon as he saw that his face was really set homewards, he would go quietly on his way and leave him to make his entry alone. With much expenditure of time and labor, the trackers followed .then? quarry from Turin to Zurich, from Zurich to Strasbourg, from Strasbourg to Frankfort, and from Frankfort to Namur. Here for a time they were foiled, and Tristram began to look anxiously for his English letters, expecting to hear of Richard's arrival. 'I believe I have found a clue,' said Tan ner, coming into the sitting-room of the Na mur Hotel one morning. 'I have just heard something from Brussels.' 'From Brussels! Are you 6ure you are not mistaken?' said Tristram. , ' He; had so completely convinced himself by this time that Richard was in England that he could hardly admit the possibility of his being close at hand after all. 'This is the letter,' said Tanner. 'It says that an Englishman,, whose only mark of identification was a W. on some of his clothes, was carried into the hospital at Brussels a week or two ago. If -we go over, we shall have a good chance of finding him without his being able to escape us.' 'We will go at once,' said Tristram; 'we are doing no good here, anyway.' A few hours later the two men stood in the vestibule of the hospital interviewing a White capped nurse. She could not recall the man of whom Monsieur spoke,� but he could ask for a eight of the books of admission, or would he please to walk through the wards? Tristram chose the latter alternative; he could not tell under what name or description Richard might have, been entered in the hos pital books, but, however altered by illness, Sie had no doubt of recognising him. , No success attended their search, however, and a careful examination of the porter only result ed :in- the fact that a man, believed to be an Englishman, had been- brought in by two gendarmes, insensible from a. fall -m *&? streets; tie M& re&ised to give any account oi -himself, and as soon as he was well enough he-had been discharged.- There was nothing ih.aU'/fliis that might not have applied to Richard, but on the other hand, it would, have applied equally well to a hundred; others; the' Wi;upon Ms clothes .would stand for fflany names besides Weston, and, after all, even if it should- be Richard .himself, they were : no nearer finding him than they had been be* feine/ ???�???.? . ? . . ?? ? .? � ..
