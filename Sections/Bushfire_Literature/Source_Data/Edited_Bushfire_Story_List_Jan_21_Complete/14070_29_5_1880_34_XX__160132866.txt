THE SKETCHED 

 YARNS ON OLDEN TIMES. 

 By G. B. VT. 

 CHAPTER XX. 

 " Look how busy these beggars are, and what a fine looking lot compared to the Bay tribe, who have been gorging on whale beef." "Holloa, Doctor," they cry," how long yon sit down here ? Yon come to aee corroborie, plenty fight to* moller ? Yob, come to see, bnt why yon fight; no good; plenty kill yon; plenty spear." "No kill 'urn," said Jim, "plenty fight." "Why fight ?" said the doctor. " Oh too much plenty growl; too much steal 'am lnbra." And this was all the explanation they conld give. All the men were busy. There were few women abont and no children, and all their occupations seemed to be in anticipation of the fight. They had plenty of spears, and these were being examined and repointed by scraping with broken glass and then hardening in the ashes. The shields were pieces of bark cut solid from the trees, and then baked in the ashes so as to make them tough and hard, and then they were smeared over with ochre and charcoal, relieved with stripes of chalk, so as to make them quite 

 ornamental as well as useful. Some were col lecting boughs of trees and logs of wood and pieces of bark for the grand illumination; while others were smearing their bodies all over with grease and pigments, every now and then start ing up and cutting strange capers and contor tions to see how these scanty decorations fitted, just like a belle before her glass looking down her back to see if the dress sits well behind. The women looked on ad miringly, but it is likely that the good-looking ones had been left behind, for those in view were most certainly plain and old. The sun sank down in a huge red mass, and the lurid clouds tipped with molten gold denoted another blazing day to-morrow, whilst the silver moon at its full soon took possession and diffused a clear silvery light, showing out each quivering leaf in the lofty trees at the back of the camp. The place chosen for the corroborie was eqni-distant between the two camps, and here there was a level piece of ground, Bhaded by some old weird-like gums, scorched and hollowed in places by numerous bush fires, but still showing scanty vegetation on their tops. A small fire was burning in the centre of this cleared space, and several of the Bay tribe had already collected, each of the men carrying a Bmall bough stripped from the gum-trees. The women were seated in a semi-circle, and the children squatted behind or alongside of them. 

 Presently all the Bay performers seemed to be collected, and one of tho old men stood close to the fire, and turning to the Murray Gamp nttered some loud harsh gutturals as a chal lenge or an invitation. This was quickly re sponded to, and soon might be seen appearing and vanishing amongst the trees the forms of naked painted men with their shields on the left arm, and a green bough in the right hand. They marched silently into the circle, of which .they appropriated half, whilst the women squatted down, and removing their rugs and skins stretched them across their distended knees. A few boughs of dried leaves were thrown on the fire, which blazing up, -brought out clearly all the points of the landscape. Two men from each side now stepped more into the front, and com menced a low chant, which at a given signal was taken up by all the others, and gradually in creased in volume. The women joined in, and striking the skins they bad stretched over their knees, produced a sound like muffled drums; whilst others, who had not the drum accompani ment, struck their naked thighs with the hollow palms of their hands, but all keeping most exact time. The melted grease and the colours on the men's bodies (the 

 women bad their natural complexion polished up with oil or fat), gave them a most unearthly appearance, and the flickering of the blaze from the fire falling on their naked bodies and their bright piercing eyes was suoh as to picture to the imagination the very semblance of a carnival of devils. The music, for music it undoubtedly was though rather monotonous, rose and fell in regular cadence, and when the sound was at its utmost, at a moment it stopped, and all the green boughs being simultaneously drawn through the air made a swith like the sadden rising of myriads of birds through the air. The spectators on our side could not understand the language, but part of the performance was intelligible enough. 

 A few boughs of trees were formed into a tern-' porary wurlie or sleepiDg-place, and in this two of the young men, not decorated like the men, but te represent women, were supposed to be sleep ing. The natives enlarged the circle and each held up his green bough, which seemed to be their idea of standing at ease. Presently from the outside appeared a couple of young men in full war paint, with their spears and clubs, evi dently looking for some object. The living statues around seemed to represent trees, and in and amongst these the two hunters crouched and glided, now stooping with hand shading their eyes and moving noiselessly along, then prone on the earth they squirmed on the ground like snakes, and by some peculiar force of the muscles glided over the surface. Again they were erect but very cautious, when some alarm must have arrested them, for they remained stationary not seeming to breathe even, and with their heads lowered between the shoulders they in different immovable attitudes repre sented burned logs. In all this meeting not a sound was heard and all the sign of life was in the excited eyes which followed every movement. Presently the cause of discovery appeared to have vanished, and the youths resuming their natural positions showed the immense exertion they had undergone by the perspiration forcing its way through the glistening fat on .their bodies and running down their limbs. Cau tiously they make the circuit when a sadden start shows that they have discovered the sleep ing women. They approach the wurley and peep in, then stretching their bodies and stand ing on their foes they gaze anxiously around, evidently to discover if there are any of their enemies about. Seemingly satisfied they each select their prize, and with waddy uplifted, they nudge them with their toes. The sleepers thus suddenly awakened open their wondering eyes to behold their enemies, and one is just upon giving a scream when down the weapon falls upon her head. The other woman utters not a sound but evidently takes this as a lessen. They are made to rise up, collect their'bits of skins and a basket or two, and accompany their captors, who march behind them and now and then with a prod behind accelerate their movements when they disappear in the darkness. The fire has burned low and little, but the moon's rays illuminate the Bcene, when four men evidently fresh from the chase approach the sleeping place. They appear surprised at the absence of the women and shout their names. They now look around, soon dis cover fresh tracks, which are carefully Bcanned, and a few drops of blood from the wounded woman which have fallen on the ground lash them to fury. They leap to their feet and utter a shrill piercing cry. 

 Bob and the doctor had been excited observers of all these proceedings, and in their interest had gradually worked up to the extreme edge of the outer circle when this piercing cry was heard. Instantly the whole assembly were in violent motion and rushing about in all direc tions, so that Bob and his companion started bsck for a moment, believing that the whole was real and that the black savages were upon them. The crys, the yells, the brandishing of the boughs to represent clubs, were incessant, till the track of the enemy was followed up and all rushed out pellmell from the enclosure. OBce 'outside they became like the audience at a theatre when the curtain is dropped on some thrilling tragedy; when, after drawing a deep breath, every one commences laughing and talking to show how little they are affeoted, and the eye which still retained a tear of sympathy lights up with tbe merry jest. "That was fine," said Penny," I could well imagine such a scene in the bush and pity the poor victims�what a reality it must be to them?" "I expect they den't want much pity," said Bob. "They are used to it and it is only their energetic way of courting; it is well known that after a very short time they become quite domesticated, and will]follow their new spouses through thick and thin. You know that woman is proverbially fond of change." " Very likely you are right, but few would like the change from a sweet sleep to a thundering crack on the head," replied the Doctor. "But I have had enough of this, and propose that we go and have a glass of old McLoud's brandy and turn in, for I expect the fun is pretty well over." 

 The next morning after a swim in the sea, which was murmuring along the shore close to where they slept, they made their way to the Blaoke' camp. Here most of the natives were stretched out asleep, and covered up with old blankets, rugs, or skins, whilst some of the women and children were squatted about tbe fires boiling water in old pots, builli soup tins, or anything they could collect. Into these they put some leaves to stow, and those who were fortunate to have it, a little rice or gum from the aeacia and sugar. Some had a little flour and others a few pota toes, but these were mostly baked in the ashes. There were several wurlies; some had as many as a dozen lodgers, others only a man, one or two women, and a child or two; but all of them lots of dogs, who disputed the covering with the blacks, and rested their half-starved bodies close up to their masters. Bob's approach to the several lairs was greeted in every case with the same cry�"You give it bacca? You give it plower or rite ? You give it bickerty ? Plenty veryi hungry me." Each man as he walked up would stretch himself and glance all round, seemingly taking in every object within his view. Then, if he had no bacca to fill his pipe, he would unpack his bundle, and bring to light most extraordinary articles of food which had been left from overnight. A joint or two of dirty flabby mutton from some diseased sheep would be very nice, and the living crawlers only add to the weight for food. An opossum rat or iguana was a dainty, and not to be cavilled at. The young bachelors all camped together, and these seemed to be the most im provident, for very few had a scrap to break their fast, except perhaps a lump of gum; but they mostly could raise a pipe of bacca, and this, with a drink of water, stayed their appetites. Down at the public they found some of the better known of the blacks, who would fetch and cut up firewood, bring water, look after the horses or cows, and make themselves useful, and these would follow old Hr. McLoud as he went stumping about with his wooden leg to see that all his stock was attended to. " Now, you black varmint, what do you want. Yon, Billy, why not get water for horse and fill up the cask. You, Jerry, go see if cows back of hill. You bring em here. Plenty want milk for break fast. Now then, Tommy, go and cut um wood. Ah! here comes Bungo and Sam with some fish from the river. Very good, you; come in, give grog." All the blacks were both ready and wil ling, and Mac served out to each a good glass of rum, which, even when dilated with water, 

 made them catch their breath, and they started for their several occupations, while Bungo and Bam spread ont the fish on the table. They were all mnllet which had been trapped at the month of the river. This small river or creek had a bar at the month, as is nsoal almost in all on the coast, and here the tide washes over at the full, leaving it dry at low tides. Just inside 

 scksf 

 the month the blacks form webs with stakes and 

 wattled teatree like baBketwork, into which the fish swim at high water and are left stranded when the tide goes ont. From one of these the fish had been taken, and one large basketful given to McLond in exchange for some grog (a glassful each), floor, and meat, which latter were taken to the camp. Some of the young men returned with the carcase of a wild dog, which had been caught in a trap and from keeping had become tender and gamey, but very acceptable. Harrison and the Doctor having had theb swim and seen after theb horses, which were hobbled and feeding at a little distance, returned to breakfast, which they all enjoyed; good coffee, fish, eggs, and capital bread, and then, after lighting tbeir pipes, went to Bee the arrange ments for the fight.
