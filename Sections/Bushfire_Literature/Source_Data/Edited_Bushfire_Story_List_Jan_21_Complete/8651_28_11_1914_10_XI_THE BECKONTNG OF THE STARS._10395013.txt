 CHAPTER XI. 

 THE BECKONING OF THE STARS. 

 They went into the homestead. 

 Naringa, scalded and blinded, had groped his way out from the verandah and had departed, taking with him the dead body of the black who had been shot in the act of climbing through the window. The brothers surveyed the scene in the kitchen with astonishment �the smashed window panes, and splintered shutters, the door into the passage still barricaded by the heavy dresser, the cauldron on the log fire and the empty iron bucket standing beside it. Moira told them rapidly 

 what she had done. 

 "By the Lord, Moira," said Tom, with honest admiration, "you are a brave girl." 

 "It was dear old Tom who saved you, Moira," said Syd., with a sudden burst of candour, for he could not bear to sail under false colours. It was he who 

 raced all the way to get to you in time. He even left Billy and the young mare 

 struggling in the watercourse rather than stay to help them out. And he 

 reached the homestead just in time to bring down the buck who was getting 

 through the window. It was a long shot, too�and a good job that he did 

 not miss it." 

 Moira came straight over to where Tom was sitting, and kissed him on the forehead. "Tom," she said, with a quiver in her voice, "I believe you are the noblest-hearted man alive." 

 " 'Pon my soul, Moira, you'll spoil me if I stay here," said Tom, cheerily. He 

 rose to go. "Hullo," he said, "there's Billy at last. I'll go and see what has happened to him." 

 Tom walked�just a little unsteadily �towards the door, leaving Syd. and Moira sitting side by side in the room that had so lately been besieged. The long spear that had been hurled by one of the bucks was still sticking in the wall opposite the window. Tom walked out of Moira's house, and in the same moment as he confessed to his desolate heart, out of her life also, leaving his brother Syd�the much-loved, constant- ly-protected "little Syd." of long ago� in full possession. 

 The boy Billy, with his round eyes goggling with excitement and alarm, was leading the leg-weary mare to the shed that served as a stable. She had had more than enough galloping for one day. He told Tom his story. He had walked the mare three miles along the bed of the watercourse before he reached a place where he and the mare could climb out. Then he had made the best of his way to the homestead, keeping a sharp lookout for the blacks 

 all the time. 

 "You did not see wot they done to 

 old Ben. Mr. Tom," said Billy in a shaky voice. "Me t'roat gets like the 

 sole of me boot when I thinks of it." 

 Tom was still talking to Billy when Con. Burke himself rode up. He had been away to the far end of the run, and he was staggered to hear of the attack by the blacks, and of Moira's narrow escape. He ran off to the homestead to see Moira, and to learn her experiences from her own lips. 

 "Come along, Moira," he said, when she had finished her thrilling story, sitting beside Syd. Verner and holding his hand, "let's all ride over to Coon- ara, and tell Mr. Verner. He will be anxious to hear what has happened. Our three men came back with me from the out-paddocks.and they can look after the homestead while we are away. I don't fancy the blacks will come near the place again after the tremendous lesson that they have had." 

 So the two Verners and Con and Moira all rode off together in the cool of the evening, heading for Coonara. But Moira rode beside Syd., and what they talked about Con Burke did not know, because he was too far in front of them to hear. 

 But Tom Verner, who rode beside Con. could make a good guess. He was a silent companion during the long ride, for he was revolving a great plan in his 

 mind. 

 When they reached Coonara it was dark. Henry Verner was sitting with Juana and Aileen on the verandah, waiting anxiously for their return. He had his gun across his knees. He heard the sound of cantering hoofs, and c00- eed vigorously. Tom and Syd. both sent back a cheery answer, and in a few minutes the stirring tale of the day's adventures was being told again by Moira, with interpolations from Tom and Syd. 

 Aileen sat next to Con Burke, and Moira sat next to Syd., but Tom stood up by himself, and looked out into the sky�a dark blue velvet sky sprinkled with diamonds. His gaze was fixed on 

 the Southern Cross, low down near the 

 horizon. 

 The points of fire were beckoning to 

 him. 

 Con Burke and his sister Moira glad- ly accepted Juana's invitation to stay the night at Coonara, and, wearied out by the excitement of the day, the young people retired to rest soon after supper�but Tom still stood on the verandah, gazing at the Southern Cross, which was calling to him. 

 Juana came to him and took him by the hand. "Tom, dear," she said, "you are unhappy, and I know the reason. I am so sorry, for you, my own dear 

 lad." 

 So Tom told her everything in his simple, straightforward way. It was true that he loved Moira, but Syd. loved her too ; and in the soul-revealing crisis brought about by the attack of the buckeeners Moira's love for Syd. was disclosed with staggering clearness. 

 "But what then will you do, my Tom," asked Juana, with tears in her 

 eyes. 

 "I am going away from home, mother," said Tom, "for a little while, at any rate. Afterwards, if all goes well, I will come back to you." 

 "But where will you go, my Tom ?' 

 asked Juana, in sad bewilderment. She dreaded the thought of losing her eldest son, who was born amid the rattle of the guns, at Toulouse. 

 "I am going yonder," said Tom, pointing southward, where the starry cross lay close to the horizon. I am going down to that fine new country in the south. I am going to Port Phillip.'' 

 When Henry Verner came out to bring Juana in from the verandah Tom told him everything, and Verner, who felt a strong bond of sympathy uniting him with the son who had been born at the close of that great campaign of long ago, reluctantly consented. 

 Cheerily next morning Tom set about preparing for his departure. 

 But first the three young men had to perform a solemn duty. The dead body of old Ben still lay in the hut unburied. 

 So Con Burke and Tom and Syd. Verner, taking tools and spades with them, drove down to the old shepherd's hut and made a rough bush coffin of sawn wood. They placed in it the body of the victim of the buckeeners, and dug a grave close by on the bank of Lewis Ponds Creek. There they buried him, and Henry Verner, with Juana, and Aileen and Moira Burke, came and stood by the grave. Henry Verner read a prayer, and the three young men fired a volley from their shotguns over the last resting plac.e of the old shep- 

 herd. 

 But even in death old Ben was not destined to remain undisturbed. There came a day when strangers were to in- vade his solitude and rudely move his 

 bones. 

 When the bush funeral was over Tom announced to all that he intended to make a trip to the new settlement down in the south. Tales of Mitchell's won- derful journey to Portland, where he found the Hentys on their prosperous station, had already penetrated to Bathurst, and stories of the settlement that Batman and Fawkner had founded on the banks of the Yarra, and of the rich land that was to be obtained down south almost for nothing, flew from lip to lip. 

 Tom spoke sturdily of the magnificent, prospects at Port Phillip, and Syd. never dreamt for a moment that his brother's love for Moira was the real cause of his hurried departure. Deep down in her heart Moira knew the rea- son of the sudden resolve, but, she kept her own counsel. She never told Syd. What would be the use. Henry Verner and Juana talked the matter over to- gether, and came to the same conclu- 

 sion. 

 When Tom left the beautiful home where he had spent so many happy years and started for Sydney to take passage there in the schooner Stella for Port Phillip, he said good-bye bravely enough to his father and mother and sister Aileen, assuring them that he would soon return. But the parting from Syd. was harder. Both the brothers were strongly moved. Their lives were linked together by ties of daily companionship and closest in- timacy. Recollections of the past rush- ed to the minds of both�recollections of events in which Tom was always the helper and Syd. the helped. And now they had to part at last. 

 "Cheer up, Syd., old boy." said Tom, with the old protecting look in his eyes. It won't be long before we meet again. Say good-bye for me to Moira. So long, dear lad. I'm leaving you to look after the old folks till I come back again." 

 And then he went away, but the real reason of his going Syd. Verner did not find out until long afterwards. 

 As Tom Verner said good-bye to his brother and rode off on the first stage of his journey, lured by the beckoning of the Southern Cross, a strange scene was being enacted in a lonely Cali- fornian valley, through which flowed the Sacramento River. Snow lay deep on the ground. An icy blast whistled down the valley. On a rough bunk in a tattered tent, an old man lay dying. He had left the sunshine of Australia for the snows of the Sierra. Pneumonia had seized him in its deadly grip. 

 "Bend down your ear, Mr. Har- graves," he whispered, huskily, "there's something I want to tell you before I 

 die." 

 "You're not going to die yet awhile, Jim," said the other man, cheerily, making an effort to reassure the sufferer. But Jim was under no delu- sion. 

 ''I'm sent for all right, Mr. Har- graves." he whispered. "But listen. We've got no gold in this God-forsaken valley. We'd have done better if we had stayed at home in our own country. There's plenty of gold within gunshot of the old place on the Bathurst 

 Plains." 

 "Poor old Jim! His brain is wander- ing." said Hargraves to himself, and the dying man read the unspoken words 

 in his face. 

 "No, Mr. Hargraves," muttered Jim. "My memory is quite clear. Before I came over here with you I found gold myself in New South .Wales. I never told anyone, but I'm going to tell you now." His face was quite blue. He could hardly speak. Hargraves poured a little brandy into a cup and moisten- ed the dying man's lips with it. 

 "Where was the place, Jim ? Where was the place?" 

 Old Jim half raised himself on his elbow. He pointed southward, with extended arm. 'Down south," he mut- tered, with a last effort. "Down south, 

 under the Southern Cross. At the meeting of Lewis Ponds Creek and Summerhill Creek. You know the spot, Mr. Hargraves. You know the spot where the two boys of Mr. Verner's used to play�long ago." 

 Old Jim, the shepherd who had gone with Edward Hammond Hargraves from New South Wales to California in the great rush of the "forty-niners," fell back dead; but his dying words to Hargraves set in motion a train of great events that brought Tom Verner 

 and his well-loved brother Syd. together again at last, though far from the old 

 home of their boyhood. 

 CHAPTER XII. 

 GOLD-FEVER BREAKS OUT. 

 Tom's letters came to Coonara very irregularly, for the mails were few and 

 far between in those days. He wrote that the new settlement at Port Phillip was experiencing a wave of depression, and that many people were leaving the country. He had decided not to take up any land for the present. And then one day there came a letter to his father, in which Tom said that he had yielded at last to his old craving to be a soldier. He had enlisted in the 40th Regiment. 

 "As you were a soldier yourself, father," wrote Tom, "you will under- stand how I have always loved the army. I can never forget that I was born on the march. Tell mother not to grieve for me, because I am very happy here now, and I like the life so much that I have no desire to leave 

 it." 

 "I always felt, my Henry," said Juana, as she read the letter again and again, dwelling with loving eyes on the handwriting of her eldest son. "that Tom would turn soldier in the end. The rattle of the drums was in his blood, 

 I think. Shall I ever forget that long march, on my little white burro, all the way, from Victoria to Toulouse, where Tom was born on the last day of the war." 

 "Indeed, it seems like destiny," said Henry Verner. "Tom would always leave everything and everybody to watch the soldiers. I was like that myself once, so I can hardly wonder at him. I warrant that he will he a good soldier, too, and a bravo one. Cheer up, Juana, dearest. We will go down to Melbourne and see him in the spring." 

 But they did not go to Melbourne in the spring, because great events hap- pened almost at their doors, and they stayed to watch the surging flood of humanity that swept over the country, destroying old landmarks and threaten- ing to sweep away their second son upon its raging flood. 

 The new era in Australia was ushered in by a long, dry summer of unpre- cedented heat, and on the 6th of Febru- ary came Black Thursday, when the greater part of New South Wales and Victoria was on fire, and when thou- sands of head of stock and not a few hapless human beings who were caught and cut off perished in the flames. 

 A few days later, Syd. was riding through the country, that bordered upon Henry Verner's property, point- ing out to Moira Burke, who rode be- side him, the ravages caused by the bush fires, he came with his companion to Lewis Ponds Creek. And there was the very pool almost dried up now after the long, hot summer, into which he had fallen when he was a small boy, and from which Tom had saved him, diving for him after he had sunk. Syd- ney Verner told the story again to Moira, and Moira's eyes filled with 

 tears. Dearly as she loved Syd., she could never forget that chivalrous elder brother, who had saved her from the buckeeners, and who went away from his home when he found that her love was not for him, but for Syd. 

 As Syd. and Moira rode along the bank of Lewis Ponds Creek deep in their thoughts, they became aware of a tall man with grizzled hair and beard, who stood in the bed of the creek, at- tended by a lad, whom they recognised as the son of the landlady of the little inn at Guyong. The tall man had a tin pan in his hand. He was washing the clay from the bed of the creek in it and pouring off the dissolved clay and water with a circular motion that presently got rid of all the contents of the dish, leaving it quite empty. 

 No, not quite ! 

 A residuum of shining, yellow grains lay at the bottom of the tin dish. Syd. could see it quite plainly from the top 

 of the bank. 

 "Hullo, Mr. Hargraves. Where have you been for the last couple of years, and what are you doing down there in 

 the creek?" 

 The tall, grizzled man looked up with a smile. "Ha! Verner. I see you've caught me fairly. I've been away in California, looking for gold ; and now I find that it was here in abundance all the time, close to my old home and yours." He carefully scraped the yel- low grains out of the tin dish and placed them in a small glass bottle, which was already half full of gold dust. "This is a red-letter day for Australia. I shall be a baronet. This lad, who has acted as my guide, will be knighted, and my old horse grazing over there will be stuffed and sent to the British Museum." 

 Gold ! 

 The fever of it leaped into Syd. Verner's veins. Sliding from his horse, he questioned Hargraves breathlessly. 

 "I reached Sydney from San Fran- cisco only last month, in the barque Emma," said Hargraves. "I was in California for more than a year. I've been up in San Joaquin and to the Sierras�on the Sacramento and the Feather River and the Yuba. I put in a h�l of a time there�travelled hundreds of miles, been attacked by grizzly bears, been nearly frozen to death, been within a coo-ee of starva- tion many a time. But I found gold, and I saw the lie of the country�slates, quartz, granite, and red soil, just the same as here. That's why I came back. And now I've got it, I've got it, I've got it !" 

 He executed a wild war dance in the bed of the Lewis Ponds Creek, and Moira watched him with amazement. She watched Syd. with amazement, too. 

 He was completely enthralled by Har- graves and his story. All the way back to the homestead Syd. talked of Hargraves and the gold that lay in the 

 drift of the creek bed. 

 Hargraves returned with his guide to Guyong the same night, and wrote a report of his discovery to Mr. Deas Thomson, the Colonial Secretary; but he was back at the creek next day, and Syd. Verner joined the little knot of men who began pan-washing under his directions. Syd. had the gold fever very badly indeed. He attached him- self to Hargraves and went with him, and the two local youths who accom- panied him as guides�Lister, the son of the landlady at Guyong ; and James Tom�on a prospecting trip down the Summerhill Creek, all the way to its 

 junction with the Macquarie. They got gold almost everywhere along the creek. 

 Then Hargraves tried the Macquarie River itself. He got gold there, too. Ascending the tableland from the Mac- quarie with him, Syd. Verner could see the Turon Mountains in the distance. 

 Thither he travelled with young Lister and James Tom, and returning to the Macquarie, found Hargraves there, and reported to him that his pre- diction was fulfilled. There was gold on the Turon : they brought a few ounces back with them in proof. 

 Mr. Deas Thomson sent up Mr. Stutchbury, the Government Geologist, to see Hargraves, and examine into the genuineness of his alleged discoveries. Mr. Stutchbury arrived, and Syd. Verner watched him dig out a pan full of "dirt" from a spot in the bed of the Lewis Ponds Creek, within a few yards of the site of the original discovery. Mr. Stutchbury washed the dirt in the pan and got good gold. He repeated the operation several times at different places in the Summer Hill Creek and the Lewis Ponds Creek, and almost in- variably found gold in the pan. 

 The genuineness of the discovery was assured, and the rush was not long in coming. 

 Oh! those wild months in the bitter winter of 1851, when men began to stream over the Blue Mountains from every part of Australia and from every country in the world to Ophir and Tarshish�so named by Hargraves�in search of the yellow metal, for which many of them bartered life�and even 

 desecrated death 

 It was in the early days of the Ophir rush that the bones of old Ben, the shepherd, who had been killed by the buckeeners, were rudely disturbed. Both banks of the creek were taken up for several miles, and a party of Italians had pegged out a claim which included the area upon which stood the shep- herd's grave. They sunk a shaft down 

 through loose earth, which had evident- 

 ly been previously excavated, and to their amazement came upon a rough coffin of slabs. Pietro's pick went through the lid of the coffin, and dis- closed the face of the corpse. Pietro was horribly frightened, and scrambled out of the hole as fast as he could, but Guiseppe, who was working the cradle, insisted that the occurrence of a corpse in a claim was an indication of ex- traordinary luck. After hauling out the coffin by means of their windlass, the Italians continued digging, and bottomed on the day a couple of feet below the dead man's resting place. They took out seventy ounces of gold from the ground under the coffin, chiefly in the form of small slugs and 

 waterworn nuggets. 

 If Tom and Henry Verner had ex- cavated the ground a couple of feet deeper when digging a grave for old Ben, they must have found this "jewel- ler's shop," and won the fame that so 

 

 soon afterwards was reaped by Har- 

 graves. 

 As for old Ben, it mattered nothing to him. The Italians replaced the coffin, and the corpse that it contained, after they had cleaned up the pocket of nuggets, and then they filled in the excavated ground again. Possibly old Ben's last sleep was disturbed by a swiftly-passing dream�a dream of dark faces and flashing eyes and joyful ex- clamations. But that was all. He could turn to his rest again with the long, long night of eternity before him. 

 So Verner surrendered himself to the frenzy of the time. Dazzled by the golden gleam he gave up father and mother and sister, and even Moira Burke his beloved, to follow it. He followed it to the Turon, to the Aber- crombie, and to half a dozen different rushes on the Macquarie. He found a little gold-just enough to whet his fierce craving for more. 

 Disappointed diggers began to stream back over the Blue Mountains, cursing Hargraves as the author of their miser- ies. Syd. Verner went with them, for he had heard wild tales of fabulously rich discoveries in Victoria�at Clunes and Anderson's Creek, at Mount Alex- ander, at Buninyong. 

 Camping with the friendly owner of a bullock waggon at Mount Vittoria that place which was named after the battlefield in Spain, where his father and his mother had first met many years before�Sydney Verner climbed a great rock by the side of the track and looked out into the night. Mount Vit- toria is the highest point on the Blue Mountains�a natural observatory. His gaze travelled far through the starlit sky.
