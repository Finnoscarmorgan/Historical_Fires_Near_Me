 "But who is this girl0" said Mm ray 

 doubtfully. "And why should she help 

 us?" 

 "She said she was a friend of Miss Lowther's." 

 "But do you think we can trust her, Jack? I don't understand." 

 "AV've simply got to trust her now," said Lawson, who began to regret an impulsiveness so foreign to his cus- tomary precaution. "And I'm sure we can. Rex," he added, as he recalled her eager glowing face and bright blue eyes. "You go to the horses and be ready, and I'll pick Miss Lowther up in that gig," and he pointed to a vehicle stand- ing close by. 

 "Come on, Rex," he said, as Murray still stood irresolute. "It's your only chance. Ride out past the stable, and we can make for the hut the way we came," and without further delay he took hold of the horse's head and led her round to the side of the verandah. Murray went over to where their own horses were, loosened their bridles off the fence, mounted his own and rode slowly in the direction of the stable. 

 Lawson's impatience can be imagined as the minutes slowly passed and no one appeared. He was beginning to bitterly regret his folly, when suddenly the fold- ing door flew open and Beryl appeared. 

 "Quick," she said, beckoning to Mar- garet, who was hesitating. 

 "Come on," said Lawson, and Mar- garet was just on tne point of stepping out on the verandah, when suddenly five or six men carne round the corner. Lawson saw McClure, Button's partner, in the party, saw his eyes travel from himself to Murray in the distance, saw the dawning suspicion in his face, and realised that instantaneous action alone could avert discovery. If Mar- garet had not been seen and she was screened by the folding door from their gaze, all might yet be well. All this flashed through his mind in the merest fraction of a second, and he instantly decided on his course of action. 

 "Come on, Miss Beryl," he said aloud. "We have just got time to drive down before the ceremony." 

 Beryl, with a tinge of red on her cheek, stepped forward at once. Law- son assisted her to her seat, jumped in himself, shook up the reins, and drove rapidly down the drive. Everyone turned to watch thein, and Margaret, trembling with excitement and fear, withdrew from the door and regained her room in safety. 

 "That was smart ot you," said Beryl, who was blushing most becomingly. 

 "It was a close call," said Lawson. "AVhere shall I drive?" 

 "Go to the overseer's cottage over there," said Beryl. "I am sorry we did not succeed." 

 "I'm afraid it's all up now," said Lawson, gloomily. 

 When they reached the cottage Beryl said a few words to the ra�an who caine to the door, and then Lawson drove her back again to the house. 

 "You can still count on me to help you if anything can be done," she said as she left him, and Lawson, having restored the gig to its original posi- tion, rejoined Murray, wdiom he found almost beside himself with disappoint- 

 ment. 

 "I'm afraid we have lost our oppor- tunity, Rex. It is close to one o'clock now," he said, glancing at his watch 

 Murray bit his lip, but said nothing. "The others are going into the hall, ' said Lawson a moment later. "Shall we join them, or-" 

 "I'll see this thing through," said Murray, savagely, and they according- ly made their way across to the hall, entered, and sut down. 

 There were about twenty-five or thir- ty people in the room, who were con- versing in low tones and keeping a sharp lookout for the first appearance of the bride and bridegroom. 

 Five, ten, fifteen, twenty minutes passed, during which Murray, with brain on fire and a tumult of emotion? raging in his breast, had to listen to a rattling fire of small talk from the lady next to hiin. Presently the guests began to comment on the delay and to guess at the reason, and a little later the report was spread that everything was in readiness and that they were only waiting for the clergyman, who had not yet arrived. 

 Murray's neighbour volunteered the information that Mr. Melville, the clergyman, had to ride twelve miles, but that he was sure to come be- fore long. An hour more, however, drasrged slowly by, and then a few of the company, Murray and Lawson amongst the number, left the building, and began to discuss what could have bapnened to delay Mr. Melville. 

 Meantime, Margaret had been in an agony of indecision. At one instant she felt reconciled to her fate and de- termined to go through with the mar- riage-at the next all her whole nature lecoiled at the idea, and all her throb- bing pulses clamoured for love and happiness. It had been with great dif- ficulty that Beryl had induced her to make the first attempt, and its failure after she had screwed her courage to the sticking point had left her utter- ly hopeless and dejected. She was composed again when the time appoint- ed for the wedding drew near, and her orly feeling when she wa� informed of the non-arrival of Mr. Melville was one of impatience, as she was now only an- xious to get through the ordeal and end the unendurable suspense. But as time went on and still the clercvman did not appear, a sudden hope flashed into her mind. Presently she found herself alone with Beryl again for the 

 first time since the scene on the ver- andah. 

 "Beiyl." she whispered, her eyes glis- tening like stars. "Is be still here?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Well, can't you do something? Is there no way? I mean-" 

 Beryl paused reflectively for a mom. ert, then replied : "I'll try and speak to Mr. Lawson again, Maggie, and see if we can do anything." And with that Margaret had perforce to be content. 

 Meantime, a strong north wind had sprung up, and several of the farmers piesent began to show signs of uneasi- ness, as it became evident from the smell of fire in the air that a bush-fire of considerable extent was in progress. One or two whose fai*ms lay in the di- rection towards which the fire was ap- parently making its way under the in- fluence of the strong northerly wind, which had sprung up during the morn- ing, began to make their excuses to Mr. and Mrs. Lowther. 

 "Mebbe, Mr. Melville has been stop- ped by the fire," said one. 

 "Oh, no," objected another. "The file is to the north of the track." 

 At this stage Murray caught sight of the bridegroom for the first time that day. Button was conversing with Mr Lowther, and his brow was black as a ti under cloud. 

 "I won't put it off till to-morrow," Murray overheard him say vehement- ly, and he conjectured that Mr Low- ther had suggested the postponement of the wedding until the next day. 

 Just then Button noticed Murray. 

 'Ton here." he said, in a most of- fensive tone. 

 "How are you." said Murray, keep- ing his temper with difficulty. 

 "AVhat do you want here?" said But- ton again. 

 'I believe I received an invitation.' 

 responded Murray, quietly, tho*ndi there was a dangerous look in his eves that did not escape the attention o( 

 Mr. Lowther. 

 "Ric1 ard." temo's'ratrd that gentle- 

 man. 

 "AVell. we don't want you and that's fiat." said Button, turning on his heel and walking away, followed by Mr. 

 Lowther. 

 Murray felt that it would do him v-o gcod to make a scene, so curbed hi� 

 tcugue, though he was simply boiling over with rage. 

 "Jack," he said to Lawson, who at that moment rejoined bim. "I've just had a little burst-up with Button, and will have to leave." 

 "Wait a moment, Rex," said Law- son. "I have just seen Miss Beryl again, and she tells me that she will get Margaret out through the back of the house, and we can meet her at the loot of the garden below the stable She said you would know the place by the sun-dial." 

 "I know," said Murray, his face light- ing up. He thought a moment. "I have it," he went on. "AVe shall make our adieus to the Lowthers ; this affair with Button will be our excuse, and we can ride round the hill and return to the spot you mention. There is a clump of trees close by that will screen m= fiom view." 

 "Right," said Lawson, and they turn- ed to meet Mr. Lowther. 

 I must apologise," he began, bieath lessl*,, but Mm lav cut his excus�s eh 011 

 "Don't mention it, Mr Lowthei 

 he said, duly "Mi Lawson and I aie just gring " 

 Alt Lowthei could not lestiain the look of relief that spiead ovei Ins faee but still he felt it incumbent on him to expostulate 

 'A ou mustn't pa\\ anv heed to what Button said ' he said to Mun IV 'He is natiiinllv annov^d at Mi Aldville not ai living Put vouiself in Ins place " 

 'I shall tiv to " isaid Munav emtr maticallv ' Sav eood bvc to Mis Low thei foi us A on can explain " and thev shook hands with Mi Low thet

 led down through the orchard from 

 the house. 

 An hour, two hours, three hours, passed slowly, and still there wag nu sign ot Margaret, i..id still Murray stuck doggedly to Ins post. 

 "I'll see this through," was all Law- son could get out of him. 

 Finally, about half-past seven, when already the shadows of night were clos- ing in, two cloaked figures caine swiftly down the hill and stopped at the sundial. 

 "At last," exclaimed Murray, and he left the thicket and vaulted over the fence. 

 "Margaret," he cried, and in an- other instant Murray held in his arms the girl he loved. 

 "Rex, Rex," was all that Margaret said, but it was all-sufficient. 

 Just then o cry of alarm from Beryl recalled them to a sense of their danger, and, looking up, they saw Mr. Lowther and Button at the top of the path. Clearly not a moment was to be lost.

 "WV can't face that " sai 1 Lawson motioning towards the Im. of fldine 

 Murray moistened his parched lips. "Must we give uph" he said with a glance back along the road, along which he momentarily expected to see Button and his companions make their appear- 

 ance. 

 "There's that pool in the oreen, said Lawson doubtfully, "but it's a toss up if we can make it." 

 "But the fire is already past the road 

 to the hut." 

 "I don't mean by the road," replied Lawson. "Leave me horses and go straight down through the scrub." 

 "Leave the horses," �aid .Mur- ray, his face falling as he realised what Lawson meant. To abandon the horses meant certain death if they fail- ed to reach the protection of the pool. He hesitated about taking the risk, but Margaret now interposed 

 "Do you think we can got there P" she asked Lawson. 

 "I think so," said Lawson after a moment's hesitation, the meaning of which was not lost on Margaret. 

 "Well," she 6aid, "you need have no fear on niy account. I'm used to scrambling up and down these hills, fio come on, Rex." 

 They dismounted from their frighten- ed horses and plunged into the scrub. 

 Murray could remember but little af- terwards of that wild scramble through thicklv interlaced bushes, but slipping and falling, bruised and breathless, thev somehow made their way through to the bed of the creet. 

 The roar of the fire grew louder and louder, and as it rapidly approached t he heat grew so intense that they wore finally compelled to take refuge in the pool. AU this time they had been in virtual darkness, but just then Lawson perceived that they were not alone m the pool, and he made his way along. The trees on the edge of the creek suddenly burst into flame, making vis- ible two forms in the pool at a dozen feet from lum, one of which he in- stantly recognised as Roy. 

 "Is that you, Roy?" he exclaimed, the relief he felt manifest in his voice. "Glad to see you " 

 Just then a blazing branch lit up tho features of Roy's companion, a middle-aged man in unmistakably cleri- cal garb. 

 "I've got bim, Jack," said Roy. 

 "Got who?" said Lawson, astonished. "The parson," replit-d the boy, tri- umphantly. 

 "What !" exclaimed Lawson. 

 "Ares," said a quiet voice. "The boy undoubtedly got rae, as he terms it. And after luring me to a hut by a tale of distress, lie locks the door on me and keeps me there until the fire fias changed the position and made us both prisoners." He laughed a little. "And I really would like an explana- 

 tion." 

 "I must apologise for the boy," said Lawson, across whose mind a Budden vivid idea had passed. "Let me ex- plain," and while the fire raged round them, Lawson related shortly what thev 

 had done. 

 "And now I want you to do your part," he concluded. 

 "My part," said the clergyman in a surprised tone. 

 "Yes." said Lawson : "marry them now, otherwise Button will return when the fire passes, and it is nearly over now, and-" he left the sentence un- 

 finished. 

 "I see," said Mr. Melville, thought- fully, a strange smile playing over his face. "Its a bit irregular, but-" 

 "You consent," snid Lawson, putting out his hand impulsively. "Good busi- ness," and he shook the minister's hand warmly. 

 "Hooray !" said Roy. 

 "Yes. I consent," said the clergyman, "provided Miss Lowther confirms what you have told me." 

 "That's all right," said Lawson. "Come on," and the three waded over to where Margaret and Murray were statior-ed, just in time to hear Mur- ray say: "It's a sad ending to what should have been your wedding day, Margaret." 

 "What will be your wedding �"ay. Miss Margaret." Lawson interposed. .Let me introduce you to the Rev. Mr. 

 Melville. Rex." 

 He paused a moment to let that an- nouncement take effect and went on. 

 "And Roy and I are readv to act as best man and bridesmaid," at which Roy giggled. 

 Mnrrav looked from one to another in amazement, and then at Margaret, who blushed and bid her face on his shoul- 

 der. 

 "Are you willing, sweetheart ?" he whispered, and he alone heard her faint reply. 

 It was a wedding undo*- cifio'is roii ditions that took place a few minutes later, a wedding; widelv different troin anything that Marenret could over hav�> itnagined. but though one pud all who tcok part in it were splashed with mud from head to foot, the ceremony did not lack a certain solemnity.
