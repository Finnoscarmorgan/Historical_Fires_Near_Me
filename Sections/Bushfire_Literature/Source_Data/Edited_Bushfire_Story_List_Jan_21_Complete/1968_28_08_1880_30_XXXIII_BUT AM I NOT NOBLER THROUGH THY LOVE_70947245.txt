AK OPEE" VERDICT. 

 BY MIBS M. E. BRADDON. 

 CHAPTER XXXIII.-BUT AM I NOT NOBLES, ! THBOUGH THY LOVE ? 

 , Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer and their -ward -went baok to Little Yafford on the same day that saw Sir Kenrick's departure from Southampton, in tho Peninsular and Oriental steamer. The parting between tho betrothed lovers was more serions than sentimental. Beatrix was touched by Ken rick's devotion, and grateful for his confidence, and there was a grave tenderness in her manner at parting which made him very happy, for it seemed to him tho promise of a warm feeling in the future. ??< 

 ; " You will think of mo sometimes while I am away ?" he said. - . 

 " Yes. You will bo; serving your country. I shall honour you for that." 

 " If there is no war I shall sell out ten months hence, and be with you before tho year is out. But if war should break out-and there is always some trouble cooking in tho witches* caldron of Indian politios-it may bo longor before wo meet. You will not forgot mo, Beatrix P Your feelings I will not change-if our separation should bo 

 longor than wo anticipate P" 

 " I have given you my promise," she said, with a noblo simplicity that impressed him doeply. " If you were to bo away ton years instead ot ono year there would bo no difference I should not break my word." 

 " And yon would remember-and lovo me ?" ho urged. , ". � 

 "I have not promised to love you," sho ' answered. " I have only promised to bo your , wife." . ' 

 ' "Ah," he sighed, "that is different, is it not? WeU, dearest, tho lovo must be won somehow. Perhaps if there is some hard fighting, and I como homo with one arm the less and a captaincy; you will think more of me. I shall think of you when I am storming a fort-if there should be any forts to storm." , ' '. . 

 Then he took her in his arms, kissed the palo brow and tremulous lips, and gave her his farewell blessing ; and so left her, full of hope. There never was a man born who doubted his power to 

 win a woman's love. 

 The Vicar and his wife were both anxious that ' Beatrix Bhould remain at tho Vicarage, but Bea- , trix had made up her mind that she ought to go back to the Water House. Tho old servants were all there ; nothing had boen altered since her 

 father's death. 

 *' I shall be tranquil and happy there," she 

 argued, when Mrs. Dulcimer tried to persuade her ? that she would be miserable. " I shall have my books, and piano, and shall worir hard, and I shall be free to come and see you as often as you oar� 

 to have me." 

 " That would be always," exclaimed Mrs. Dul cimer, who had been rapturously fond of Beatrix 

 ever since the success of her matrimonial scheme.^ *' But, my lovo, you could not possibly live alone. People would talk." 

 Beatrix shuddered. Young as she was, she had had bitter oxperience of the power of evil tongues. .,: 

 '* I suppose I must have what Thackery calls a shoop-dog," she said. "As I have outgrown my govorness I must have a companion. Would not Bella do?" ,' 

 " No, dear, she is not old enough. It would be just the same aB having no ono. It will be only for a year, remember, Beatrix. A year henpe you r will bo married and your own mistress." .,. 

 "If there is no war, and if Kenrick comes, 

 home." 

 " Wo will hope thero will bo no war. I shall be so proud and happy when I sea you- established 

 at Culverhouse Castle. It was my idea, you know, ? long ago, before you or Kenrick dreamed of such a thing. Clement would never have thought of it; but I saw from tho very first that you and Kenrick were made for each other." . . 

 Mrs. Dulcimer could not refrain from these little 

 Rushes of self-gratulation. This engagement of , Sir Kenrick's and the heiress was the first giand 

 BUCCCSS that had come out of all her niatch-mak- , ing. She had brought a good many couples to gether, occasionally for bettor, and often for 

 worso ; but she had never boforo mada such a : match as this. She folt as if tho whole thing wore her solo doing. She felt herself tho saviour of tho Culverhouse family. Whon tho mortgages came to bo paid, it was her work. 

 Beatrix answered not a word. She was always grave and silent when tho absent Konrick was talked about. Her heart could not respond to 

 Mrs. Dulcimer's raptures. She likod Kenrick, ; and believed him noblo and disinterested ; but 

 between such liking and glad, unreasoning love ; thoro is a wide gulf. 

 "Yes, my dear," pursued Mrs. Dulcimer, " If ? you aro obstinately bent on living at tho Water' House, you must have a person of middle ago for your companion." 

 " Then I should like a Frenchwoman who does not understand ono word of English," said Bea 

 trix. : . : r, 

 Sho had her reason for this strango desire. She ' remembered how Miss Scales's heart-or that pieoo 

 of mechanism which does duty for a heart in the;' i Scales tribe-had been set against her byth� slan- ? 

 derous gossip of Littlo Yafford. Hornow.com- , pnnion must be some ono who couldnot talk or be ' talked to. Tho knowledge of foroign tongues nt ? i Little Yu fiord was happily at a minimum. Boa- . 

 trix knew of no ono except Bella Soratohell who ?. i jould havo spoken half a dozen sentences in de 

 ' cont French. . s 

 "You would liko to improve yourself,in tho . languago P" said Mrs. Dulcimer. She always called . French " the laiiguiige." . "Well, doar, wo muBt i' put an advertisement in tho"TiMBS, but I'm afraid . it will bo diilloult to got tho superior kind of 

 personwe oould intruat you to. Of course we mqab stato, that unexceptional reference will be required;" 

 The advertisement appeared, and brought a .. shower of letters upon Mrs. Dulcimer, eriving oc 

 casion to much consultation between her and Beatrix, hut among thom all there was only ono letter that wave Beatrix an agreeable idea of tho writer. This came from a lady who had only inst como to England, a childless widow, whoso husband, a journalist, had lately died, and left her in reduced circumstances, and who had como tb London to try to make some use or her literary talents, only to find that literary talents wore a drug in the market. 

 Beatrix liked tho letter. The lady's references were satisfactory ; so, ^f ter a little timo lost in 

 negotiation, Madame Leonard was engaged, and | 

 in due course appeared at tho "Wator House. 

 Her appearance was not unpleasing to Beatrix. She was a little woman with light brown bair and dark brown eyes, small hands and feet. She was deeply dressed in black, and had the manners 

 of a lady. Since society insisted upon her having,) 

 a companion, Beatrix felt that sho could got on � as well'with Madame Leonard as with anybody else, and Madame Leonard, who was evidently of a' soft and affectionate nature, seemed delighted 

 with Beatrix. 

 And now tho Water House revived and bright ened a little, and cast off the gloomy mantle that had hung ovor it through tho last ten years of Christian Harefield's lifo. Mr.Jand Mrs. Dulcimer wore often thoro. Bella Scratchell came and went as she pleased. Mr. and Mrs. Scratchell wore in vited to dinner occasionally-a condescension on Miss Harefield's part which almost overcamo tho hard-worked lawyer's wife. It was a great priv ilege, no doubt, to visit at the Water House, but it involved fearful struggles beforehand in order to arrive at a toilet which would bo worthy of the occasion. Thoro was always something want ing, which it required all Bella'B ingenuity to sup ply ; and even when a happy result had boen ac complished, poor Mrs. Scratchell was not quito easy in her mind. She was so unaccustomed to dine out that she fancied some dreadful catas trophy must needs occur in her absence. Tho kitchen boiler might burst, or ono of the smaller children might tumble into tho fire, or scald him self with the kettle. That kettle was on Mrs. Scratchers mind all the evening, evon when sho was smiling her company smile and pretending to look at the engravings of Continental landscapes which Beatrix showed her aftor dinner. Even the . Bay of Naples oould not make her happy. "Ves 

 uvius reminded her too painfully of tho kitchen 

 boiler. 

 Beatrix found Madame Leonard a much moro pleasant companion than Miss Scales. She waB well read in her own language, and opened the wide world of classic and modern Fren oh litera ture to her pupil. Thoy read together for hours, each taking her turn at reading aloud, and occu pying herself in the interval with thoso delicate fancy works which women love. 

 Beatrix had-let light and air into her mother's long unused rooms, and ho,d taken possession of them for her own occupation. Nothing was dis turbed. The daughter respected every detail of the rooms in which her mother had lived. It was her delight to keep all things exaotly as Mrs. Hare 

 field had left them. 

 So life went on, smoothly enough. Beatrix had no friends but the Dulcimers and Scratchells. She carefully avoided all tho " best people" of Little Yafford, and received with a chilling re serve any advances that were mado to hor. To those whom sho happened to meet at the Vicarage she was coldly civil, and that was all. If tho Little Yafforditos were inclined to chango rhoir opinion about her, abo gave no encouragement to . any tardy gush of friendliness. She lived among 

 them, but was not of them. 

 Miss Coyney retained her original views of Miss Harefield's character. Although strictly conserv ative by profession, as became a lady of anoient family, Miss Coyney had that kind of radicalism whioh ' consists in detesting every ono botter off than herself. She cherished a savage hatred of Beatrix, considering it an injustico in tho distri bution of wealth and power that a young woman of twenty should have ton thousand a year and a fine old mansion at her solo disposal, while she, Dulcinea Coynoy, should be cabined, eribbed, and confined in a cottage hardly big enough for a dove-cote. True that tho cottage ivas pretty, and that Miss Coynoy was fond and proud of it ; but Bhe would have boon fonder and prouder of the Wator House. Then Mias Ooynoy's income, being of that strictly limited order which i endors tho outlay of every sixponco a matter demanding foresight and careful calculation, naturally trave rise to comparisons with tho revenue of Miss Harefield, which was large enough for tho wildest extravagance. 

 This sense of a wrong adjustment of fortune -together with tho fact of Mrs. Dulcirnor's de sertion-ranked in Miss Coyney's breast, and whereas other people in Littlo Yafford had left off talking or thinking about Christian Harefield's daughter, Miss Coyney continued to think about her, and took every convenient occasion of talk in.f?� 

 She was not evon inclined to let Miss Hare field's companion go free. She happened to meet Madame Leonard ono afternoon at tho house of Mrs. Soratchell, whom it was her custom to honour once or twice a year with a patronizing call. This was too good an opportunity to be lost. Miss Coynoy rather prided herself on her acquaintance with tho French language in which sho hud been thoroughly " grounded" fivo-and-forty y oars ago at| an expensive boarding-school. A good deal of.tho ground had given way during those forty five years, but Miss Coynoy did not know that. She was nob at all afraid of addressing Madame Leonard, who had boon carrying on a friendly conversation with Mrs. Scratchell, aided by alitble interpretation by Bolla. 

 Miss Coynoy contrived to leavo the Soratchell domicile in company with Madame Leonard. 

 Je ; march omi avoo vous BI, VOUS n'avess pas d' .objection/' began Miss Coyney, politely. 

 Madame 'Leonard ? doelared that' aho would be charmed; ravished;/, Hor naannei* implied that' 

 MisB �oyney*8 society was tho one delight that she had longed for over since her arrival m Little 

 Yafford. 

 " Comment est MademoiselleHarefield ?" asked Mies Coyney. .y: 

 Madame Leonard looked mystified;^ stupid person, evidently, Miss Coyney thought! 

 " Vous es la nouveau gouvernesso de mademoi selle, n'est ce pas?". :. ' *r ' ' . . 

 " Mais oui, madame, jo suis 8a dame de com pagnie." 

 " Comment est olleP Est :elle plus facile: 'dans 

 son esprit ?" . ... 

 Madame Leonard looked at a loss' to compre-, hend this question. , 

 "The woman doesn't understand her"' own lan 

 guage," thought Mies Coyney; " Ono\\bf j'those Swiss-Frenchwoman one hears'about, I dare say, who come from tho top of Mont Blane, arid call themselves natives of Paris." . 

 And then she proceeded to explain herself at moro length : 

 " Mademoiselle Harefield a ote terriblement cho qu�e par le mort de sa pore. Il mourissait sous des circonstances penibloment suspicieux. Les gens de cette village ont dit des peniblo ohosos sur son mort. Jo toujours desire, a penser le mieux touchant mes voisins, mais je confesse quo le mort de Monsieur Harefield otait troa suspi cieux. MademoiselleHarefield est tres richo. Je ne souhaite pas de mal a ello, mais elle est une jeune persono que je ne pouvais pas me justifier 

 en recevant dans mon maison. Mon maison oat 

 tres petit, mais mes principes sont fortement 

 fixes." 

 Thia French a la Stratford atto Bowe was quite incomprehensible to Madame Leonard, but she perceived dimly that Miss Coyney was not friendly. Sho bristled with indignation, and replied in a torrent of rapid words which might have been Chaldee for any comprehension Miss Coyney had of their meaning, but tho little woman's gestures told that worthy lady how much 

 sho had offended. 

 " Ah ! vous os uno temps serveur comme vos meilleurs," she oxclaimed, when tho French woman paused for breath. " Mademoiselle Hare field a beaucoup do monnaio. Cest assez pour voua. Mais quand vous laissez ello je vous promis que ce sera difficile pour vou3 a trouver une 

 situation." 

 And with thia assertion that Madame Leonard was a time-server like her bottera, and that she would findit difficult to getanother situation whon sho left Miss Harefield, Miss Coyney put up a brown holland parasol, which seemod mado ex pressly for virtuous poverty, �nd vanishod in a cloud of dust like an angry goddess. 

 � " But this woman is mad ! I comprehend not ono word what she says," exclaimed Madame Leonard, inwardly. " Who can have any thiner to say against that dear angol ? Sho is an envious, a malignant." 

 Tho warm hoarted little Frenchwoman had too much delicacy to speak of Miss Coyne'y's outburst of spite to Beatrix. She was puzzled by it, but in no wise influenced against her pupil, whom she 

 had taken to her heart. 

 CHAPTER XXXIV.-I ONLY LEARNED TO 

 DOUBT AT LAST. 

 Tho summer came in all its glory, a splendid summer for the wide airy corn fields, where tho lark sang high in a heaven of cloudless blue above the broad ripples of tawny gold ; a splendid sum 

 mer for Hyde Park and the green valley through 1 which Father Thames winda his silvern ribbon; a delicious summer for tho rich and prosperous in tho land, for whom sunshino means pleasure ; but a terrible summer for the overcrowded manufac 

 turing town of Bridford, where a hot season meant I fever an4 disease in its most malignant form. lu i tho seething boil-pot of those Bridford .alleys the 

 fair July weather brought endless sorrow and ! trouble ; and wherever tho trouble was worst and tho sorrow heaviest, Cyril Culverhouse was to be found. Night after night he was to bo soon mov 

 ing, quietly as a shadow, from house to house, to ! sit for an hour reading tho gospel to soino fover 

 parched sufferer whose dull oyes might never seo < another sunset. The days were not long enough ! for his work at this woeful time. Ho was obligod to give at least half his nights, and very often 

 the whole of them to his sad duties. 

 " If you don't take care, my dear follow, you'll 

 knock yourself up," remonstrated the port-winey j Vicar, shocked at his curate's hollow oyes and. 

 pale cheeks. "It's no uso sacrificing yourself in i this way. Wo'vo tho same thing every summer. 

 Tho thermometer and thc death rate go up to-1 

 gothor. Sanitary roform ia what we want, Oulvor houoe. Wo can do very little good." 

 " Wo can only do our duty," answored Cyril. 

 " I am not afraid of fever." 

 " Woll, ns a single man you can face it with leas scruple. I �should go a great deal more among theBO poor creatures, but Mrs. Rollings is dread fully nervous. She is so frightened about infec tion. With our large family we aro bound to bo careful. Even tho funerals make her anxious. She won't lot mo go near tho children after I've buried a fever case. It's a deplorable etate of tilinga." 

 Cyril faced theso deplorable things without fear or warning. What had ho to fear ? It was sucb work as his soul loved. To be where ho was most wanted, where tho sky was darkest and his little lamp could bo of most . avail-that was his idea of a parish priest's mission. 

 No heathena worshipping their wooden fetich in flowery islands of the fair south sena could bo f urthor away from tho light than theso lost Isheep of Israel, and it was to such as these he felt him self spooially sent. 

 And then for his ; Hf e. Like Hamlet, he val ued that at " a pin's foe." Ho would have asked no botter gift from the gods than to die doing his duty-a, soldier' of the Churoh Militant, struck down in hand to hand combat with .tho enemy. All things which make an earthly lot sweet and valuable to man were lost to thia man. He loved, 

 and: had renounced tho woman hclovod. Ho loved her atilt-moro dearly than ever in separa tion-and ho knew that 'sho waa to bo tho wife of another. Of fortuno or adyanoemont in lifo he 

 had no hopo. Tho olmroh j is a profession few 

 men would choose desiring either fortune br ad vancement. He had nothing to live "for but his duty, and it would bo sweeter to him to die for that than to go on living for it. 

 Every thought of Beatrix Harefield was pain ; most painful of all was the thought that sho would think him mean and cowardly for. his do feotion. If sho was innocent, she must scorn him.for his doubt of her. If sho was guilty, she must deem him a coward for refusing hor remorse the shelter of his love. He remembered those lines of Mooro's : 

 " Come.reat in thin bosom,'my own stricken door, 

 Though, tho bord hara fled from thee, thy .horne is still 

 hero." . 

 He had been like the herd, and had fled from his beloved in the day of her shadowed famo. He thought of his defection with deepest regret, yet it seemed to him that to have done otherwise would have been to palter with tho truth. 

 This burden of sad thought made him more desirous than another man would have been to loso his sense of individual pain in the sorrows of othors. Parish priests had gone among the poor of Bridford beforo Cyril's timo, but none with such a ready ear forthoir complaints. 

 There was a small household which had a pe culiar interest for Cyril. A widow and hor son occupied a wrotchod back-room in ono of the wretched houses in a blind alley-a festering lane shut from the air and light by tho overshadowing bulk of a huge factory, whereof the chimnoy, al though under legal covenant to consume its own smoke, rained ehowors of blacks upon the sur rounding neighbourhood, like the spray from a poronnial soot fountain. 

 Nothing could be more squalid than the house in which Mrs. Joyce and Emmanuel J�yco,-her son, lived. Their neighbours wcro no cloanor or tidier than tho rcst.of the community. There was the usual all-pervading odour of fried herrings and decaying cabbngo leavos. Tho back-yard, nine feet by six, wa3 a horror to stop tho nose at. Tho eye was offended by hideous sights, tho ear was outraged by foulest language, and yet in this leper-house there was one spot which tho infected air of the placo had not tainted. 

 MrB. Joyce and hor eon had contrived to impart neatness and order, and evon a certain respect ability, to tho one small back-room on the ground floor which constituted their house and homo. Very small were the means by which they had achieved this result, but tho result waa palpable to every oyo. 

 "It's well to be thom," said the mother of many children, poeriDg with longing eyes into tho neatly kept parlour. " If I had no children, I might make my place tidy; but where there's 

 children there's muck." 

 Emmanuel Joyce was a cobbler by trade. Now of all trades, perhaps cobbling is about one of the most unpleasant with which lo be brought into immediate contact; but Emmanuel, who paid his weekly rent punctually, and was in that res pect a striking exception, had obtained leave to eroct a small shed in tho angle of tho yard near his window. This shed waa looked at with en vious eyes by some of his fellow-lodgers, and talkod of invidiously as an encroachment ; but hero Emmanuel squatted at his work m all weath ers, and horo ho kept his tools, and those crip pled boots and shoes upon which ho exercised hiB healing art. 

 In the parlour ho had contrived to build a couple of inclosed beds on tho Scotch principle, which, though wanting in airiness, is certainly tidy and decont. At night a curtain divided tho one small room into two, and by day this curtain, drawn back and neatly looped up, made ono of the decor ations of tho neat parlour. A tall stand of flower pots, Emmanuel's dearest care, screened the loath someness of the yard, and made the ono window a bank of foliago and gay colour. Tho shabby odds and ends of furniture ahono with the baes wax and labour which Mrs. Joyco bestowed upon thom m the intervals of her plain sowing. Thero wero cheap prints on tho wall above tho mantel piece, and on each side of tho fire-placo there were tho deal shelves containing Emmanuel's much prized collection of books, all picked up at odd times from tho rubbish box of a second-hand book seller, and robound and furbished by Emmanuel's 

 own dexterous hands. 

 "My son is a groat reader," Mrs. Joyce said, proudly, during Cyril's first visit. "He keeps tho money other young men spend on beer to buy 

 books with." 

 Cyril went over to tho shelves and looked at tho books. Thoir oharacter told him more about Emmanuel Joyce's way of thinking than the mother would havo cared to toll. Thero was an old voluuio of Shelley, another of Keats, a Milton, and a Shakspearo. So much for tho poota. Thon carno Rousseau's Oon/esstons, in English, Tom Paine's Ago of Reason, and a dozen other books all moro or loss infidel in their ten dency. 

 V Your son goes to church, I hopop" said Cyril, 

 after he "had examined tho books. 

 Tho widow huug her hoad, and bogan to fidget with the corner of hor print apron. 

 " I'm sorry to say ho's no church-goor, sir. It's his only fault. Ho waa brought up vory strict, a littlo too strict, perhaps. "Wo wore chapel pooplo in my husband's lifetime and I think ho was a bit too hard on tho boy. It turned his stomach against religion, And now he's got hold of all sorts of queer idoas-and ho puts 'om into poetry. It's beautiful poetry to liston to-full of book loaming. My son reads it to mo of an ovening ; but it soars too high for mo sometimoo: I oan't quito follow tho ideas." 

 ? . " I should liko to have a littlo talk with your son," Baid Cyril. 

 : "Oh, sir, if you could but bring him to think hotter of his Maker, and his Maker's way of managing this world, it would bo a blesBod thing," exclaimed the widow. ^. That's all my son noods to make hun as perfect as any human creature over was upon this oarth. 'Ho's tho best of sons, ho's tho . honestest, soberest, industriousest of young men, .But it makes �mo shudder some times to hoar'him talk, that bold, as if he'd been up among tho stars and knew tho way they're (worked. I boliovo it all oomoB of too much loaming." ; 

 " Or too lifctlo," suggested Cyril. 

 ' "Oh, sir, you wouldn't any that,if you was to seo tho books he devours. Ho belongs to the Mechanics' Institute, and there isn't a learned book they're got that he hasn't gone right through.. He don't care for stories and such like. He calls them fiddle-faddle. But ho'll sit up half tho night over a learned book, and then ho puts his ideas into poetry." 

 Cyril was warmly interested. To begin with, a cobbler who read Keats and ' Shelley stood out prominently from tho ruck of cobblers It has 

 been Raid that cobblers, as men whoso.habits aro., sedentary and meditative, have a natural lean ing to infidel opinions ; but Cyril did not believe' this. Ho did not believe that meditation must needs engender doubt. He who wrote the di vinest work ever penned by an uninspired ,writer the Imitation of Christ," niusthavo been of all men the most meditative. And did not Bunyan's 

 twelve years of imprisonment in Bedford gaol, bear fruit in " The Pilgrim's Progress�," a book that has done moro to popularise Christianity than all the writings of all the bishops who over wore 

 lawn P Cyril could not seo any reason why cob- : bling and Christian bolief �hould be mcomp�t-'. 

 ible. . : "-""*; 

 . "I will call and see your son," ho said, Em-' manuel happening to be out of the way .on his: first visit. . . . . . '. . 

 Ho called the following evening, a dismal, rainy evening when ho �thought the cobbler, as a man 

 not given to Bpend his time in tap-rooms, likely . to bo at home. Nor WOB he disappointed. Em manuel Joyce was sitting at a little table, drawn close to the bank of flowers in the window, poring over a page of Carlyle's " Latter D*y Pamphlets," his elbow on the table, his thin hand entangled in his long hair, and with far�from a comfortable ex pression of countenance. ,:' 

 That Thomas Carlyle is a grand and noble writer noone who has ever road his " French Revolution, his " Life of Edward Stirling," and his ' Hero Wor ship" could have tho insolence to deny; but he is a writer demanding a oonniderab]o expenditure of brain power on tho part of his readers; and for a worker who has been sitting in a oramped posi tion all day mending shoos to find himself lost among tho Immensities, or vainly endeavouring to grapple with Phantasmal Captains, Inepti tudes, and other strange creatures, is hardly the 

 most refreshing form of mental solace after phy- . 

 sical labour. 

 Mrs. Joyce was sewing on tho other side of the little table, wasting her eyesight in ordor to'econ omise her candle Mother and son rose at Cyril's entrance, and the widow brought forward tho 

 be�t chair-a battered old easy-chair which her . son had neatly covered with bright-looking ohintz -for tho visitor. ' ; , 

 Emmanuel waa tad, thin, and pale, with hol low cheeks, and a projecting forehead undor which shone darkly bright eyes,largo and bulbous. His lips were thin, his chin indicated a firmness of character verging upon obstinacy. It was an in teresting face, but not altogether a pleasant one, Bave when the young man spoke to hiB mother, and then his countenance was lighted by a smile 

 which made it beautiful. 

 " Mother told me you'd been to see her, sir" ho said. "She took it very kindly that you should spare time to sit down and chat a'bit with her. Especially as you didn't leave a tract be 

 hind you." 

 "You don't like tracts," said Cyril, smiling tho energy with which the last sentence 

 spoken. '. 

 "I detost them." 

 " Yet I think the book you are reading is"some 

 thing in tho form of a tract," speculated Cyril, ; whose quick eyo had caught the title of Carlyle's 

 book. 

 " It is not a religious ti act, sir. It appeals to. man's highest faculties; it kindles all that is best and greatest in his soul ; but it does'not pelt him with Scripture texts, or toll him that he is by nature a reprobate and castaway, judgod andfore 

 doomed before ho was born." 

 " Bo you think tho Biblo tells a man that ?" 

 " Yes, sir, it does. Tho Bible texts that were flung at my hoad in my childhood and boyhood woro all to one purpose. They told me that I was a vessel of wrath, and that I was doomed to tho burning. When I was eighteen yoars of ago I began to think for myself." 

 "You began to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling ?" 

 " No, sir. I had read Shelley's ' Queen Mab' by that timo, and I had my own idoas of tho justice of my Creator. If Ho were just Ho would not create mo for misery either hero or, hereafter. And then 1 looked round me and saw a world that reeked with human misery and divine injus 

 tice." 

 "Stop!" cried Cyril, " Wore this world the end of . our lifo, tho clifieronce� in the fortunes of man kind might imply injustice in tho Ruler of this world; but the balance is to bo struck elsewhere; tho day of reckoning ie to come, when each man shall reap tho reward of his works, whether thoy bo good or evil." 

 "Am I to tako your word for all that?" asked Emmanuol, Ina projecting oyeR, shining with a floreo light. " You are like tho rosfc of them. Ono after another they have come to mo. Church of England, Wealoyans, Baptist, Rant er�-all with tho samo dogmatic assortions. My own souses toll mo that this world tooms with Buf fering and wrong. Am I to tako tho other story on hearsay?" 

 " Have you not Been something moro than suf fering and wrong?" argued Cyril. "Have you not Been that even in this brief mortal life-which true beliovers regard as but a .troubled passago to eternal pence-hnvu you not aeon that oven hero men reap as they huvo sown ? To tho sober man health and tranquility, to tho drunkard dis ease and early duath. To tho honest niau tho world'3 respect, to tho repr�balo tho deadly bur den of shiinur. This little room ,vo sit in bears tho evidence of your sober, industrious lifo. Whoro is tho injustice hero P Now and thou wo eeo a good man struggling with calamity-tried as Job was tried, ohnstenod aa David was chastened but his Btuuggles aro aa odwatioa for Heaven j 

 and could -wo bat se* rightly, we might regard him 

 as a chosen Hervant of Qod." 

 " And what of your hospitals for incurables, filled with beings only created to suffer ?" 

 "You hare never visited one of those hospitals, Or you would know that among those sufferers there are many whom Heaven has gifted with a patience that makes life almost happy, and a faith that fills even their hours of pain with hope.". 

 " Dreamers and enthusiasts," said Emmanuel. 

 " Among them are Bomo who have talents that make life interesting, or even genius that lifts them up above the common earth and creates for them a world of their own. We cannot measure our fellow-men's misery or happiness any more than we can measure the goodneds and justice of God. Some of the moBt unhappy of men are those to whom fortune has given all good things." 

 " What do you deduce from this ?" 

 . " That if we could know the hearts and minds of all men as God knows them we should not ac ens� our Maker of injustice. He has given us the highest o� all gifts-understanding and free will. It is for us to work out our redemption with 

 these." 

 " You believe infree-will?" asked Emmanuel., " A� I believe in God's justice." 

 ". My father was a Calvanist. He believed him self one of the elect, and his fellow-men, mostly, outside the pale." 

 " You were brought up in that gloomy faith the faith of that hard, good man who had love and mercy neither for himself nor his tellow-men, who put an honest woman in gaol for dancing at her kinsman's wedding, and condemned his old friend to the stake for differing in opinion with him. Well, I can hardly wonder that your mind has taken a distorted view of Christianity, for though a Calvinist may be a very good man, I doubt his being a pleasant man, or being ablo to make his faith sweet and pleasant to others. But if yon will accept Christ's Christianity for your guide, if you will look|to Christ's Heaven as your goal, you will find no thorns in your path." 

 And then, warming with his subject, Cyril spoke stronp-ly and earnestly of Gospel truth as he believed it-the pur� and unsophisticated teaching of Christ. Emmanuel Joyce listened and liked to hear, but his opinions were not to be shaken in an evening. He had too long cher ished and cosseted the demon of infidelity to be able to thrust the foul fiend out of doors at a mo ment's warning. 

 " Come whenever yon can spare an hour," ho Baid, when Cyril was going away. " I like to hoar yon talk." 

 " I will come as often as I can. But on one condition." 

 " Name it." 

 " That you come to church." 

 "I'll come to hear you preach. I'm nover above hearing a good preacher." 

 " Come, that you may loam to pray," answered Cyril. " Life is a barren waBto without that link between earth and Hoavon-tho Jaoob's Ladder of prayer, upon which angels�aro continually ascend ing and dosoending."
