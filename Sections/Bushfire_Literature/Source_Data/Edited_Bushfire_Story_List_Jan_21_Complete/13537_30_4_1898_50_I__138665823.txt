THE STORYTELLER.! 

 A LITTLE HOYDEN. 

 By JENNINGS CARMICHAEL* 

 CHAPTER I. 

 "You see the absurdity of it, my dear 

 children! How can one have paticnce with   

 a man who wants to buy a pig in a poke?" 

 The speaker was a girl of twenty summers,   her audience a lanky young emu and a whiskered, bellicose goat. The pair were her body-guard, and had grown so attached to each other that they were even fed and housed together, though "William" kept pace with "Mrs. Brown's" insatiable appetite with difficulty. Miss Ida Thorpe's pet   emu was named after a fashionable lady, who had chaperoned her during her brief 

 visit to Melbourne. Ida had soon wearied   of balls and races and afternoon teas, and   

 returned to her station home before the first month of her visit was over. Mrs. 

 Brown had then written to Thorpedale,   making all kinds of complaints, and giving 

 up the wilful debutante as a "a hopeless hoyden." 

 This report had got Miss Ida into   

 disgrace, and she had consequently taken   malcious pleasure in christening the emu, (caught for her hy the overseer) after her enemy, the bird's long neck and stately gait suggesting her aristocratic namesake. 

 "The coolness of the man!-to write to   papa without even having spoken to me in | his life! Of course, "Mrs. Brown,' I can! 

 look for 110 sympathy from you, and I fearj   

 the subject is out of 'William's' line." 

 Ida had invested her bird with Mrs.; Brown's individuality, as well as her name,   

 She was a wise emu, and devoted her energies-   

 to the business of appropriating every     

 thing swallowable within reach. 

 "He's coming to-morrow, 'Mrs. Brown,'   

 and papa says I am to behave myself, and I get a nice smirk ready to say, 'Thank you,   

 Mr. Escott, for your offer, which I joyfully   and gratefully accept!'" 

 Ida curved her lips into a mincing espression ] 

 , and regarded her pets with eyes that danced in mockery. But her audience were 

 not interested-"Wiliiam" curlod his tongue ! round a tuft of spring grass, while the emu '. picked viciously at a cast-off boot. 

 Ida Thorpe knelt on the dandelioned! grass and looked with wistful eyes across   the paddock to where the homestead chim   

 neys rose above the garden shrubs. There   had not been much in that country house to hallow it for her with the warmth of home. There hqd been no room indoors, 

 with a querulous invalid mother, and an   irritable father, for the high-spirited   daughter, who was their only and unwel come offspring. Richard Thorpe had 

 wanted a son, and the disappointment of   Ida's sex, together with his wife's ill-health, 

 had made him regard the child with coldness 

 from the first. Mrs. Thorpe was not   rich in maternal affection, and the 

 wretchedness of an invalid's existence after | her active, fashionable life, embittered ; 

 her.       

 "Take the little creature away!" she had sobbed when the tiny baby was placed in 

 her arms. So Ida was relegated to the care! of servants, her mother's sufferings lasting . 

 long enough to wean her entirely from the   little one, who grew in strength and beauty   as the mother faded and pined. In this   atmosphere Ida's disposition acquired -   

 perverse twist, which widened the breach     

 between her and her parents. To complete her ill-luck, the governess was a frosty and unlovable personage, her rigid discipline., unrelated by sympathy, rousing all the | rebel in the pupil's nature. Miss Murphy's 

 departure, alter Ida's eighteenth year,   was a joyful event, which the pupil coin memonited by naming the saturnine Magpie after her.   

 "Just as I'm having a real quiet time! this crops up," soliloquised Ida, looking into the blossoming wattle-tree over her head 

 with moody eyes. "Papa and mama have � not troubled their heads about me for ages! 

 How much I should like to give that young   man a bit of mny mind! 

 While Ida was talking filling about Mr. Fred Escott to her companions, that gentleman was smoking in the railway carriage bound for the nearest station to Thorpedale. He was young and handsome somewhat spoilt by a blase look and an air of bored resignation. Mr. Escott was ion a quest for' new sensations. He d grown tired of women's adalation, and the homag of societ.He was wary of the society girl with her calculating smile and mercenary affections 0nce -during Ida Thorpe's flying visit to town he had caught a disdainful glance from her, girlish eyes, and the look had Captivated him. 

 * "I have an idea I'could fall delightfully in love with that child he said to his 

 special chum. Charlie Frazer   

 "She looks" a 'thbrouehbred/ was his. friend's reply.; -       

 But when Eseott bad conquered his   

 indolence sufficiently "to seek an -introduction to   Miss Thorpe, Mrs:, 'Brown' informed him   that Ida had gone 'home preferring the company of cockatoos and , kangaroos to   civilised society.   

 "The girl shows excellent? taste, Mr. Escott had remarked with shrug, But   his interest in Mrs. Brown's debutante was   

 not-then sufficiently'strong to induce him 

 to make further efforts to know her. Thorpedale he learnt, was more than a hundred     miles away.Hec was not bored enough   to travel so far after a fresh attraction. 

 As time went on. Ida's careless glance persisted in haunting his memory. He fell 

 into the habit wondering how the grey, eyes would lookin various moods. He 

 pictured the angry and-tender, alluring and-, 

 repelling. Then he wrote that singular 

 letter to her farther, asking for an invitation 

 to the station and permission to pay his addresses to the daughter Mr. and 

 Mrs. Thorpe were as pleased as they were astonished, for Fredrick Escott was know to be wealthy and his family connections were good. No wonder Mr. Thorpe hastened to write a ststley but gratified invitation, and to deliver the first of a series of lectures to his daughter on the desirability of the match. Thank heaven! all those costly frocks 

 and things were not quite wasted. Mrs 

     

   

 Thorpe, had said as a supplement to the paternal 'oration. Ida's city finery was turned out, which she had locked up with so much satisfaction. She was ordered to put on a "decent" dress for dinner, and to give her golden-brown hair a littlie more   attention than the casual twist with which it was generally favoured. 

 "I'm not at all sure that I am not making a superlative idiot of myself," Mr. Escott reflected, knocking the ash from his cigar, and looking out on the wilderness of euealypts through which the train was passing. "The girl may have gone off, or may turn out ordinary and stupid. Just my luck if my little romance proves a frost!" Fred had planned his journey so as to arrive at Thorpedaie the day before lie was erj�ectedi "I want to surprise my little ladv iu a natural humour, though, of course, the father will not have been ass enough to tell her the object of my visit." But Mr. Thorpe h'ad thought it expedient to warn his daughter to be on her best   behaviour, unmindful of the contrariness of 

 her disposition. 

 Mr. Escott got out of the coach, which 

 had brought him on from the railway station, at one of the boundary fences.   

 "You'll find th' 'oushe, sir, oin't very fur, through them there wattles," the driver 

 shouted. 

 "Well, Miss Grey Eyes-you will have to be very charming to compensate for a twenty-mile drive in that rattletrap!" Fred remarked, straightening his stiffened limbs, and looking from the disappearing coach to his luggage, which had been turned on to the roadside. "It never struck me that two solid portmanteaux might prove inconvenient at this juncture. I'll leave them inside the fence, aud await   developments." 

 He had hoisted one bog successfully 

 over and was in the art of balancing the 

 other on the top rail when a treble voice remarked, "If you leave your luggage with the goat he'll look after it for the present.  

 The unexpected remark caused the young man to drop the portmanteau, while he 

 turned to meet the mischievous face and   mocking gaze of Miss Grey Eyes.   

 We are just returning from a walk," 

 said Ida, with a sweep of her arm towards 

 William' and "Mrs. Brown." "I presume   

 you are Mr. Escott, though we did   

 not expect you till to-iuorrow." 

 For a moment Fred's readv wit forsook   

 him. 

 , believe I have the pleasure of   addressing Miss Thorpe?" stammered Fred, baring his head. 

 Yes. I think I once saw you on the lawn at Fleming!. last Cup day,"     rejoined Ida, her voice taking a matter-of fact, uninterested tone. 

 "Would you mind calling your goat off?" 

 | interrupted Mr. Escott. 

 O! hes quite harmless," returned Ida. 

 That' s his way of loving you, and the     emu always arches her neck, and makes a   

 funny little noise." 

 Very interesting, I'm sure," stammered Fred, burstmg into a laugh which pulled him together. 

 "Please come to the homestead, and I'll   send a man for your luggage," said Miss   

 Thorpe. It is perfectly safe here, but   

 Wiliam will guard it if you like. He   

 and Mrs. Brown' make excellent watchdogs. 

 They are known as The Inseperables. 

 Fred's eyes demanded an explanation, so 

 Ida added- I called my bird after Mrs. Brown, the lady who used to take me to balls and things in Melbourne. No doubt you know her . 

 Yes I saw her a few days ago," laughed 

 Fred; and we were talking about you." 

 There is a slipt-rail a short distance a way; we could climb the fence but for my friends. 'William' has often tried, and once when I was in Melbourne his horns got stuck between the rails for two days. 

 If Mrs. Thorpe expected the stranger to   

 look sympathetic on the score of her favourites misadventure she was certainly 

 disappointed. As they followed the fence 

 to the opening Mr. Escott asked: 

 Do you often go about in these these pets of yours. 

 Always rejoiced Ida. "I have a lot of 

 birds at home, too, and three little wallabies in the fowl-yard. They ran out of a   

 bush fire, and were caught by one of the hands, so I called them 'Shadrach, Meshach, and bednego. 

 Mr. Escott laughed, while wishing he could work up an enthusiasm for dumb animals on the spot. 

 It was decided that the luggage should be ls eft till called for. On the way through the wattles to the house Mr. Escott glanced at the spirited little face by his side, and came to the conclusion that'"she was lovelier than ever." Ida was not very talkative, and addressed-most of her   remarks to "William," who persisted in   lagging behind to nibble the grass, or make tours among the budding tussocks. At last the iron gates of the drive were reached Allow me to welcome you to Thorpedale'" said Ida, turning to her companion with' a 

 sweeping bbw. 

 Do you mind finding your own wav to 

 the house? I am sure papa, and mama* will be delighted to see you.
