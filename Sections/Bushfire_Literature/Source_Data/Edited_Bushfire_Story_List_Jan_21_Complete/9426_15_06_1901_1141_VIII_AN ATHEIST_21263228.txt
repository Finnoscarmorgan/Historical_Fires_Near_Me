 THE STORY OF A SELECTION. 

 CHAPTER VIII.�An Atheist. 

 By ETHEL TURNER, Author of "The Story of a Baby," "Seven Little Australians," &c. 

 "Thou best made them equal onto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day." Hermie put her letter and all hopes of salvation into the kitchen fire. 

 Life was an endless drab again. She went listlessly out and stood on the doorstep to look at it. Her father did not want her, he had pushed his lunch aside, and bidden her irritably�he was so gentle�to leave him to himself. 'Bart, poor, grave little Bart, a man at fourteen, was working about the place. Neither he nor the young ones had gone to school while the father had been ill. He and Roly had been all the morning beat- ing monotonously at a bush fire just across the road. There was no excitement about it, there seemed little danger ; the fire turned quietly, steadily, it had been burn- ing for two days, but this morning it had crept to the fences ; the boys had been   obliged to cut boughs and beat at it. Roly sat on the fence most of the time and sleepily kept back the cunning yellow tongues from the patch Bart had entrust- ed to him. Bart walked up and down, mechanically threshing out the little lick- ing flames that longed to curl round the fence. Sometimes he left Roly on guard and went to do necessary work �feed the two calves, shed a buring tear over the dying sheep, give Tramby a few drops of water. Hermie went down to him wearily, a sun bonnet on her head. " There's no danger about the fire ?" She looked at it a little apathetically. " Oh, no ; if there were three of us we could put it all out. Roly's not much use, of course." " Bart, what are we going to do ? " For water ? Oh, Daly's going to let me have a big cask to-night ; you've got half a bucketful still, haven't you ? I didn't want to take Tramby out till it was cooler. R'minds me, I must mend the cart, that old shaft's smashed again." " And when that cask's gone ?" " Oh, I'll go and get some from old Perry �his well's not half dry, and there's only himself. But don't you go and be waste- ful, Herm �no washing clothes and that sort of waste."     " I want a bath, I want to turn on a tap and not have to use just a dipper or two, All Challis has to do is turn on a tap."! Hermie spoke with a strange bitterness. Bart smiled good-humouredly. "Yes, she's a lucky little beggar," he said. "My word, if I could have the bath water -she wastes, I'd make this poor old place look up a bit." He looked round on the desolate acres, looked at them with yearning affection ; he was a quiet-natured boy ; he did not call himself unhappy ; he would have felt he had nothing left to ask for had he but a plentiful water supply for the stock and crops, and better tools to work with, and a little mote strength in that young arm of his. Like his mother, he had the knack of doing the thing at hand with all his power, and already he was a far more proficient farmer than his father would ever be. " What are you going to do now ?" the girl asked as he hurried away. " I'll come with you if you like." Such a hot, patient young face his was, it smote her that she so seldom heeded him. He looked pleased at her faint show of interest.   He showed her the corn coming up bravely ; the wheat patch, not drooping quite as much as it might have done ; he pointed to the trees in the little orchard, � "In another month or two those apricots and peaches will be about ripe," he said. " Make a nice change, won't they ?" His eyes dwelt lovingly on the green small fruit. " When the drought breaks " " Pshaw !" said the girl. "Oh," the lad said cheerfully, "it will, one of these days ! then we'll go along grand." He had caught the spirit of pa- tience, of acceptance of ills, from the set- tlers about. " But the sheep�nothing will give them   life again !" The girl's eyes burned. The boy had no fortitude against this;     he gave a sudden wet glance towards the far end of the selection, " Let's go and see how they're getting   on," he said in a low tone. The girl rebelled. " No�why, ?" she said.   It only makes us miserable, and we can't   help."   "All right, you go back." Bart said. "I'll   have to go�l might have to light another fire."   Hermie followed him. The sheep crept away from the house to die, once they found no water was to be had there. They chose to lie down and cease to be at the spot where once had been, a dam. Patches of ashes showed where Bart had piled wood over the" poor carcases and burnt them up in his wise young knowledge that the air must be kept pure. None were dead to-day, though fifty   seemed dying. Half-a-dozen brown ragged little lambs filled the air with piteous out- cry. Hermie's heart swelled. " Can't you do anything?" she said. "No," he said, " they'll have to go." I've had to give, them up, dear. If I can get water for the house for the next week I'll be glad. Daly is running very short him- self." There were footsteps in the bush just near, a panting of breath, a curious drag- ging sound. " Floss," said Hermie, and remembered   for the first time she had not seen her little sister for hours. "Where can she have been ?" The child was dragging a bucket. Her   face was almost purple with the beat ; she had kept her eyes half closed to shut out the almost unendurable glare, and did not know she was so close to home till she tumbled almost into Bart's arms. When she saw Hermie there too she clung to the handle jealously. "It's not for the house," she said, " so ,     

 don't you think it. Let it alone, Bart� Bart, if you take it I'll scratch." Such a fierce little face it was. 

 " I'm only going to carry it for you, Chucks," Bart said ; " you shall do what you like with it." " True'n honour ?" "True and honour." The little girl relinquished her hold, but kept a guarding eye on the precious fluid. " Where'd you get it, old girl ?" Bart said. "Don't tell father?" "Why ever not ?" said Hermie. Floss turned on her vehemently. "I took it," she said ; "don't care�l'm glad. They've got a whole cask, the greedies, and lots of money, so they can get as much as they like. They get casks from the bore, and they're sent down in the train, and they've got a cart to fetch it. They drink it all themselves�pigs, they don't care about the sheep." "Not the Scotts, Floss,�you've not been stealing the poor Scotts' water ?" cried Hermie, aghast. The Scotts lived in a miserable hut on the adjoining selection, and were the nearest neighbours. Flossie's eyes blazed indignantly. "Them!" she said ; "they've got less than us. I got it from those mean measur- ing men." Hermie looked puzzled. > " She must mean that camp of surveyors down the road," Bart said ; " it's a mile away, at least. Why, you poor old Flossie, have you been right down to that camp for this little drop of water ?" He put his disengaged arm over her bony little shoulders. Floss caught her breath, and looked un- happily into the half-full bucket.     The first one was fuller," she said,   "but the s-sheep nearly knocked me down to g-get it, and they s-s-spllled it on the g-ground." Her voice shook with sorrow for the waste. "Twice !" muttered Bart. "She's been twice, Hermie." They were back among the sheep now, and Bart hardly knew -what to do with such a drop among so many. "This one,.said Floss; "look at it's poor eyes� and that one lying down�and     the little lamb,. Bertie." Bart put the bucket to the noses of the ones she touched, but had to drag it away before the poor things had half what they wanted. A piteous bleat went up from the others. "I�I think I'll just get one more." Floss       said, and almost staggered to the bucket. "It's quite easy to steal it now� the camp's left all by itself. Oh, I must get one more�look at that one's eyes." But Bart picked her up in his arms and started back to the house with her. " You'll just come and lie down quietly," he said. " I never saw anything like your face, you'll be ill like father. Poor little Floss, poor little old Floss !" "There�there would have been half a bucket more," said Floss, " only I nearly fell once, and it s-s�spilled." She was sobbing on his shoulder, sobbing heart brokenly, hard little Floss who never cried. Hermie took the child from her brother at the door. " I'll undress her and sponge her," she said ; " that will cool her a little; but I quite expect she will be ill like father Well, it is all Challis's fault." In an hour Floss lay asleep, the fierce heat of her cheeks a little faded, and Her- mie's hands were idle again. Miss Brown was helping Lizzie to fold the rags of clothes from the wash ; the father still begged to be left alone ; out side Bart and Roly still threshed monotonously at the fire. Hermie went into the tiny bedroom that had been run up for her because the house was too small�the bedroom that the mother had been so pleased to hear was built. She found herself looking in the glass at herself, looking sadly, listlessly. She saw a girl, thin, undeveloped, with a delicately cut face and shadows lying like inksmears beneath her eyes. Her womanhood was coming, and she had no strength to meet it ; at her age she ssould have rounded limbs and pleasing curves. She seemed to recognise this as she gazed unhappily at her angles. Her hair pleased her, for the sun was making a glory of it ; there was, a nameless beauty about her face that she recognised vaguely. " I shall never marry," she sobbed. " No one ever comes here but that heavy, stupid Norty. I shall be like Miss Browne in a few more years : I'm getting untidy now�no one can be tidy in clothes like these. I never care how I do my hair� what is the use when there is no one to see it ? I've not been to a party or a proper picnic, or a theatre, like the girls in the books, in all my life. I shouldn't know what to do if I did go to one. No, I shall grow just like Miss Browne, and it is all Challis's fault." A portrait of the sweet-faced girl player hung on the wall. Hermie tore it down from its place, and broke it into frag- ments. "I'm just tired to death of see- ing you smile," she muttered. Miss Browne came in, Miss Browne with perspiration on her face and a strand or two of her colourless hair loose. She carried an armful of Hermie's clothes from the wash. " They are a very bad colour," she said, " but we cannot blame Lizzie when there was next to no water�My dear, what is   the matter ?" Hermie did not even wipe the tears from her face ; she was sitting still, her hands on her knees and letting the salt drops trickle drearily down her cheeks. Miss Browne took a step twards her, then paused timidly. There had never been much intimacy or confidence between them ; Hermie with her innate love of   daintiness and beauty and the hardness of youth despised while she pitied the poor woman. " Is it�anything I can help�your father �Floss �you are anxious, worried ?" "Oh, no," said Hermie; "I wasn't thinking of any one but myself." She leaned her head back, and had a sense of pleasure in her rolling tears. " I suppose I'm not much more miserable than usual, but then I expect you are miserable � every one is, I think." " But not in the middle of the day, love," the lady help said. " Why not ?" " Oh," vaguely, " there isn't time as a 

 rule. One is so busy. It is a different thing when you go to bed." " What do you do, then ?" said Hermie, " when you are miserable in bed ?" Miss Browne thought for a second. " I think I say my prayers," she said. " And if that does not cure you ?" " I say them again." " And if you are still miserable ?" " I� think I go to sleep then�one is generally tired." She spoke apologetically. Hermie leaned her head still further back. "Saying prayers would not help me much," she said. "l am an atheist." " What ?" screamed Miss Browne. "An atheist," said Hermie. "It is very comfortable to be one. You have only to think about eating and sleeping. Oh, dear." She arose languidly and adminis- tered water to Miss Browne, who was gasp- ing alarmingly. " This room is hot," she said, "go and lie down in your own. You shouldn't have made me talk if you didn't want to hear things. Mind that bit of loose wood at the door." Miss Browne, thus dismissed, went away like a chidden child, but her eyes were full of terror, and her very knees trembled: She groped her way to the sitting-room, and poured out the frightful story into Mr. Cameron's ears. He made his own way presently to the hot, cramped bedroom. Hermie had let her hair down, and was sitting on the edge of the bed surveying her poor little pretti- nesses tragically in the looking-glass. Her father sat down on the bed beside her and disclaimed fatigue and headache, and everything else she urged upon him. "What is this Miss Browne tells me, little one?" he said, and almost indulgent- ly, so young, slight, and absurd she looked to be questioning eternity. Hermie twisted her wavy hair up into a hard, plain knot: " I only said I was an atheist," she said ; and her young lip quivered and her eyes grew wild. He put his arm round her. " How long have you been feeling like this, Childie ?" She burst into a passion of frightened   tears. " Since yesterday morning," she said. " Tell me about it," he whispered. She swallowed a few sobs.   " I'm tired of saying prayers ; nothing gets better, nothing comes. It�it's easy enough to believe in God if you live in Sydney, and have water laid on�and cool days, and money, and a mother. But out here�oh ! He can't expect us to to believe in Him." " I think a few of us do," he said. "Us !" she repeated. " You don't be-   lieve anything, do you, father ? I never heard you say a word. I have thought for long enough you were an atheist, too." He took his arm away, and moved to the little window�it was almost ten minutes before he turned round, and came back to her. " Child," he said, " sometimes I think my mistakes are too many for me. I have nothing to say to you. I dare not even say, forgive me. Poor little child to have come to such rocks�I should have helped you long ago. Only you see I had got in the habit of leaving these things to   mother."   " Mother did not often go to church," ' said Hermie discontentedly. " I don't re- member her talking religion much." She breathed it instead," he said : "she   is the best woman in the world�never for- get that, Hermie. When we were first married I was full of the young University       man's talk�brain at war with established     doctrines. She never came over weakly to me as some women might have done ; she never kept spotlessly aloof; indeed she conceded me freely many of my points. But she managed to make it plain to me that all these questions mattered very little. Christ and prayer and love and doing our best�those were her rocks, and the waves of dogma washing for ever on them could not move them." '"Did she ever read any of those books of yours�those on the top shelf ?" whis- pered Hermie. "Ah!" said Cameron, "you have been reading those, have you ? Oh; yes, she was never afraid to read anything that was written, but she distinguished between faith and creed. She said she did not try to explain or understand God, only to believe in Him. She is quite right. It is the hard names, the popular ortho- doxies, the iron creeds that take the soul and heart and warmth out of religion. When you were little she did nothing more than show you God as a Father to be te- derly loved and obeyed, and gone to for refuge and comfort. She never taught you your catechism, did she ?�before you were old enough to understand ?" "No," said Hermie. " No, it was her way. She wanted the love of God to be a living thing to you all �a glad, warm, spontaneous thing like the love you bore us, only deeper. She would have no lines and rules and analysis of it while you were small. It was not a thing she actually spoke about very often, for she held that the continual wearisome in- sistence of religious talk both in books and life had cheapened it, stifled the real spirit of it. "But white hours find room for themselves at times�on plain Mondays and Saturdays as often as on quiet Sun- days ; and she had a way of making the influence of them run, clear, fresh, plea- sant streams, through the mudflats of life. Can you realise in any degree what it is to me to find her daughter with such thoughts, Hermie ?" His voice was very low. Hermie pulled the pin from the plain, tight knob, and let all her hair hide her flushed face again. " If�if only I had known you thought like this," she muttered. " Yes," he said, " it is a thing I shall never be able to put away from my mind again that I did not let you know. A man gets in the way of keeping quiet things like these to himself, but I should not have forgotten I had children. I knew Miss Browne was a good woman whatever her faults, and I felt that I might leave you to her. Don't think I am ex- cusing myself." " It was not your fault, darling�darling," Hermie said, and clung to him. " But think how miserable we are, all of us, even poor little Floss. How can He forget us like this ?" 

 'Cameron's blue eyes looked out at the blue sky. " Not to understand, only to believe. He does not lead us always through green, pastures. The severe and daily discipline makes us shrink, no doubt. But we have to go on." " Oh, darling, I do love you, I do love you," wept the girl. " Tie up your hair, Childie, and we will go down and sit among the roses�if any are still alive. I am quite strong enough to walk." He opened the door and they went out to- gether, and neither looked at the sky. But here had gathered a brave cloud host, and there another contingent came, determined, black-browed, strenuously fighting the long-victorious sun, desperately clinging to- gether. And over the fainting earth flashed its lights, and through the heavens tore the sudden thunder of its guns. And the battle was to it. Down came the sweet torrents of the rain, and the cracked, piteous earth lay breathlessly glad and still beneath it. You heard the calves'- call to the mothers, the surprised whinny of the horses seeking shelter. You saw the cheep struggling to their feet and lapping the wet grass with swollen tongues. You heard the birds making all sorts of new little cries and noises as they flew wildly for shelter �birds many of them that had been, born and grown to make nests for themselves and never known the strange phenomenon of rain. You heard the hisses and splutters of the bush fires as the evil spirit went out of them. You saw a lad come up   from them, his beating bough still in his hand, the lines of his young, grave face all broken up, and the glad tears bursting out to meet the wall of rain that beat in his face. You saw a small girl rushing out half- dressed and heedless of the torrent for the exquisite pleasure of seeing the sheep drink. You saw a woman, with thin, blown hair, and a drab complexion, saying her prayers in her bedroom. Down where the roses were just recalled to life Hermie was clinging to her father, both wet through with the sweet, blinding rain. "Oh ! You didn't believe me, did you ?" she cried. "As if I could. As If I could. It was just that the dust had got into my heart and choked me. Oh ! darling, I never really meant that dreadful thing. Dearest, you don't think I meant it, do you ?" Her tears were gushing out in streams. �   " I never 'believed it for one moment," he said, and kissed her, and led her back to the house.
