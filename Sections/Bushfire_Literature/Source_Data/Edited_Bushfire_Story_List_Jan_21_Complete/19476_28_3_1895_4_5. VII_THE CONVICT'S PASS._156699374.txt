[By John Boyle O'Reilly.]\
BOOK FIFTH. THE VALLEY~OF THE VA88E. VII. The Convict's Pass.\
'That vapour looks like sraoko,' lie aid to tho convict clerk in the office ; ' what is it V ? It is smoke, sir,' said the man. ' This is the year for tho bush-fires.' Just then Mr. Wyville entered, and their meeting was cordial. Mr. Wyville who looked tired, said he had only an\
hoar'B writing to do, after which he wonld ride to Perth. He asked Hamerton to wait, and handed him some late English papers to pass the time. Hamerton soon tired of his reading, and having laid aside the paper, his eyes rested on Mr. Wyville, who was intently occupied, bending over his desk. Ha merton almost started with surprise at the change he observed in his appearance \'97 a change that was not easily apparent when the face was animated in conversa tion. When they sailed from England, Mr. Wyville's hair was as black as a raven ; but now, even across the room, Hamerton could see that it was streaked with white. Tho features, too, had grown thin, like those of a person who had suf fered in sickness. But when the hour had passed, and he raised his head and looked smilingly at Hamerton, it was the same striking face, and the same grand presence as of old. Still, Hamerton could not forget the change he had observed. ' Come,' he said, unable to conceal an unusual affectionate earnestness, ' lot us ride to Perth, and rest there \'97 you need rest.' ' Why, I never felt bettor,', answered Mr. Wyville, lightly ; ' and rest is rust to me, I never rest unless I am ill.' ' You will soon be ill if this continue.' Do you think so ?' and as he asked the question, Hamerton saw a strange light in his eye. 'Yes, I think you have overtaxed yourself lately. You are in danger of breaking down \'97 so you ought to rest.' Hamerton was puzzled to see him shake' his head sadly. ' No, no, I am too strong to break down. Death passes some people, you know ; and I am one of the \'97 fortunato.' Hamerton did not like the tone nor the mood. He had never seen him so before. He determined to hurry their departure. He walked out of the office and waited in the prison yard. Mr. Wy ville joined him in a few moments. ' I thought this smoke was only a sul try air,' ' Hamerton said : ' where does it come from ?' ' I think it comes from Bunbury dis trict ; a native runner from there says the bush is burning for a hundred miles in that direction.' - . ? '. Are lives lost in these fires ? A hun dred miles of flame is hard to picture in the mind.' ? Yes, some unlucky travellers and woodcutters are surrounded at times ; and the destruction of lower life, birds, animals, and reptiles is beyond computa tion.' ' Does not the fire leave a desert be hind ?' ' For a season only ; but it also leaves the earth clear for a new growth. The roots are not destroyed ; and when the rain' comes they bust forth with in creased beauty for the fertilizing passage of the flame.' By this time they were riding slowly toward Perth. The road was shaded with tall mahoganies, and the coolnes?\
was refreshing. Hamerton seized the opportunity of bringing up a subject that lay upon his mind. ' You gave me, sir,' he said, ' some documents in London which you wished me to keep until our arrival here, Shall not I return them to-morrow 7' Mr. Wyville rode on without answer ing. He had heard ; but tbe question had come unexpectedly. Hamerton re mained Bilent until lie spoke. ' Do not return them yet,' he said at length ; ' when we get back from our ride to the Vasse, then give them to me.' 1 ' When shall we start ?' 'In ten days. By that time my work will be fairly done ; and tho rest you spoke of may not come amiss.' ' Shall wo ride to Sheridan's settle ment V 'O no ; we go inland, to tLe head of the mountain rango. Those papers, by the way, in case anything should happen to me\'97 the sickness you fear, For in stance \'97 belong to ono whom wo may see before our return. In such a case, oh lreaking the outer envelope, you would find his natno. But I may say now, else you might be surprised here after, that be is a native bushman.' ' A native ! Would he understand 7' ' Yes ; he would understaud perfectly. He is my heir \'97 heirs generally under stand.' He was smiling as he spoke, evidently enjoying Hamerton's astonishment. ' Seriously, the package you hold con tains my will. It is registered in Lon don, and it bequeaths a ccrlaiu section of land in tho Vosso Mountains to the nativo chicf Te-muna-roa, nnd his heirs for over, as the lawyers say. We may see tho chief on our ride.' ' Then why not give him the package?' ' Becausc ho is a bnshman, and might be wronged. With two influeDtial persons, like you and Sheridan, to support his title, there would be no question raised. You see I compel you to bo my exe cutor.' ' Is he not tho grandfather of Koro, of whom she often spoke to mo 7' 'Yes,' sa:d Mr. Wyville, smiling, ' and also of Tepairn. This property will descend to them.' ' Are they with tho chief now ?' 'No; by this timo they havo reached Mr. Sheridan's happy valley, where it is\
pn bable they will remain. You sec, it is possible to step from the bush into civilization ; but it is not qnito so plea sant to step back into the bush \'97 espe- cially for girls. Ngarra-til, you observed, had no second thought on the subject ; he was a spearman again the moment he l\'84\'84 l\
The ride to Per'h was pleasantly passed m conversation : and, on their arrival, they ordered dinner to be served on the cool verandah. While waiting there, a rough-looking man approached and touched his hat to Mr. Wyville. ' Be you tho Comptroller-General ?' he asked. ' Yes.' ' Well, sir, here you see my ticket, and here's my full discharge. I want to leave the colony ; and I want a pass to King George's Sound, where I can find a ship going to Melbourne.' Mr. Wyville examined tho papers ; they were all right. The man had a right to the pass. He rose to enter the hotel to write it, holding the documents in his hand. 'You're not going to keep them papers, sir, be you 7' asked the man, in evident alarm. 'No,' said Mr. Wyville, looking closely at him ; ' but if I give yon a pass you do not need them.' ' Well, I'd rather keep them, sir ; I'd rather keep them, even if I don't get the pass.' ' Well, you shall have them,' said Mr. Wyville, rather surprised at tho fellow's manner. He entered the hotel and wrote the pass. But as the hand wrote, the mind turned over the man's words, dwelling on his last expression, that he would rather have his ticket-of-leave than take a pass from the Colony without it ; yet, in any other country, it was a proof of shame, not a safeguard. Tho man did not look stupid, tbough his words were eo. As Mr.- Wyville finished writing, he raised his head and saw Ngarra-jil watching him ns usual. He raised his finger slightly \'97 Ngarra-jil was beside him. A few words in the native tongue, spoken in a low tone, sent Ngarra-jil back to his bench, where he sat like an ebony figure t:ll he saw Mr. Wyville return to the verandah. He then rose and went out by another door. Mr. Wyville called the ex-convict to wards him till he stood in the strong lamplight. He spoke a few words to him, and gave him his papers and the pass. The man clumsily thanked him and went off. 'That's an ugly customer,' said Ham erton. 'I suppose you know it from his papers. He was strangely restless while you were writing bis pass.' Mr. Wyville did not answer, but he took hold of Hamertons arm, and pointed to a corner of the street where at the mom ent the man was passing under a lamp, walking hurriedly. Following him closely and silently strode a tall native with a spear. \{To be continued .)\cell \lastrow\row
