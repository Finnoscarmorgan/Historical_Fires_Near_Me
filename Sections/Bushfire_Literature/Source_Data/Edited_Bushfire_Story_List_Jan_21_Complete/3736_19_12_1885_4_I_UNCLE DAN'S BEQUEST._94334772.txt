 Uncle Dan's came had been, familiar to the whole family of the Ruasels in the old country long before they traversed the : briny ocean to make a home in the New I World. He was their mother's elder j brother, for whom she cherished many I loving memories ; and ' Rich Uncle Dan, in Australia,' had been a household legend of th^ir earliest years. But the Uncle Dan of reality, when he first visited 

 them in their little home in an Adelaide suburb, did not quite agree with the uncle of tradition. He vras a very old colonist, that they knew, and he was still a bachelor, and had lived on his farm up north so long, with only an ancient housekeeper to 1 do' for him, that true home life was un familiar to him, and time and rough work ing and rougher living had effected such alterations that even his own sister failed to recognise her brother when one day, a shoit time after the arrival of the family in the colony, he came to see them. This Uncle Dan ? This coarse, rough man their uncle ? His nephews and niece3 could scarcely credit the relationship. But by many a sign and token, by many a cherished memory, their mother recog niaed her brother, and was unfeignedly rejoiced to see him. Not more glad, indeed, than was he once more to behold the little * Lu' of his boyhood's recol lections. He would have taken the whole family off at once to his bush home, but at that time the father and his thres sons had obtained situations in Adelaide, and the eldest daughter had music pupils ; so that together they were able to maintain a pretty little home within tha bounds of civilisation ; and kind as was his invita tion, Uncle Dan's appearance savored so much of regions beyond those bounds that they elected to remain where they were. There was no question about it that their bachelor uncle had amassed wealth. Everybody who knew anything of Mr. Berville said that he had the talent of 

 making money wherever money was to be made in the safest way and with the least risk. What he did with the money so obtained, where he deposited his fortu nate gains, was a mystery to every one. Certainly he held no ace mnts in the Ade laide banks ; he had sunk no capital iu any company. He was eccentric to a de gree, professing little faith in either banks or companies. Moreover, he was not of a communicative disposition, he kept his own counsel but he was generous enough and always ready to give of his gold to any case of real need, and therefore, with all his reticence, was greatly esteemed. His sister's family had no cau3e to com plain of his lack of generosity whenever he came to see them, and their presence in Adelaide brought him far more fre quently from his bush home than his oldest friends ever remembered to have known him to leave it. It was something truly to have suddenly found a group of relations after so long an exile in a land with neither kith nor kin Dear him. He liked them all, and they soon became accustomed to his eccentri cities, and learnt to laugh good humoredly at his tirades against office work and quill-driving, and his eulogiums of country fife and country occupations. Uncle Dan was pleased with his brother-in-law, but he did not get along quite so well with him. The pale, quiet, gentlemanly man had very little in common with the some what ostentatiously rough bushman ; yet still, for his wife's sake aad for the sake of the children, and not a little with the view of befriending Uncle Dan himself by drawing him out of his seclusion and into a pleasant home circle, Mr. Bussel always gave him a warm welcome when ever he visited them. Months passed and all went pleasantly with the Russtl family. There were three sons, Ned, Arthur, and Bob � the eldest three and twenty, the youngestseventeen � and three daughters, ranging from nine teen to fourteen years of age ; all lively, active, and energetic, but, accastomed to life in the neighborhood of a city, having no proclivity f r a country lfe, in spite of Uncle Dan's continued laudations. But at last a shadow fell over the pleasant household, a time of special need aro3e, when their uncle, rough- mannered, rough- visaged, rough often of speech, came in with hearty sympathy and help, for the father of the family fell sick, and, after a wasting, lingering? illness, he died, leavinsr 

 his Borrowing widow not only the grief of her loss but in circumstances greatly changed by the want of his helping hand. What then would they have done with out Uncle Dan ? He tried once again to get his sister and the girls to break up the home and to make their home with him. But the mother's heart clung to her boys � she could not leave them behind her. She did not think it wise for them to throw up their, situations under present circumstances, and where they were she felt that she must be ; she and her chil dren must slill have a home together. So, though he deemed it folly and insisted that the boys could do far better at the plough-tail than at quill- driving, he made her an ample allowance, only stipulating to be still received whenever he came to town � to be considered one of the house hold, and if ever he should have the mis fortune to fall sick to be nursed back to health again. And to all this they gladly consented. ' Never mind, Lu '.' he exclaimed signi ficantly one day, with one of his mysterious winks, as he and his siatersattogetherover the fire after the others had gone to bed ; ' you don't care to go up country now, but mind you, if anything happens to me, you will have to go, and a good thing for you all too!' ,And Uncle Dan:chuckled to himself as -he rose up to take his departure for the night, as though .the hidden meaning of his words was* an excellent. jok 3. He little knew how soon something of that hidden meaning would be discovered, for to all appearance nothing seemed further than the possibility of anything happening to him, either sickness or death. 

 Stout and hale and strong, as loud voiced and hearty as ever, it seemed tohisnephewa and nieces the height of Improbability that anything could occurto alterthepositionof things ; and yet the end was near. He had come in from the country one fine and frosty day, for it was far in the ?winter, and though very cold was bright and clear. Apparently he was a3 strong and well as ever, though after a while he complained of fatigue and a slight headache, rather an unusual experience for him, as he said He remained at home with his sister and nieces instead of transacting the business he had especially come in to look after. He was very chat fcy not withstanding headache and fatigue, again expressing a strong desire to have them all settled at his farm, and offering to do the place thoroughly up for their recep tion and to make various improvements if they would only consent to the arrange ment. Mrs. Russel was rather struck by the extreme urgency of his manner, and began to think there must be some motive actuating him apart from mere desire for their company. Knowing her brother as she did, she could not believe that he would dtsire them to break up their snug little home, and her sons to throw up their, situations, unless the advantages were at least commensurate or far higher than they had yet. enjoyed. Might not his persistency signify something important to them all in the future disposition of his property 1 And in this case was it not possible that their continual refusal to leave town might prove detrimental to the interests of the children 1 Setting all this aside, was it not rather selfish of them to refuse to go and make what she shrewdly expected a very disorderly home comfortable for him ? 

 That very evening the question was i alarmingly put on one side. The whole ] family had gathered round the tableat tea � - a merry, lively, laughingparty � Uncle Dan j as 'jolly' as the rest, when he was suddenly i seized with a fit, and became immediately j '? unconscious. ; ' For hours he remained in the same con- ' dition, breathing, indeed, with stentorian force, but with eyes, and ears, and mind , all closed to passing objects. Thedoctora, ' though they held out no hope of recDvery \\ - but declared that he could only linger a few hours, and then the end must come, still asserted that he would probably have ? a gleam of consciousness at last, and in- | : timated that it would be better tosumuions ! Mr. Berville'a lawyer, as there might ba j J somelastitemtj communicate or directions ! ; to give. j ; The doctois Were r'ght ia their con- i , elusions � consciousness did return � a mere passing gleam indeed, but it was evident to all that there was an eager effort to say that whichthe poor paralysed ? lips had little power left to utter. He evidently recognised every one, and as his legal adviser came to his side and asked if there was anything more he wished done or any addition made to his will he simply pressed his hand, saying distinctly ' Ail right,' intimating that was all he had to do with him, but his eager glances were directed to his sister and her eldest son, as though there was something unsaid that he wished to say to them only, and when the doctor obsereing it asked it he should clear the room of all but these he nodded and slightly moved his hand. But, alas, tbe power of speech was almost gene, and while with failing grasp he clung to his sister's hand, with his eager eyes fixed on his nephew, the only distinct utterance he made was the single word ' Uhderneath !' the rest was unin telligible, and Uncle Dan passed away leaving his mystery unexplained and a world of perplexity behind him. The reading of that will, brief as it was, was a wonderful revelation of Uncle Dan's persistency, and a convincing proof that there were othtr revelations to be made which. at the last the tongue refused to utter. We know nothing of the technical language of the documents ; suffice it that ths legal announcement had simply to do with the section of land, the house, and all ' upon, within, and under ? neath it,' and that this property was left to his sister, to be divided equally among her children after her � with one proviso, that it should be at once occupied by the family, and in no case either sold, let, or leased during her lifetime, otherwise the whole of the land, house, and stock was to paes into the hands of a distant rela tive. And this was all. This was the solution of those words he had more than once uttered to his sister, notably so but a short period before his death � 'If anything happens to me you will have to go up to the country.' But what about the disposition of his money ? Everyone had reputed him rich � his lawyer told them that he must be so. But there were no banking accounts, no shares in any company, no rent rolls, and yet the question was not was Dan Berville a lich man, but what had he done with his wealth ? ' He certainly had something that he wished to reveal at the hist,' said the man of law after the will had been read, and everything made clear to the astonished legatee and her children. ' Was he able to give you any Idea of what he had done with the residue of his property V (No,' said Ned, in tones of great chagrin, for the disposition of the will displeased Mm, and he did not care for what he saw was inevitable � the throwing up a good situation and town pursuits for a couutry life. ' No, my uncle ua-. fortunately left his revelations too late if he had any to make. I can make nothing out of the solitary word he uttered � ' Underneath.' He said more, but it was not intelligible. ? Underneath ! I think if I were you, Mr. Bussel, I would work that word out till I found the solution. I would leave 510 stone unturned if the property were mine. At any rate, -as. the exigencies of the will require you to reside on the land, you will have excellent opportunity for solving the problem, for a problem it certainly is.' ' Do you think ? ?' said Ned eagerly, and paused as the legal gentleman rose to his feet, having already informed them of the course they would have to pursue and the necessity for their immediately taking possession of the property if they had made up their minds to agree to the terms of the will. ' Do I think V he replied smiling. 'Knowing what I do of your. late re spected uncle, I am sure he was a man of considerable we*'th ; and, con cluding from what he has repeatedly said to me of his lack of confidence in all banks and companies and speculations, � believe he has secreted his money some where upon his own land or in his house, and that circumstance made him so deter mined that you should occupy it. Bab for this sudden seizure and its rapid conclu sion I have no doubt he would have re vealed the hiding-place. As it is he evidently made an effort to do so at the last. You must make the best of that word '* Underneath,' my dear air, and, as I say, 'leave no stone unturned.' I (hall be happy to aid you at any time to the best of my ability.' ' What do you think of it, mother ?' said Ned when they were left to themselves in the liitle home, over which poor Uncle Dan's sudden death had thrown such a gloom. 'Do you think Mr. DeRue is right, that the last word uncle uttered is really a significant one V 'No, my son, I do not think so, though it may be. The two hundred pounds found in his pocket-book may be the only money he possessed ; and though it seems strange that he should have acquired the name of a wealthy man, if his farm and stock and section of land are all his possessions, yet we are not likely to obtain more, and I am content atid .grateful My poor brother,' she con tinued � her eyes filled up withteaw � 'he has been a true friend to us, Ned, and that last word of his may not alone have reference to money.' 'No,' said Wed thoughtfully; 'it may only refer to some paper or letter.' But in his own mind he determined on one thing � he would take the lawyer's advice and leave no stone unturned, so tar as he was concerned, to unravel the mystery. After that all was hurry and confusion. Sorrowfully enough the joung men gave due notice at their several placea of business of their intention to leave. Then came the packing of the furniture, the parting with friends, and all arrange ments for the exodus that was shortly to follow. Chapter II. � Taejsg Possession. A wide expanse of land with scarcely a tree upon it in any direction. In tbe distance a low, undulating line of hills, nowhere of any altitude. This only on one side of the section. Nothing inter vened between the earth and the sky on every other point of the compass, except ing, perhaps, a low sea of young mallee scrub, which moved to and fro with every breath of breeze that swept over it. The - veritable sea was indeed beyond, but only on bright days was the sheen of its i troubled waters visible, though the breezes were generally laden with the salt exhilara i ting ozone that betrayed its presence. : 'J he land was fenced, certainly, but the ; fences were old and in some places broken l down ; and green, and yellow, and grey i !; moss was growing in tufts here and there ; | upon the rugged, roughly-hewn posts and i i rails. Bound these the grass and herbage ; j had closely gathered, hiding the dry earth i j with their vivid green, a contrast to the i ! weather-beaten loss against which they [ j clustered 't . '^^.^^ ''' t ; In the :very. centre of rail' stood the - ! house, the: s-^le,i%nd bSin. A genuine - '. bushhouse,h;dtfeu{g3^heleast picturesque ! about it; ribJ tlirdrfr ^^hStl 'cHaNted ithe 

 rougbly-hewn logs of which it was com posed. The roof was of thatch, old and discolored, but thick and perfectly rain proof. The windows were of glass, cer tainly, but of diminutive eizo, ecaretdy large enough to allow the light to hti�I free entrance. Ihe chimneys (there were three of these deforming the exterior of the house) promised ample comfort and warmth 'within whatever they were with out. ' From the very top of these chimneys to the base of the erection there was no atom of artistic disposition visible � all was unmitigated ugliness.' So thought Laura RusaeJ, as after ' a long dreary day's travelling from. Adelaide, following slowly in the wake of a drayload of furniture, she at length arrived with her eldest brother aaa youngest sister at the ultimatum of their journey, and Btood in front of their u�ir home. Such a home! Such a contrast to their trim little suburban dwelling with its pretty garden of flowers and trees, both behind and before the house. Sh* had not been at all sanguine in her ex pectations. In fact, knowing what eh-d did of poor Uncle Dan, she had no pleasant anticipations ; but then, this ! ? Well, they had to make the best of it, that waB very certain. Here they were � there was the furniture, and mother and the rest of them had to follow in a day or two. There was nothing for it but to make the best of a bad bargain, and a very bad bargain it seemed to her at the best. ' Notvery promising-looking, Laurie, is it ?' said her brother, laughing as he came round to the side of the waggonette to assist her in dismounting, for she had made no effort to do so herself, feeling too entirely dispirited at the moment to exert herself in the slightest. Not so her sister Soph, a bright girl of fifteen, to whomany thiug of a change was delightful � she had sprung from her seat to the ground on their first arrival, and was in at the open door, and round at the back of the house, and out of sight before her sister even thought of alighting. ?Promising ! Why, Ked, if mother had only had half a suspicion of what she is coming to I do not believe she would have given it a second thought, in spite of the will. It's like burying oneself alive; it's putting oneself out of the world � an exodus with nothing at the end !' 1 Come, come, Laurie, that's too bad, we cannot be far out of the world when we are within a four-mile drive of a gocd township ; and 1 fancy too much work lies before us to make time pass slcwly,' said Ned, with a look at his hands, which were white and neatly kept, and another at the fresh furrows that bore the impress of a future harvest, but from which the newly sown wheat was at present scarcely visible. ' It will be burying alive, nevertheless,' insisted Laura gloomby ; * the work i3 not congenial, you know, and we are none of -us suited for it ; and for my part I don'c eee how we are going to make a living out of the land, or the stock either, with tha little knowledge we any of ua have. And such a house as there is !' And withherarms full of packages she followed her brother, who, with a large basket in one hand aad a tin box in the other � ' the provender,' as he Bhrewdly guessed � led the way to the open door of the house. Ihere was a welcome there at any rate, of one kind, for the evening was chilly and the mists were gathering, and 'a glorious burning log in the huge chasm of a chimney was no unpleasant object for the eyes to rest upon. Its warm glow certainly softened the rough unplastered walls and bare rafters, throwing a little life around, and giving a possible gleam of comfort to what at the best to Laura seemed very vmpronrBing. ' ? It was not unfurnished either, if the rude items of table and chairs and forms that were to be found in the rooms might be deemed as furnishing. A bachelor's plenishing, and that of the rudest kind, did not commend itself to Laura's nice notions, of household comfort, and 'she groaned inwardly as she Tapidly took aa inventory-of her new home and its- con tents. . ~ ?'?? ??' ' *J$ow, Laurie, take heart, my girl !' said her brother cheerily, coming in again with his arms laden, and covering the long deal table with his packages and baskets, ' ' things will wear a better aspect byand bye. Tou girls can soon brighten up everything within, and a little rain wid lay a green carpet without � so put on hearts of grace and turn to and help. I am sure our neighbor, old Mrs. Power, - has done her best to make things comfort able after her notion, and Soph has dis covered that the larder is by no means deficient, and there is an enormous stock of wood out at the back of the house, which promises well for the winter. Laura laid by her hat and wrap3 and began to gaze about her. It was .folly, '? the concluded, to look despondently upon what was inevitable. What they had now to do was to make the best of the in evitable, and Sophie coming in at the moment with her mother's rocking chair, her cheeks ruddy with her exercise and the crisp, sharp air, and her merry laugh ringing out pleasantly amidst the general chaos, the sisters begaa in concert and with something more like system to arrange the various consignments of furniture and household goods that came crowding upon them. * Six rooms with the kitchen, and all so roughly built! What did Uncle Dan want with so many rooms ?' thought Laura, as Sophie, who had already made the discovery, led the way from one to another. Only three of these contained even a pretence of furniture, the other three were entirely empty, though in the best of these another bright fire was glow ing. ' Mother's room and yours, Laurie,1 Eaid Sophie, 'it is the best in the house, not excepting even the sitting-room. We can make it look snug and comfortable � at least pretty snug and comfortable as things go,' she added, with another look at the rafters and rough walls. * We had better both of us sleep here to-night ; so Ned must put up the bedstead first thing.1 ' The first thing will be to see about get ting some tea,' said Laura, decidedly. ? ' 1 he dray will soon be unloaded, and Ned and the man will be ready for that . before we are ready for them.9 ' The water is boiling, at any rate/ said Sophie gaily. ' We will clear the table of the packages and spread a cloth. I know whereto find teacups and saucers, without unpacking our own china ones too; -not those ugly things Uncle Dan used ia com mon, but regular dainty ones. I ferreted them out in a dark cupboard and won- ; dered however he got possession of them.' By the time the last item of furniture was unloaded and Ned and the man came into the lighted room a glorious spread awaited them. Broiled ham, generous slices cut from one of a fine store in Uncle Dan's kitchen; eggs, fresh from their own fowls, as Mrs. Power had assured them ; a steaming pot of tea, of rather huge proportions, and slightly out of character with the delicate china Sophiehadbeensodelightedtofind; butter, sweet and fresh, the produce of the cows on the farm; and these added to the various condiments and edibles from the caskets they had brought with them proved an irresistible temptation to hungry men and no contemptible incite ment to even Laura's appetite. The splendid fire, the cheerfol light of their own lamp and especially the sub stantial tea of which they had all amply partaken, had a wonderful effect in'clear isg the gloom from Laura's brow, and making the unpromising aspect, of things in general look a little brighter; and : .- . when at last, after arrangements had been concluded for the night's sleeping, after the man had departed in his dray for the Nearest township, and Sophie, wearied out . : by her unwonted exertions and exube rant Bpirits, was soundly asleep, the brother and sister sat long before the fire discuss 1 ing their future prospects, but more than 

 all the strange manner of Uncle Dan's bequest. - ' ' . . LookiDg round the old house, so pnmi tfvein its construction, so entirely diffe rent to anything they had ever seen, for none of the family since their arrival in the colony had been more than ten miles out of Adelaide, it was difficult to imagine why their uncle should desire to force them into an uncongenial atyle of life, however fondly he might regard it him self. * There must have been a deeper reason for it than the mere wish that we should cccupy this place, and leave a decent position in Adelaide to take up a life we none of us in the least understand or are fitted for,' said Ned thoughtfully. ' If he had merely wanted to ensure a home for mother atd you girls, to have placed you in comfortable circumstances beyond the Ijossibility of want, he rnignt have airanged nil ihat by allowing the sale of tue property and controlling its disposition by will She might have bought a'house in .r -3e!aide and jet had a handsome sur p us over, on the interest of which she could have Jived with our help. But depend uyon it, .Laurie, that was not hia idea, tie �vas rich� that every one de clares � bat he was also reticent, and kept his own counsel. No one would have called him a wealthy man as the owner of this farm only, however ; and for my part I believe the old lawyer is right, and that there is money Becreted somewhere on the premises ; the only question is � Wcere ?' * 1 have no such hope. I believe, Ned, you will be most grievously disappointed, '- said Laura despondently. ' I only wish that Uncle Dan was alive and well, and that everything was going on as before. It's a good thing for you that the land is ploughed and the hay coming on, and the wheat in and springing ; but how you and the boys, with no knowledge of stock, of cows, and horses, will get on with farm work ; or how Min, and Soph, and I, with our utter ignorance of country em ployments or dairy produce, beyond the eating of it, will manage to turnout decent butter or cheese, I cannot imagine ' Ned laughed heartily. After all, he and his sister Sophie were the most sanguine of the family, and were the most disposed to make the best of the matter. ' We are ture to make some ' mulls' at first, my dear girl,' he returned, still, laughing. 'I won't promise to like all your bread, cr your butter either, Laurie, iut we can all of us learn, and there is such a thing as getting help, you in your dairy, and we on the farm � indeed, we could not wcrk the concern without it, or make the thing pay eke. But I shall keep the main idea in view. Uncle Dan's last words will stick to me like a leech. You must be contented with considerable uptumings every now and then � just as the fit takes me, Laura, for I am more and more convinced that poor Uncle Dan meant to reveal his secret hoard when his power to reveal had gone. 1 shall never forget the eager glance of his eyes that he fixed upon me. I am bound to discover the meaning of that look. * But I fail to see the motive of such con cealment,' eaid Laura; 'it reads more like a chapter in a romance ; and yet, of all men, Uncle Dau was the last on* could accuse of having romantic tendencies.' * Oh, the motive is clear enough. He was of a suspicious reserved nature, that was easy to see. He doubted everybody's motive,' he distrusted the integrity of people in general, of business men in par ticular. .Living so long by- himself, . and with no one to care for but himself till we came, he had got into a distrustful groove atd had grown miserly, a groove out of which he round it difficult to emerge.' ' But he was kind, very kind and generous to mother aad to U3 all, Ned,' Eaid Laura, the tears coming into her eyes, 'and if he had only lived a little longer I believe a great deal of his suspicions would have vanished.' ' Of courae they wouldjj, /especially with regard to us. But tliati-^tBe; .thing � he was taken off so suddenly. ' Perhaps if mother had consented to have come up here to keep house for him he might have coiiftded in her. I believe,' he added, * springing upasif anewthoughthadstruck him, 'I believe that is what he wanted. It would have been all right then, no difficulty at all. Poor uncle, it must have bten a great disappointment to him ttut we all hung off, and would have nothing to do with the country. But then we were none of us of the kind to wait for 'dead men's shoes.' I should despise myself if it had been otherwise. He must have seen tbat, at any rate, and it ought to have made him less distrustful. I believe it -did, too.' 'All this is small comfort now,' said Laura ; 'here we are � and it's a wretched place to be in. Of course the farm and the property upon it is worth possessing, but in my opinion it does not compensate for the exile from all we like, i don't know what mother or Min will think of it.' 'Oh, mother's sensible, she will not grumble if you don't, Laurie,' said Ned. ' It's a rough place to be sure, and living by himself, Uncle Dan does not appear to have troubled to improve it, but we can make it more comfortable. It's our own, we can improve as we like ; and I dare say we shall do very well and like it bet ter after a while. Besides, by-and-bye we shall come upon the ' old stocking,' ' he addt d with a laugh. ' Depend upon it I shall never give up the search till I find it.' And he locked the outer door, and raking the fire together, as he had learnt was the orthodox thing to do, went off to bed. So did Laura, but not to sleep. She lay awake for hours watching the shadows atd the flickering firelight as it played among the blackened rafters and dark smoke-dried thatch above ; thinking, too of certain possibilities that now appeared to be lost by their sudden removal from Adelaide. They had only been possibilities, there ? had been nothing definite, only ' it might have been' had they remained in town. But this sudden separation had jevealed to. her that Andrew Ross had became a little more to her than she dreamt of in the days when she so fre quently saw him. He had been absent from Adelaide at the time of her uncle's ?death and their subsequent removal, travelling for the firm to which he belonged, and if he cared for her he had no chance now of telling her so. That was one of the consequences of Uncle Dan's odd will. It was not a little one to her. Money could never make up for the loss of love. But if he had loved her as the way he sought her society warranted her to believe he did would he allow this removal to interfere ? Would th-s love be worth hav ing tbat could not overcome such an ob stacle ? SShe did notthinkof that ; her only thought on the principle of the old adage 'Out of sight out of mind' was that he might easily forget her, and that if he did ehe could never be happy any where again. She closed her eyes at List and tried to shut out both the sight of the disagreeable surroundings and the still more disagree able thoughts that strove to banish sleep, and after a while the happy unconscious ness came and lasted till the sunshine shone in at a little side window and woke her to her duties and troubles again. Chapter HL � From the Pen to the Plough. From the pen to the plough ! Bather a suddentransition.OnethattoldonthedeU cate texture of the well -kept handsand em browned the complexion Bat what mattered that if the end were obtained ? And the end� what was that ? Not the flourishing of the crops already appearing above the brown aoil � not the patting in of others thatwerefor thefuture well-being of the farm�not the looking after stock or_ procuring good hands capable of doing bo. Nothing of the sort; for though 

 Edward had made up his mind to do the beet he could with the land � to endeavor to acquire the knowledge he lacked � lie had not in the least relinquished the one idea which rendered the giving up other prospects comparatively easy to him. They were all on the farm now � all but the second son, Arthur, and he was unable to resign his situation, having agreed for a certain period. He had no desire to do so, and even his mother ac knowledged the necessity for his remaining in town, though she very reluctantly left him behind when she followed her children to her new home. Notwithstanding Laura's confident de claration that her mother and Man would never be able to endure farm life or the rough house, they entered on their new existence with far less grumbling than even Ned had anticipated. Mother was sensible � he had not over-rated her powers ; and if things were a little rougher, a little more uncivilised than she had im agined, they were not so very much worse than those imaginings ; for from what she had gleaned from her brother himself � from what-she had seen of him since they arrived in the colony even from what she remembered of the old time� she ex pected to find neither much comfort nor artistic arrangement in poor Dan's home. There had been, even in his early days, so so much of the practical in everything he did or undertook, so little of the poetry of life in his nature, that rough and rude, and entirely devoid of the picturesque as the farm was� rShe was not disap pointed. She had little faith in either the lawyer's or her own children's idea of hidden wealth; and though she was sorry that the property had not been so willed that it could .have been sold, and other arrangements made more consonant with their desires and the character of their employments, she was glad to feel that by this bequest of Uncle Dan's she was entirely removed from a condition of de pendence, and that it was quite pDssible in time to make a pleasant home out of this nucleus of a dwelling. A garden and trees would wonderfully transform tb.9 exterior, as Minnie said, and ceiling and flooring and plastering would rectify much that was uncomfortable and dis pleasing to the eye within doors ; 'and all this without a very great deal of expense,' as Laura, who was still one of the disaf fected, more eageriy urged. If Mrs. Russel had one regret that more constantly intruded than any other it was that ehe had not acceded to her brother's repeated request and made his last days comfortable in his own home. Not that she had to accuse herself of want of affection. Uncle Pan had indeed for many months spent the greater part of his time in Adelaide with his sister, and she was glad to think that he had not died alone, but in the very midst of his rela tives, experiencing loving care to the last. But sometimes the question would occur to her whether if his evident desire had been accomplished his life might have been prolonged. The doctors said * No ;' but then, she argued, doctors were not always right. 'Whether right or wrong it was past re calling ; and now all that remained to them was to take up their new thread of life and weave it in with the rest. She was quite certain that her brother had desired nothing but good for herself and her children, and that he must have felt con vinced that in forcing them to take up a country life he was doing the very best he could for them according to his notions. Whether he was right in his actions w*s yet to be proved. Kind as . he had been it pained her that any wish of his should have been ungcatified. But for this there was no help now, and at least they were doing what he wished at last � one of his earnest desires had been accom plished. What more he had desired � and certainly there was some unspoken desire . in those wistful eye3 and that feeble clasping hand � they might perhaps discover some day � some letter or paper might-turn up Who could tell ? Mean while here they were upon the farm as he had determined. It was absolutely hers during her lifetime, and her children's after her ; a certain home and mainte nance, the amount of income, of course, depending on the proper management of the land and all upon it. And there the doubt crept in. Per fectly unused as they all were to the neces sary working of a farm, with no knowledge of country pursuits, and no great fancy for acquiring that knowledge, was it probable that farming would prove a success in their hands ? 'It must � we must make it succeed,' Ned exclaimed in his decided way. ' Here we are, and we are bound to do our best for our own sakes. The neighbors say that this land is good, only that Uncle Dan has not seemed to care so much about it lately � has not looked quite so well after it as he used to do. Well, Bob and I will have to learn a thing or two � a good many things, in fact ; and so will you, girls, if the dairy is to pay.' * It is not the learning, but the doing is the trouble,' said Minnie gravely. ? How ever, as you say, Ned, it has to be done ; and for my part I think it is as well to go about the work cheerfully if it is rather distasteful. I am glad at any rate that we have engaged a good stout girl who knows everything about a dairy, for I am afraid we should make poor work of the butter,' ehe added with a laugh. 'Live and learn,' answered her brother, stretching himself as if for future action. 4 Who knows, we may all become so attached to these country notions that we shall prefer them to town ' Early and late they went to work, both Ned and his young brother, quietly taking notes of the experienced hands they had been fortunate to obtain, and taking les Bons of their neighbors at the plough handle, practising between whiles with the axe chopping wood, though, they had ex perienced a little of this last work even in Adelaide, But Ned had not forgotten his 'one idea ' He went about all day in a pre-occupied manner, from which he was I every now and then obliged to pull liicn I self up. He had to do so to save appear i ances, if not for properly understanding ) the work he was engaged in. But early, j very early in the morning, before the farm j hands were stirring, and late at night when for the most part all were sleeping but himself he went prowling about look ; ing into holes and corners and turning up ; things generally, and all to little purpose, | as his sisters Min and Laura said. Bat ; Soph believed in her brother She waa always sure he was right, and right wil ; lingly helped him whenever he required i help. ) ' We shall find it some day when we : are not looking for it;' she said cheerfully \\ one evening when no results had as usual followed their efforts. ?I shall never leave off till I do, Soph !! replied Ned, aB he threw himself iuto a i a chair by the fire and gave over his search : for the time being. ' Believe me, I don'l ; throw up the hope so easily. There j must be money. That limb of the law j must be right jhemutthavereasonforthink ! ing as he does. It's only a little patience] j depend upon it, that is wanted ; we shall ! come upon the hoard some day. Bat if ? Uncle Dan had only suspected his kind s little less and trusted a little more what a a large amount of bother it would have saved !' 'Ah ! Maybe if he had foreseen the trouble � had he dreamt even of tha possi bility of his passing away � unable even to make a sign � he might have acted differently. A sit was his life had ended like an unfinished chapter ; the con clusion left to be wrought by other hands, or to remain unfinished.' After all, this house of Uncle Dan's waa no great matter for a search. There was nothing in it from which a romance could be drawn. There were no secret panels, no antiquated pieces of furniture, no trap doors. Little foundation to work upon for the discovery of a ''secret hb&rd.^ 'The whole place, room ^.by rodin'. :i^ight be thoroughly explorea^n^aaay|7e9 thought 

 Laura, who, being a great lover of order, c did not approve of Ned's exploring and i i uptnrnings, especially when they showed i c no sign of abatement. He had twice taken j i up the hearthstones in each of the rooms j f where chimneys existed, and we sadly i fear that the relaying of those stones was t not accomplished in a very workman like 1 manner. Bit by bit, foot by foot, he had j sounded the floors, hammered round the - walls, examined every morsel of the huge i chimneys, probed the very oven, as if that � were a likely place for the hoarding of i hidden wealth. These failing he had - climbed up into the rafters and tested the i blackened thatch in all directions to the i great discomfiture of certain large spiders, ] ?who, dislodged from their webby laira, ] created still greater annoyance and alarm ^ by falling among the young ladies below. j Such shrieks had never echoed from Uncle Dan'a home beiore or from such a cause. ' All in vain. There was nothing found� 1 no paper, no letter even, in any crevice, as the mother had suggested might i possibly be discovered. But Ned was un- ; wavering in his belief � he was not to be finally or easily baffled. He was off to the barns next, and j recollecting that word 'Underneath,' ?which, Booth to say in some of his re searches he had not much respected, he resolved to leave no stone unturned in either stable or barn. It was a more diflicult thing this, for he had no desire to awaken the suspicions of the men ; indeed, it was not easy to get to the bottom of everything, for Uncle Dan'3 barns were well filled, and the moving of all the stores they contained would not only have occasioned much labor and trouble, but inasmuch as it could not have been accomplished alone would as certainly have given rise to much gossip, ?which he was anxious to avoid. As it ?was one man was overheard saying to his mate � ' The yourq master's moighty partickler, he do make a lot of fuss over cleaning out of that there stable. No one can do it but hisself, spite of his white hands.' The white hands were, however, fast losing their whiteness in such service as this, and exposure to the air and to the ?wintry sunshine was removing all trace of delicacy from Ned's complexion. He was growing strong in the fresh ozone that came over the niallee scrub, which he breathed in day by day. fle felt its strengthening influence in every nerve, and as time wore on and this became more apparent his mother and sisters looked in astonishment at him. 'I do believe, Ned, that this sort of life suits you after all ; I never saw a greater change in anyone, and so soon too,' said Min, as seated at the early morning break fast (they had most of them to rise early now-a-days) she plied her brother's plate and poured out cups of coffee, wondering all the -while at the power of a few fresh breezes and a little exposure to them. ' Yes, if it were not for this mad craze of hiB I believe he would make a first-rate farmer after all,' Laura quietly added. She had not overcome her reluctance to a country life, and had no sympathy with any of its employments. 'In spite of the 'mad craze' I believe Minis right,3 replied Ned laugh ing. ' I am twice the man I was whilst bending over the desk in Adelaide ; and, as she suggests, I am beginning to like the work. As to the 'craze,' as you call it, Laura, it has all the excitement of j a chase. I like it because it is exciting, j and because I firmly believe the goal will ] be reached some day. You won't des- j pise the results then, my girl, however . askance you lock at them now.' j 'No, Ned; pardon. - I cannot look in ; any way at what has no existence except- j ing in your imagination,' replied Laura with an arch smile. ' But I am glad you are satisfied ; and if all does notgo well, and this farm-keeping is not a success, I can go , back to Adelaide, take up my music pupils j again, and keep house for Arthur. ' * 'Or for somebody else, minus the music pupils,' suggetted Ned mischievously. 'By-the-way, I wonder whether Ross has returned to Adelaide ; and if so, whether he has seen A rthur ? How non-plu8sed he will be to hear of our clean exodus ! He will miss our pleasant evenings, I fancy, 1 and feel very lonely � hey, Laurie ?' ; But Laura had pushed aside her cup, and responded to the call of Maggie, who opportunely appeared at that moment with a petition for help and directions. j ' Do you think Andy really cared for J Laurie ?' said Min meditatively. - ? It ; used to seem so, but I sometimes won- , dered that he never declared himself.' | ' Ah, that's nothing ! Fellows do hang off sometimes you know ; not because they would not like to make things certain, but from sheer cowardice,' replied Ned, raising his eyebrows and coloring slightly under his brown skin. ' I haven't a doubt that he cares for Laurie, and will find means to tell her so some day.' 'A fellow-feeling makes U3 wondrou3 kind,' laughed Min. 'I say, Ned, who is the young lady from whom you are holding off ? Do I know her ? or is there any young lady in the case ?' she saucily asked. 'Ah, my dear girl, all that is la the future for me !' he replied, springing up, 'and it will be still further distant if I do not try to make hay while the sun shines.' And whistling aloud a stave from a popular song, he thrust on his ' wide awake' and went off quickly in the direc tion of the barn. Chapter IV. � Cool Waters. Winttr wore on, bringing its fresh genial showers, abundantly fructifying and bearing rich promises for the future har vest. 'J he young corn sprang up visibly beneath its influence and that of the soft sunshine that followed. The ground that had looked so bare and uninviting when the Russels first came to the farm wore now a rich livery of green: ? Everywhere the earth was teeming with verdure, and the flowers only awaited the spring breezes and sunbeams to burst into beauty and fragrance. ?;=?-?? Gradually the Russels were becoming accustomed to their new life � accommo- dating themselves at any rate to its exigen cies. This as a matter of necessity. 'We must live' was a motto pretty generally accepted by them alL Work, however uncongenial it was, had to be done, and it was as well to make it as little burden some as possible. There had been some touches of im provement made to the old rough house � some of its roughnesses smoothed away out of sight, ceilings to some of the rooms, j plastertothe walls both within and without, j Very reluctantly had Ned seen the rafters ' covered and the crevices concealed, ;? though, he had searched them over and over again for the treasure he was still so certain existed, alas 1 without avail. Still the comfort of his mother demanded the ; concession, and in a short time a very diffe- ; rent looking house grew up around them, ] without any great expenditure ; and even the girls began to think a snug, and po3- , sibly a pretty, homestead might be made ] of the old bush-house. A small garden had already been fenced in and thickly planted with cuttings and roots, all of . which had taken kindly to the soil Seeds were rapidly making their appearance above ground; so that they promised them- j selves a pretty flower-garden in the future. ! In that future the fruit trees and vines were to stretch at the back of the house ; a hedge was to be planted, and a veran- , dah raised round the house itself, for ten drils and blossoms to climb. Much of this, however, was a pleasant little romance ; it would take the future, a good long future, fully to develop it. ; Still it was a romance that wonderfully ; smoothed out the present, and gave a ' brighter tint to the matter-of-fact sur roundings. Something else had reconciled Laura a little more to her lot. They had heard j from Arthur lately of Andrew Boss's ; return to Adelaide, and that the twb ' young men were continually in each other's 

 jompany. The very first evening after hia ?eturn (so said Arthur) Andrew had gone Jirectly to their old house, and was asto lished to find new tenants occupying the amiliar rooms. It was too late to go that light to Ned's office, but he went first ihing next morning, and there he earnt that the whole family had left and �one up the country. By mere chance he same upon Arthur in the street, and over ;heir luncheon he heard the whole itory. ' He was very down in the mouth, ' wrote Arthur. 'Perhaps Laurie can livine the reason. Of course, he said it kvas a great miss � the pleasant evening, she music and singing, and all that ; and [ fully agreed with him, but I have asked dim to spend Christmas with us, mother, when I come, as a bit of an amend ; aad [ suppose all hands will be agreeable.' Christmas ! It was a long way off yet �a long way to look forward to. But there was also a great deal to be done before that time of happy reunion that would help to make time appear Ie33 alow. But the hope of it, and the looking forward to it on both sides was something. A wonderful difference it made to Laura. They said the pure fresh air and the spring sunshine were doing her good. And so they doubtless were, but it was not all due to their influence. Arthur's letters had anew charm now � to her especially. There was always some little incident to relate, in which Andrew Boss had taken part � some message from that gentleman himself, which made those letters intensely interesting to her, though she tried hard to appear indifferent, and therefore sometimes rather over-acted her part. However, Christmas, like most good things, had to be waited for, with all that it might or might not bring ; and mean while there were household duties to per form and dainty cooking to do, for these were in her province. Min and Soph assisted in the dairy, which, with Maggie's valuable help, gave them full occupation, and was becoming daily more productive ; but it was her task to assist her mother, who was still a bright and active woman, spite of her sixty years. On them de volved all household comforts and the various in- door arrangements. The even ings were made pleasant and bright once more with music and singing, and it was no unusual thing for neighbors from Greg ville, the nearest township, where they were already finding friends, to drop in and enjoy their social pleasure with them. To Soph and her youngest brother, Bob, this change of lif e from the city to the full fresh air and free life of the country was delightful. There wa3 a charm to them in the very roughness, and they never gave a sigh even for the pretty house in the suburbs, where they were bound and restricted, and had a hundred con ventionalities to attend lo in exchange for all the prettiness. ' It was jolly,' as Soph said in her free and eaey chats with Bob ; 'regularly jolly to feed up on their own butter and cheese and bacon, to enjoy their own sweet milk fed pork, and sausages, such as were un known to the poor deluded denizens of Adelaide. Then the milk and cream, rich and not rare, but plentifully abun dant, and the tender chickens and eggs just freshly laid. It was something like living to enjoy all this, and poor Uncle Dan knew a thing or two when he in sisted upon their taking up this country life.' ' He was a brick, Soph ! I knew that all along, and it has turned out splen didly for mother, and splendidly for us too. I wouldn't be Arthur for something, f hut up in a musty, fusty old office this fine spring. I never did get on much with the desk, I always rebelled against it fine days, and longed to cut and run off among those glorious hills of which we used to get such tantalising views even from the very door of our office. But this out of doors work is fine, it suits me toaT!' ' I should think it did,' said Soph. 'It suits Ned too,' continued Bob. {I know he is beginning to like the life, and if he would only forget everything else it would be first-rate here. But of course while he is always on the search for what will never be found, he is hot likely to feel quite settled, you know. ' *Oh, but I don't say it will never be found,' said Soph, with a toss of her head. ' I believe in Ned ; he has good reasons for searching, no doubt ; and some day, perhaps, when he is least expecting, it will be found, whatever it is. Mark my words, Bob.' '-I would if I could only muster a bit of red chalk,' said Bob, with a saucy laugh. The brother and sister were slowly riding along over the soft green grass, each mounted on a rough shaggy pony with a mob of fine cowa and little lowing calves before them. It was early morning ; the sun had just thrown out its rays of glory over the low undulating line of hills, and was scattering the mists right and left as it gradually rose higher and higher in the heavens. It was a glorious morning, the air keen and fresh, yet warming every moment as the sun rose. Over the mallee scrub came the fresh breath of the ocean, which . like a tonic exhilarated with its essence. A bright, long line, quivering and dancing in the new sunbeams, be trayed the nearness of the ?' briny.' The green mallee, intermingled with lovely flowering shrubs, under the influence of those morning breezes, bent and swayed and curled like the veritable ocean waves. No wonder that amidst such scenes, and under such influences, country life and country employments seemed to the young Russels infinitely superior to town with all its amusements and excitements and society. Early as it was, the morning's milking was over, and they were now taking their charges to the waterhole, which was about a quarter of a mile from the house � a shallow waterhole, though a permanent one, made so by the presence of a fine spring, which chance only had discovered to 'Uncle Dan in years gone by. The dis covery had doubled the value of his land. Let who would cart water in dry seasons his spring had never failed, lo came up pure arid bubbling to the top, filling a small natural rocky basin, supplying the whole household with its sweet watera. It was only a wonder to the Russels that a house had not been erected at once on ifcs site, thus saving the necessity of carting for home consumption. Perhaps had Uncle Dan had a wife and family this would have been done. As it was the water had to be carried to the hou3e. The rest of the waters overflowed the top of the basin, making for themselves fresh channels. And here the thirsty cattle were refreshed and satiated. ' It is lovely down here,' said Soph taking off her hat and tossing her soft brown hair back from her sunburnt brow, as she watched her pony taking in full draughts of the limpid fluid. Down it certainly was � for the narrow road be tween the mallee scrub had gradually de scended till the stream itself stopped their progress, running rippling across their path There it was, right before them. On the other three sides the embankment rose high above their heads � almost per pendicularly. Here and there little morsels of flowering shrubs clung to the rough sides, throwing down garlands of leaves and flowers and tendrils, which in their turn clung closely to the projecting walk, and blossomed fearlessly as they clung. Over the tops of the em bankments the bright green mallee shrubs trembling in the breeze, looked down, throwing their young leafy shadow in the hot days, and helping to cool the waters, that indeed, even on those hot days were never anything but cool, partly owing to the depth of the embankment and the shelter they gave, but more to tae purity of the spring from which- they unceasingly rose. ' A splendid place for a bath, hot morniDgs, if it is rather shallow,' aaidBob, looking over to one corner where t!ie water had worn rather a deeper channel, ' A lovely retiring room for hoi; even ings,' replied Soph, gazing up at the high embankments, with their leafy fringe of 

 mallee, and their drapery of bud and ten dril, and then down to the trickling water at the pony's feet. 'I'd like to plant some willow slips here. Wouldn't it be just glorious, Bob ?' ' When they grew up ?� yes,' said practical Bob, with provoking coolness. ' Meanwhile it's a jolly place as it is, and Uncle Dan's farm would not be half so good without these waters ;' and heslowly drove the cows up the return path, and out to their pasture ; while his sister knowing she would be wanted at home, took a shorter way through the mallee, stooping here and there from her pony to pull flowering branches and blossoms as she threaded the narrow pathway. ' The land is good, there is no doubt about that,' Ned exclaimed to himself one evening later on, as he stood lean ing over the fence, and smoking his cars fully covered pipe, after a hard day's work among the hay. The season was advanc ing rapidly now, growing warmer every day. It had been most propitious hither to, and the hay harvest wad flue. His own two workmen had been insufficient to gather it all in, and he had been obliged to hire extra help ; but this he readily ob tained, for the sleeping accommodation he gave to his men was neither in the ' pigsty' nor the reaping-machine. Uncle Dan had never treated his men In such fashion � though, even in the present day, some ' cockatoo' farmers are said to pro vide nothing better for their hands. He had erected a small house not far from the barns for their use, which was in every respect as good as his o vn, as comfortably fitted up with bunk*, and shelves, and fireplace, where the men could be happy and snug and warm after their day's work and enjoy the rest they had earned. But then be it remembered that many of these ' cockatoo' farmers care but little for their own comfort or that of their wives and children. Small wonder if the comfort of their hired men never occurs to them. The veriest shanty, barely keep ing out the cold and weather, with rough walls, and rude uneven earthen floor*, is deemed sufficient accommodation for the master for many a year ; not Eimply because he has neither means nor time to expend, for this is rarely the case, bat be cause hethinks it not worth Awhile to bother, where there are so few to see. ' It does well enough,' he says, 'no reason to trouble ;' and so he continues to live, if living it can be called ; and laziness is at the bottom of it all. ' Good land ! Yes, and well worth the cultivating. It was a grand bequest of Uncle Dan's if nothing else came of it,' tkought Ned as he walked quietly round the substantial haystacks and on to the waving corn in the distance, which bore the promise of asplendid harvest. Nedwasfast developing into a splendid farmer, fie was not content with the mere putting in of grain, of cutting it down, of housing, or selling it. He studied the chemistry of the Eoils, he dreamt over reproducing sub etances, he read up all he could obtain to read on the matter, and brought it to the test, as Uncle Dan would never have thought of doing. Having the upper hand � the guiding, the directing mind � in all affairs appertaining to the farm, he could not be satisfied, with the common routine. He had heard that farmers in the 'home land' laughed at the idea of the land being 'worn out,' when all that it needed was the tonic of pure air, and rest, and good resuscitating manures. He knew also that the land needed something more than ' mere scratching on the surface', good land as it was. In his opinion it would pay for scientific farming if it would pay at all ; and as he had been forced into a farmer's life, he determined to bring all the science he could bear upon it, or know the reason why. He was disappointed though, there was no question of that, for the grand object of his research was as yet as far beyond him as . ever. What Uncle Dan had con cealed he had made it so sure that it was quite possible it might never be found. Some lucky accident might, indeed, reveal it ; he hoped it would, but he did not relax the search � not he. ' Underneath,' was his continual watch-word ; and though his days were getting fuller with work as the season went on, and he enjoyed the free out of- door life and the pure air and the delicious breeze that came far over the mallee scrub, freighted with ocean fragrance, as much as did his young brother and sister, yet every now and then the old fever came over him. Places that had been doubly ransacked were turned up again, holes and corners appa rently the most unpropitious were looked into. The treasure was somewhere, there was not a doubt of that; bat where, still remained a question. Chapter V. � Hot Winds and Danger. Hot winds ! They came in early that first year of the Russels' entrance on Uncle Dan's farm, and when the wind was not hot the sun was peculiarly so, ripening the grain so rapidly that much of the wheat was bending its golden ears and ready for the machine the first week in December. This indeed was the con dition of the earlier sown and that in more exposed positions. The rest of the crop would scarcely be fit for the reaper till after Christmas They were busy enough both within doors and without now, far too busy to think of ary thing but their present em ployment. Even Ned had lost his look of pre-occupation, and laid aside for a while the dream of many months. Only for a time, though, and because other things came crowding it out � duties that were imperative � that demanded immediate at tention. It was pleasant still after the heat of the day to sit out of doors together, and enjoy the breath of the ocean breezes that came straying over the expanse of mallee like a tonic, after the enervating labors of the day in sun or hot winds were over. There were days, however, that knew no such relief. When the hot land breeze blew towards the ocean, and evening brought no sea breeze with it ; when the absence of the hot scorching sun rays was the only refreshment the night shadows had to bestow. It was certainly an exceptionally hot summer. Such a summer had not been known within the memory of the ' oldest inhabitant' of that district, at least� and the Russels with their inexperience, their inadaptiveness their newness to the life they had entered upon, were feeling rather severely the difficulties consequent on that new posi tion. ' We shall have a roasting Christmas,' said Bob, as he stood at the western side of the house with Sophie watching the sun slowly sinking to its rest � a great round ball of fire, leaving a train of deep crimson vapor behind him. Higher and higher mounted the crimson tints till the whole western sky was one vivid blush, deepening every moment. Beautiful, very beautiful it looked, but, alas, fore telling another hot day. 'I'll allow we shall have a roaster to morrow, this crimson sunsetpromises that,' said Soph with a shrug of her shoulders ; 'but there may be a thorough change before Christmas, you know, Bob. What worries me most is that everything is so dry and burnt up, and that Arthur and Mr. Ross will not see our farm at its best. It seems only a little while ago and it was eo lovely and green ; now look at the long grass, as dry and withered as hay; and the mallee, too, it crackles under one's feet. But, however, they have had it hot enough in Adelaide, so they will not expect it to be anything better here.' ' Hot ! I should think they just have ! Fancy what it must have been in a close office such a day as this has been. Here one has room to breathe.' 'Boom to breathe !� yes,' said Minnie, who had come out to look at the glorious though ominous sunset, and to sea if there was a breath of a breeze coming in with those golden roseate clouds ; 'yes, for sooth, plenty of room to breathe, but un fortunately the air is so stifling ; and if there was less room in Adelaide, at least, 

 iJob, your occupation tr&s not followed under a blazing sun ; beyond a short walk, you were all the day well sheltered at any rate.' 'Stifling shelter,' said Bob contemp tuously. ' No, no, Min,- give me the out door occupation in spite of the hot winds, scorching sun, rain, or what not. I shouldn't care to go back to the old life now; the new life is far too jolly.' ? You would have been just after Uncle Dan's own heart ; if he only could have known it,' said Min, laughing at his enthusiasm. � But it's a good thing you have taken so kindly to it,' she added ; ' for, so far as i can see, it's the life you are likely to have to lead, and it is well that you try to like it.' ? A hot Christmas ! And they had planned so many things to make the time go pleasantly to Arthur and to Andrew,' thought Laura gravely, as she also watched the sky and noted the ominous setting of the sun, with his long fiery train behind him. How could they enjoy rides through the scrub, or picnic3 in the pleasant places they had discovered a few miles distant from their own farm ? Drives to the beach seemed no longer desirable, for though there was ' the sea, with its deep rolling waves and its tide ever coming in or receding, with whisp or thud, there was no rocky shelter to receive them � no ' cool grot,' but only a great stretch cf sandy beach. In the heat of the sun that beach was terrible ! There were other things, too, that were very disappointing. How could the dain ties of the dairy flourish in such weather? What had already become of their prime, sweet butter ? It waa sweet oil rather. Even the sweetness was questionable; and where would be the rich cream and cus tards if this weather continued ? They were bound in soaae way to glorify their new home, but how to do it if this weather continued seemed proble matical. There was no symptom of the slightest change either as time were on. A good . proportion of the harvest had been gathered in by the end of the second week in December, and still the weather continued hot and fiery, with but little variation ; and Christmas Eve came at length, bringing with it a fierce hot wind in addition to the scorching sun rays. Within doors all was done that was possible to shut out the wind and keep the house cooL It was little indeed that could be done, and the dairy prospect was very poor. Mrs. Russel was too exhausted by the succession of hot days and nights to do anything but lie upon the couch in her darkened room. Even Min and Laura were but little better fitted for the day's duties ; only Soph and Maggie kept up the spirits of the house hold and contrived, as they said, to be jolly over the heat and to make all the preparations that were needful or possible for the expected guests. It was arranged that Bob should drive over to the distant railway- station to meet his brother and Andrew Ross, Ned and his men having full employment for the day, notwithstanding the heat, in making all straight for Christinas, and as their work lay at the extreme end of the section the females of the household were left to the full possession of the house and ita surroundings � to the sighing of the hot wind down the chimneys, and to the dust that every now and then came surging over from the neighborhood of the barns. Those barns, with the stable, the pig sties, and other out-houses in their rear, were situated some distance from the house proper, in a large piece. of ground enclosed by a loose stone wall. The ground itself was 'innocent of 'any verdure whatever; no- tree, noahrobwas visible anywhere in the vicinity, and it was from this slightly-elevated Bpot that the hot wind brought clouds of du3t and rubbish, to the intense disgust of its inmates. I aura had more than once pleaded for a plantation of trees to hide, as she said, the bare unsightly spot from view ; but Ned contended that no doubt Uncle Dan had his reasons for placing the inflam mable portion of his property at a distance from the house, and giving it the farther protection of a wide area of loose soil, on which no blade of grass was ever suffered to grow ; and for his part he considered it better to leave it as it was. Those barns, rough and ill-proportioned as they were, were certainly an eyesore, but he did not regret their isolation or bare surroundings while this hot wind continued, and the whole country round seemed dry enough and ready to burn like fury should a fire occur. ' A strange thing, isn't it, Miss Soph, that your uncle should have 'lowed the scrub to come up 'most to the doorstep when he was so mighty partickler about the barns.' ' Most value there, Maggie,' said Soph knowingly. 'But what I think is Btranger still is that he should have heaped all those tons and tons of wood, and so close to the premises. Just fancy those logs catching fire ; how they would burn S The house would be gone in ho 'time. I hope Ned will have it moved the first leisure moment � some of it, at least � and I do hope there will be no fire, though with such weather as this anything might happen.' ' The scrub's been afire more than wonst,' returned Maggie, gravely shaking her head. ' Mrs. Power said they had a near touch of being burnt up only a year or two agone.' ' Maggie, you are a croaker. I declare you make one feel quite nervous. I shall go outside to see if the coast is clear, for now I think of it that wind does seem to roar strangely.' She thrust on her hat over her brow as she spoke and opened the door, rewarded by a great puff of hot air as she did so. ' It's like a furnace, Maggie. Come out and see. I don't believe it is-all hot wind either ; there irnust:be fife at the back of it,' she hurriedly Jexclalined. -' The two girls sprang to the top of the great logs of wood outside the door, and looked anxiously round them. Towards the low line of hills first � all was safe there. There was a low distant hum of the reaping machine that they fancied they could near, but the ground was very undulating, and the wheat paddocks were in a hollow. They couldnotjcatch a glimpse of the reapers, and at the best of times they were indeed too far distant for any thing but a very fitful murmur to come from them. On every other side, so far as they could see, was the low mallee scrub, swaying and bending to the hot wind. All was safe at present. Nay, was it all safe 1 A red lurid light in the horizon, a tiny wreath of upcurling smoke spreading and glowing as it rose. Maggie caught her companion's arm in a strong grip and gasped for fear. 'Ah, Miss Soph,' she cried, white with terror, ' it's true 1 it's true 1 the scrub's afire ; it'll be down upon us like anything. What'll we do 1 Yons the flames ! aad it's coming right on toward the house.' Soph stayed for only one glance. Yes, there came the terrible line of fire rush ing wildly on them, gaining power and volume every moment. The very crackle of the flames was audible. She sprang from the woodheap and rushed indoors to her mother and sisters. ' The scrub's on fire !' she shouted, with a pale face. ' Mother, there's no time for anything, and there's only one safe place that I know of � the waterhole. We won't trust the barn. Quick, oh, quick, or it will be too late !' And filling her arm with dresses and whatever came to hand she thrust them on Maggie ; herself clutching hold of her mother, who at the first alarm had sprang up, and with one frightened glance out of the window, which convinced her of the danger, hurriedly collected her bank-book and money, and various valuable treasures which she kept always together, and thrust them into a basket that Soph had caught up and held towards her. ' No time for another thing, mother !' ehe eaid. 'Now, Min Laura, follow me. 

 And blanched with, fear they flung open the door, and with trembling limbs and cries of distress and alarm ran hurriedly out. No time to be lost, indeed. On came the flame, leaping and roaring as it licked up the dry mallee and swept over the ground with wonderful rapidity. They could feel the heat of the fire as they ran, but they had got ahead of it ; though the whole air was filled with the smell of burn ing, and the crackling and rushing sound - of its progress was terrible. Would they indeed be able to reach this only place of safety before the flame was on them ? &. momentary glance Soph gave, and with difficulty suppressed a little cry. Tne wood on which they had been bo lately mounted waa in flames, and the thatch o� the house had caught. She dared not ven ture another glance, fcr her niothera strength was giving out. - * I can go no farther, girls !' she gasped. 'You must leave ine.' Leave her, indeed ! ' 'Min, Laura, take those things from Maggie ; she's Btrong and caa help uu with mother. Quick, quick, or we arj loBt !' shouted Soph wildly. Well it was that she knew a shorter way, a way that took them souiewaat out of the line of danger, though still a mere path through the scrub. On, on they hurried, Maggie and Soph half carrying the nearly fainting mother. They were nearing the ark of safety now, every moment lessened the distance, and though the flames were close upon them they reached the goal, ran down the steep road, deeply rutted and trodden by the cattle, and sank exhausted and breath less beside the cool, clear waters. They were safe ! Escaped by the skin of their teeth, Not one of them missing; even the dog and the cat had followed in. the wake. Safe but homeless, for 'ho earthly power could rescue either house or furniture from the destructive element. : *~ ' v' Heaping together some cushions and cloaks that Min in her terror and coif asion and haste had brought away from the house, they laid their mother's almost tenseless form upon them, spreading above her head, to protect her from the sun, a large umbrella, which strangely, though as it turned out fortunately, Laura had '. selected as an article to rescue. Then leav ing Laura and Minnie in attendance, Soph and Maggie ventured up to level ground again and looked out. - What had happened? Surely the wind - had ? changed ! A marvellous change indeed. A cool, strong wind, directly from the sea, fraught with the fragrance of seaweed and of briny ozone, and sweep ing back the flames the way they had come till they beat themselves oat on their already devastated path, having nothing to feed upon. If only this change had arisen a few moments earlier ! It came too late to save the house that was still furiously burning. The sea-breeze, as the hot wind had done, only added fury to the flames. ' No fear now for Ned or the men� no fear for the travellers either ; they are all safe !' cried Soph, her eyes tilling with tears while the laugh was on her lip � tears partly of joy at this assurance of safety, partly of sorrow at the burning of all the household gods that she had been familiar with from a little child. - It was a strange experience, too, this homeless feeling, but she shook herself free from its influence and went down to her mother's side, glad to tell her what a change had been wrought already by the cool sea breeze. 'lbs clouds are gathering fast, mother, there will be rain- before night/ she said ; , ' but the boys will be here soon, aad. they will know wnere to' fake us.' _ ? ? ' No* chance of savingrthe ; house,- Soph' whispered Minnie, eagerly. :.'..'..?.? . 'It's gone already, Min � down to the grouridl-y this. ''Why, it's a mere nothing . to burn,' said Soph, i but I am right- glad the wind's changed, and that the boys .are all Bafe out of it. Poor Bob, and Arthur and Andy ! What a welcome we shall have for them, all our fine cookery and preparation for nothing. Well, never mind, we are safe 1 they will care most for that. I'll tie my pocket handkerchief to that mallee stick ; that will let them know ' where we are, for the ground's too not to venture on yet. . 1 wonder though that Ned and the men have not seen the smoke V and guessed that something was wrong.' ' . ' They couldn't eee nothing where they are, miss, it's down in a holler you know,' said Maggie. ' Are you very troubled about this fire, mother dear ?' said Minnie, her own eyes filling. . 'I am very thankful for our lives, Minnie, though we are so much the poorer. God has wonderfully spared us, all of us. We ought to be thankful for it, for it might have been bo different, If it had happened in the night we could scarcely have been saved from a horrible death,' and she shuddered as the recollection of the wild rushing flame came . over her. ' Poor Uncle Han ! ho w little he thought of such a termination to his plans as this,' said Minnie, and through nobody's fault either.' ' Nevertheless, it's a sad coming home for Arthur. Home! we have no home now,' said Laura sadly. 'A gloomy Christmas we shall all have, and it was to have been so happy,' and she turned away to hide . the tears that would not be withheld, strive is she might to restrain them. . Chapter VL � Blackeotd Rtnurs.' A little later in the afternoon, rattling gaily along the road with its freight of light-hearted young men, two of .them fresh from the city aad ready to appreciate change of scene and air however novel or wild, came the waggonette with which Bob had started that morning to fetch his brother and friend from the railway- ? station. The drive from the station had been terribly hot, and they had made more than one halt on the road � a rest and refresh ment for themselves, as well as .their horses, or most probably they_ would have arrived in the very height of tile conflagra tion. As it was they were still some distance fromiGreyville when the wind changed and the strong sea breeze set in that had so opportunely altered the tide of aflairs, and Bent the raging flames back on their own burnt-np area to smoulder out at their leisure. They had various reasons for their hilarity. To Arthur the prospect of. a country holiday and Christmas festivity, as well as the 'reunion with, his mothsr and sisters was pleasant enough. He did . not care to live permanently in the country, but a few days' freedom was anything but disagreeable to him. Andrew Ross had his own particular reasons for re joicing at the prospect of his visit, and Bob was in high BpiritB, proud of bis pretty waggonette and well-kept horses, which he managed so deftly, and ready to play the part of hoBt whenever he had oppor tunity of doing so. It had been gay enough even while the heat lasted, but when the cool refreshing breeze set in, and glimpses of the sea here and there became visible, there was no bar to their pleasure, and when theydrove into Greyville, and dashed up to the post office, even Arthur was ready to declare it was ' as pretty a little town as one could desire ;' and very bright it looked with its Christmas decorations and leafy alcoves, which in true festive style were erected before the principal stores and buildings. Outside the poBt-office, however, there were a group of men collected, eagerly . ; talking ; an unusual time of day for such a gathering. 'Have you come from home, Mr. - Russel?' exclaimed the postmaster, stepping hurriedly forward as the . waggonette drew up and Bob sprang out. 'No. I left early this morning for the railway- station to meet my. brother and his mend. Is anything the matter V asked Bob anxiously. -?- .-. : * Why, the scrub's been on fire ; some- . where in your direction, they say; It was. just before the wind changed. It may not hare touched your place, mind, but 

 anyhow, some men have started to make sure that all's light,' was the reply. With a pallid face Bob turned and sprang again to his seat, seizing the reins, and urging the horses forward. * The scrub's on fire, and Ned's away out of call and oat of sight at the end of the section,3 lie managed to explain to his ex cited hearers. And on they drove again � furiously this time, with -an indistinct but terrible dread upon tliem � more real to Bob, who had already witnessed more than one of these sudden conflagrations on a small scale, and knew something of the rapidity with which such bush fires travel and the destruction they carry with them. ' 'What, indeed, if it had touched their home? Where was mother? Where -were the girls? he thought, though he clared not utter the thought. Meanwhile, quite unconscious of any danger, sheltered in the hollow, Ned and his men had been working as hard as the teat would let them, making all prepara tion for Christmas rest and enjoyment on the morrow. They had just completed the work, and the horses were turned with their feces homewards � for there was yefc much to be done in its vicinity before the festivities of Christmas could be entered upon � -when two horsemen from Greyville dashed up the road and shouted to Ned from the fence. ' Mr. Bussel, there's been a fire in the scrub your way ; I fear it's done some damage !' * A fire !' exclaimed Ned, running f or- tt ird. ' Our way ? and we seeing nothing of it!. Impossible!' * It is a fact, though, I am sorry to say, It's the lowness of the scrub and the land here lying in such a hollow, of course you couldn't see it.3 With one spring Ned was over the fence and off towards home. 'Here, take myhorse !' cried the other hastily, throwing himself out of the saddle. 'Keep up, man, it may not be so bad after alL Grey will ride with you, and we'll follow to help if needed. ' 'Motherandthegirls!� what had become of them ?' that was the moan he made be tween his blanched lips as he dashed wildly forward and came in sigtit of the spot where his house had lately stood, now razed to the ground, a black and emoMsg ruin. That was all he had to welcome him, excepting the names that still leapt and writhed amidst the tons of wood which were now sending up volumes of smoke. Throwing himself from his horse he ran forward, searching wildly sinongth.eash.es of his home� for what he dared not think. ' They are not here, that's certain, ' cried Julius Grey, in glad tones, showing what ins o-fraTurattered dread had been. * Take heart, man ! the ladies have escaped. I warrant me we shall find them in the barns, for the fire has not touched them.9 And Ned, nerved by the new hope, tore off to the barn, followed by his com panion. Untouched everything, if o smell of fire upon them. Horses, pigs, fowls, the men's premises all unscathed. But in vain the search, in vain the shouts, neither his mother nor his sisters were there. 'They were either afraid of taking shel'er here or were cut off from ventur ing by the fire,3 said Grey, ' but don't be disheartened, don't give up, Bussel, I'll wager they are safe somewhere.' Id his heart though he had so such hope, whatever his words of cheer were. Where, indeed, could they fly before that fire ? Their very flight would make the difficulty greater. No, there was only the sickening certainty that they would pre sently come upon the charred bodies, stricken down one by one in their wild terror. His own heart quaked at the dread of the sight that awaited them. There came a clatter of wheels in two directions� Hie waggon and men from the section, ths waggonette from Greyville, followed by a goodly number of horse* men. - : There mg*, sqgcten halt w$d a shout ; 

 then the waving of a smaU white flag from the top of the waggonette, followed by a succession of shrill whistles. �The waterhole! I had forgotten that.J^Thank God!' ciied Ned, leaping again to his saddle and springing forward. ' H they made for that they are saved.' 'Eafethey are, too, thank God !' echoed Julius Grey fervently, as side by side they rode alorg, reaching the waggonette just in time to see Mrs. Russel carried in tfce arms of her two sons and tenderly placed in the vehicle. * Allright, Ned, no one hurt V exclaimed Bob heartily, as Ned reeled towards them; Mother's only exhausted and frightened. Thank God that you are safe too !' ' We was never in danger, Master Bob,' said one of the men, 'but we might have been, ' he thoughtfully added , ' but for that lucky shifting of the wind.' * We have no home to welcome you to now, Andy,' said Arthur ruefully ; 'poor Uncle Dan's old house has come to grief, and swept off all our possessions with it.' * Never mind the house since the rest are ail safe,' replied Andrew heartily, pressing Laura's hand as he assisted her to her mother's side, ' the house is nothing to that.3 *Not much,' said Bob. ' I'm sorry for our 'Lares and Penates,' as Laura calls them, but the old house is not worth grieving over. We must choose a better site next time we build.' * A nd meanwhile my mother will be only too glad to receive youall, 'said young Grey eagerly. ' We've lots of room, and it will make a grand Christinas for us. After all, Bussel, as your brother says, the old house was not worth much ; the Iosb of the furniture, and in particular the piano, is the worst, but the wheat and the hay and the stock are all safe, so other matters can soon be made right. *YeB,3said Soph, with flaming cheeks, 'and mother has saved* her greatest treasures, as well as her bank-book and all the money we had in the house. ' ? ' And Soph saved our lives,' said Min lovingly. ' If it had not been for her bravery and thoughtfulness we should none of us be living now. * Hurrah for Soph !' said Bob, ? I always knew she was a brick.3 'It was the dear old waterhole that saved us,' said Soph, with an effort to appear indifferent, and with a little toss of her head. But she lowered her hat brim, for there were tears in her eyes which she did not cere to betray as she quietly sprang to her place in the waggonette. For Ned had accepted the hearty in vitation of Julius Grey most thankfully for his mother and sisters and brothers and their friend. But he himself elec ted to remain on the premises for the night with tile men, ' To keep an eye on the stock,' as he said, ' and see that no further danger came from the fire.' He had resolved to remove all the unburnt wood from the heap, and as some of the Greyvflleites had volunteered their assistance this was a matter likely to be speedily accomplished ; so with pro mises to join them on the morrow he stood and watched his Mends drive off. It was after the last 'of the cavalcade had disappeared and the men from Grey ville had completed their self-imposed tack and had followed suit, while his own men, seeing that all danger from a renewal of the fire was over, had gone after the cows that were lowing to be milked, and to attend to the stock in general, that Ned walked slowly away to the old Bite of Mb home and stood moodily looking at the ruins, 'Was this indeed the end of all his fine expectations?' he thought, as he noted the total wreck in which every thing lay around him. All had gone roof and walls� One charred mass of black logs strewed the ground, even some of them still smouldering, and vestiges of things that would not burn were min gled with them. 

 'Poor Laura's piano! how proud she was of its fine tones,' he exclaimed with a sad smile as a tangle of wires and half burnt keys bore evidence to the spot in which it had lately fallen a victim to the fire. Here and there were other trophies � but all so utterly destroyed that they were worthless. How now about Uncle Dan's bequest ? Where now was the hidden treasure ! He went dismally about among the ruins, lifting a burnt log here and there and turning over smouldering heaps of rubbish which might cover something of greater importance ; though * If anything had been hidden in the roof, under the eaves, or the rafters,' said Ned to himself, ' surely some sign would have appeared before this, for Uncle Dan would never hare committed the folly of hiding away a treasure without securing it against the danger of fire as well as robbery.' The walls even were levelled to the ground � could it be possible that anything had been concealed ' Underneath' those walls ? But the light was fast waning, and the pale moon was throwing shadows as well as its own mild radiance over the scene, everything was becoming indistinct, and Ued turned reluctantly away, resolved that he would ienew his search with the daylight, for almost hopeless work as it was, he had not quite given up all hope. He took his seat at the men's table to share the supper they had prepared for the entertainment of the young master, far more carefully than they would have done for themselves � a sapper which, thaiiks to his own and his mother's libe rality, was by no means stinted in either quantity or quality. It was, however, but a poor pretence he made of eating, as the men remarked to one another. ' But then it was not mucli wonder that he was a bit downhearted ; who would not be V they said ; ' the burning of the house was bad enough, but all that fine furniture and the books and planner ; such a loia was not calculated to make a man feel happy.' .3 he night was cool, almost chilly in fact, for the clouds were gathering, with a promise of rain, and the breeze still came in fresh from the sea. But refus ing the men's kind offer of one of thair bunke, Ned took down a couple of carriage-rugs that had been left in the barn, and, preferring its seclusion to the company of the others and the fresh sweet smell of the hay to the odour of fried meats with which, their apartment was pervaded, he mounted to the loft and threw himself on a heap of hay scattered over its floor, and rolling himself round in his rugs, resolved to wake with the first light of morning, he soon fell into profound slumber. Chaptee 'VTL AMD Last. � *Ui�DEEXEA.Ta.' A soft roseate light came stealing in through the half-unglazed window of the loft and fell upnn Ned's upturnsd face, wskisg him suddenly from his slumbers. ' Where was he ? By what strange chance had he stolen from his own bed to sleep upon the floor of the hay-loft ?' The events of the past came slowly crowding to his memory, but, as if only half zoused, he lay quietly wrapped in his rug, looking as quietly round him. There through the open window, or half-door, opposite to him, came the soft light of dawn, deepening every moment, growing rosier with every advance, bring ing in with it fresh invigorating breezes that heralded a lovely day. Christmas morning ! And in such a sky as this the angels must have pro claimed their * glad tidings of great joy,3 the advent of that Saviour who brought to our earth the only peace that can never disappoint, the only joy that is unfading. Christmas morning, glorious with its golden clouds and . rose-tinted vapors. How the memory of all that Christmas had seemed to him in the past, as year after year had brought it as a gift to his hand, came like a dream before him. This Christmas morning, as he rested on his strange couch, the sweet smell of the 

 hay filling the air, the soft light of the early dawn falling over him, what had the day brought to him, when this was all the home he possessed upon the earth till another should arise phosaix-like from the ashes of the old ? How far was this possible ? Easy enough if Uncle Dan's hoardings could only be discovered, if indeed the fire had not already swept them away. Not so easy if everything must be done on credit, placing the burden of years upon their shoulders. He believed still that under neath that house, or underneath some object in that houre, the mystery had been concealed, but the heat and the flame had passed over it, and doubtless it had passed with them. Springing half up on his novel couch he looked eagerly around him. 'If the treasure, whatever it was, had only been placed there. But there was nothing that would warrant such a conclusion, nothing about the place but heaps of hay and old wheat-sacks thrown .together in confusion in one corner of the floor. But the rosy vapors were rising higher and higher ; and rising also and shaking himself lustily from the clinging hay, he descended the ladder and passed out into the fresh air, turning his steps swiftly - towards the black ruins of his old home. Again he turned over the logs, up turning various remnants of furniture, the semblance of which the power of the flames had nearly destroyed. With a sort of sad irony he recognised his own room by a few half-burnt relics that had been cherished for many a day � some by him self, some by his brother Bob. Here, too, was his mother's room � an arm of her large chair, the skeleton of her iron bed stead, gaunt and partially bent, and melted by the heat, everything upon it reduced to ashes. In the place where the sitting-room had been were traces of books. The book shelves had been there, and a goodly number of books, in which they had greatly delighted. A difficult matter it would be to replace them. A whole life-time's collecting had been scattered in a few moments to the four winds of heaven. Not regret all this 1 Was it possible not to regret it? There were things they had lost beyond the power of money to restore, and perhaps a spark from the pipe of an inadvertent smoker had done all the mis chief. But Ned was himself a smoker, and therefore did not pursue the thought. Sere was the little passage, or rather had been the passage, leading to Soph's famous china cupboard � a little hoard initself she hadthoughtit onitsfiratdiscovery. Wrecks of the delicate china came to fight here. Broken china and melted glass betrayed where the dark little closet had been, be tween two rooms, now laid bare and open to the light. Ee turned over the debris, scarcely expecting any revelations now, he had so thoroughly gone through that closet, shelf by shelf, more than one?, to the displeasure of his sister Laura ; yet slil', with a small iron rod, he turned slowly and carefully over all the broken china, the half burned blackened masses, with their sickly smell, that had fallen as roofs and walls fell, and peered anxiously underneath each mass. ' Stay � what was this 11. His heart gave a great leap, and then stood almost still. Nothing less startling than a small iron cashbox, the lid half crushed in by the weight of a fallen rafter, and but for the uplifting of that rafter and the mass of what appeared to be burnt wool or flannel that was clinging to it, and in which it had possibly been folded, he might aever have discovered it. A small iron cashbox! He seized it with an exultant acclamation. Was this the key to the mystery or not? Was more yet to be found ? This first � the rest might declare itself afterwards, and seating himself in the shelter of some of the logs that had been removed the night before from those still burning, he began with hands that trem bled in their eagerness to wrench with his iron rod tlie already breaking hinges. 

 But little force was needed � up came the lid, and on the very top of the con tents lay a note addressed to himself with his uncle's signature attached, and the date of the day when written, evidently just before his last visit to town. It was like a voice from the dead. Ned tore it open eagerly and read the few lines it con ained � ' In case of my death at any time prov ing sudden � which I have been fore warned may be � though I have no faith in doctors, and don't believe it will � and the possibility that It might not be in my power at the last to reveal where I have planted the bulk of my property, I hereby notify that the keys contained, in this cashbox belong to a large fireproof chest that I have had for many years concealed in the barn in a cavity specially prepared for it. look in the hayloft. In the right hand corner a number of wheat sacks are lying, Remove these and you will find a small knot in the floor near the wall. Touch this and the two shorter planks will rise, the spring will disclose why. ' Underneath.' that spring is the fireproof chest. I add the last this morning, before my departure for Ade laide. This box, according to my will, with all that it contains will fall to my sister, your mother, during her lifetime, See to it that she Is not wronged. ' Maybe there will be no necessity for this, I may live many years, and I may see reason for readjusting my affairs, for disposing of my money at interest for the benefit of you all. Since I have known your mother and her children maybe I have distrusted my kind a little less and am growing to believe that I am not doing quite right in this matter of secret hoarding. Well, I will try it a little longer and see the result. * Your uncle, ' Daniel Bekville. ' ' Poor uncle !' said Ned to himself as he closed the letter. * If he had only lived a little longer none of these complications would have been needed. His distrust of mankind would gradually have van ished ; he would- properly have banked or otherwise invested his money � we should have been gainers and not losers by it. At any rate, there is no doubt that he wanted mother on the premises that he might have confided-in ner. Well, it is too late for all that, and but for the fire I have been deploring � which indeed might have cost my mother and sisters their lives � we might never have made the discovery of what in his last moments he tried so hard to tell us. Row,' he continued rising, 'I must act, and not moralise,' and folding his letter back in the box, which contained little else but a few unimportant papers and a bunch of keys, he went immediately back to the barn, and mounted the loft, first making sure that the men were some dis tance off, and about their work, and were not likely to intrude. Carefully removing the sacks in the corner indicated, he at length made a small clear space, searching for the knot that was specially to solve all the difficul ties of the situation. There it was � an apparently insignificant knot in the plank � but that that must be the one was cer tain, and, hah? holding his breath, he pressed it down with his forefinger. It yielded, up rose the short planks � a kind of trap door in the flooring � and there beneath it stood the fireproof chest. He did not attempt to open it alone ; but with beating heart and compressed lips closed down the spring, carefully re turned the sacks to their former position, threw the rugs he had used for a covering carelessly upon them, and with the cash box tied up in his handkerchief, went out to the stable, saddled a horse, and set out immediately for Greyville. What was said on the occasion of Ned's advent among the Christmas morning breakfast party in the Greys' hospitable mansion, or how his revelations � 'as good as a fairy tale,' as Mary Grey declared � were received � what cheers were raised, 

 what excitement produced, what healths were drunk in coffee, or how the whole cavalcade, Mrs. Russel and Mrs. Grey excepted, set out after breakfast to inspect and remove the lucky find, would take too long to telL r^SffiSSB It was an excited group that gathered in that old hayloft a little later on, while Ned, recklessly tossing aside the wheat sacks, touched the secret spring, thereby revealing the wonderful chest, which. Arthur and Bob helped him to unearth amidst loud acclaim. Then Ned, perfec ly white with excitement, fitted in the key ; the lid flew open, and the revelation was complete. Heaps upon heaps of notes! golden coin glittering beneath them ; deeds of land which no one had dreamed he had purchased ! But there was little need of speculation as to the amount. Uncle Dan had kept accurate accounts of his hoardings and property, and this lay at the top of the whole � a grand sum total of thirty thousand pounds ! What more remains to be told ? Only this � that the revelations of that Christmas day, so curiously brought about and yet by such simple means, naturally brought with them other changes. A beautiful home went up not far from the famous waterhole ; and to this home in two or three years Ned brought a fair young wife. Bob remained with his brother, a partner in the firm ; while Arthur became a successful Adelaide merchant. Mrs. Bussel and Sophie had a lovely cottage just out of Greyville, for there were other happy weddings. Andrew had found courage to moot the important question amidst the rejoicings of that happy Christmas, and Laura had not answered 'No;' while Julius Grey taking his cue from the general joy of the occasion, con trived to convince Minnie that he could not possibly be happy without her, and she ? Well, we have said that more weddings than one were the result of the fire, and after all a great deal of happiness lay ' Underneath' the daily life that fol lowed ; and Fncle Dan's last wishes were, maybe, gratified at last.
