 CHANCES AND CHANGES 

 (By T. E. LOIV). ' . 

 CHAPTER Xin.� SPRINGTIME. 

 'Isn't this better than life in town, May?' The girls have paused, and Evelyn Buckley gives a sigh of satisfaction as she turns round to loolrat the view. Rising from shadowy violet valleys, with their densely-wooded slopes, are tier upon tier of soft blue-misted hills. The setting sun adds a peculiar beauty of effect to the distant trees, and, as the shadow lengthens, golden shafts of light glance through the 

 nearer ioliage, touching the waving, tender tips with green gold fire. The undergrowth is made lovely with a profusion of flowering ehrubs; some with strongly-scented blos soms amidst spiky leaves, others masses of graceful yellow bloom. Evelyn is laden with a huge bunch of lilac 'heather,' which abounds in low, tufted bushes on every side, its delicate fragrance rising in waves of perfume to her face. 'Yes, it is all lovely enough, I grant,' assents May Ferrars, 'Tint it is all a shade too rural and peaceful for my taste. I love activity and the. bustle of life, and would sooner hear the whirr of cable cars than the most tuneful thrush you could produce. It is just as well we are not all constituted alike Evelyn. For my part, I'm sure I should get the blues most awfully if I lived here.' 'Perhaps, then, it is as well you are not staying longer, if you feel like that about it, though I shall miss you dreadfully.' Evelyn smiles tolerantly at the trim little figure in the pretty frock, at the dark sparkling eyes which would soon tire of flashing their gay coquetry at trees alone, for, as a bne m Rubenstein's song, runs� \\No men are in the forests.' 'Ah, here are some late tigers!' exclaims fcvelyn delightedly, as they come upon a scattered group of curious yellow-and-brown orchids. I thought they were all quite over and that I bad missed them.' She kneels down to caress them, but does not gather them. 'Why don't you pick tnemr asks Miss Ferrars. 'I couldn't be so ungrateful* when they have waited for me like this. I always re vere late flowers, somehow,' she says, a little absently, looking across to the purple shadows beyond. 'They are so plucky to venture into an unsympathetic world, where it must be very lonely for them after all their kindred-are dead' and gone ' . 'What queer notions you have, exclaims her cousin, moving on. 'Quite creepy. But look down there, what a number of wattle trees. I eee there is a fence � aren't they in Uncle John's land?' Evelyn soon joins her and they find on the other Mope of the rise a rustling green mass stretching away below them. 'No, that is Leawood property,' she replies. May ponders a moment in silence, then asks abruptly, 'You don't like him, do you?' with a slight jerk of her head in the direction of the wattles. Before Evelyn can reply, she continues, 'I know I put my foot m it the other day when I was admiring tlie house as we drove past it. The bit you can eee from the road has quite a romantic Englisby air about it, but Uncle John didn't like . my saying so at all, I could easily see.' 'No, we are not ow friendly terms. Father kas always hated theMordaunts.' Evelyn speaks rather shortly, as if the subject is distasteful; . ..-.?? 'Why?'.' aBks May, openly inquisitive and . nothing daunted by Evelyn's tone. 'I don't know the whole story myself, but I fancy there was some youthful quar rel at the' bottom of it. Father has never told me and we never. speak of it,' a little repressively. 'Is he rich?' asks May, still unabashed. 'No, quite the contrary, I imagine.' 'Well, anyway, it's a pity we can't know him,' May remarks regretfully, 'because he has an awfully nice face, and I'm sure he is a gentleman.'. Evelyn, after a swift glance at the other,, averts her eyes and bends her head over her flowers. 'How do you know that? I inean, where did you- see him?' she asks slowly, without looking up. 'He was at the railway-station yesterday ?when I returned from town, and I asked Cyril who lie was. , 1 guessed- there was something wrong by the funny way Cyril told me, she adds, with a gleeful little laugh, and then the subject is dropped. 'Wba't have they been doing bere?' she asks, the next moment, her attention di'4wn by the crisp crackle of newly-dead gum leaves underfoot to a number of dry boughs lying about. 'They hive been cutting new posts from Iwo large trees here, I expect/' replies Evelyn, looking ' round her. ? '-They ' must have been huge trees to leave so much lying about.' ' . ? ? 'Nice for. making a fire, remarks May (carelessly^' stooping to pick an orchid. 'Do you suppose Cyril really means to go to the war, Evelyn ?' she asks presently, .with: her customary suddenness. _? 'Certainly, if be can go as an officer; bw of course, it is doubtful whether he wi be picked when there are so many experi enced men to-choose from.' 'But he.. is a good shot and rides well, ,wbich should tell in his favorr 'Perhaps it will/bufc he has no military training'' replies Evelyn, ?wondering if by chance Cyril should go in the same contin gent with Derek Jfordaunt. - 

 Halli - 'Cyrll:iad gone off with his father that jnormnjt, bo -that the two girls have beeS left to*hemBelves. '- Mr. .Buckley had been'glad to feel that Evelyn would not -be left alone, although. hehad'eome to the con clusion during. the winter in- town that he nad been ? quite unnecessarily alarmed. He had watched her closely and was quite re ?assured by. the zest with which Bhe.had en tered into all the amusements and social gaieties that had offered. Hehad-no idea that it was the 'unrest of her mind which welcomed, distraction with a feverish eager ness qurte unlike her usual. indifference. ?Neither does he know how, in the .loneli ness' of .her own room, the. struggle is. con stantly raging. in her soul between her pride and that strange, unsought love which she strives to kill, with bitter self scorn, and which only thrives yet stronger under her treatment, though she knows it not. The- part week has at .last taught her that her heart's wayward inclinations are beyond her control, and her pride is dragged an unwilling captive to that bitter-sweet know ledge. Ftns this which has robbed her voice of its old careless ring of gaiety, which has given a greater depth to the expression of l'er eyes; yet. at tne same time, this know ledge brings with it a certain peace also. It is no lonser a thoughtless girl who gazes that night across the valley to the distant trees, but a woman who loolcs bravely into the future with a strange hopelessness, yet with proud resolve to bear her burden un flinchingly. But since man believes often what he wishes to believe, her father fondly ima gines that she is only feeling a little dull after the life in town. He sometimes re grets having 'built this fine house so far rom the bus^ haunts of men, for itjs rather beyond the fashionable summer'7 resorts. Sometimes iis he surveys the handsome or nate mansion, with its many gables and line tower, the thrill and glow of pride in its possession change to regretful sensations hat there are, comparatively^ so few to see it in its splendor. Then, again, he is never really happy here, away from- his1 city life of 'business and the club gossip. The quiet solemnity of the hills lias a depressing effect on his spirits. ? It had been principally to. gratify his old rancourous .spite against Philip Mordauut that he had chosen this site tor a home, and. there liad been a morbid satisfaction in 

 out-doing the solid grey house opposite in every up-to-date particular. _ There had been a savage joy in encroaching more .and more on the Leawood property as he gained one paddock after another, culminating in the delight of outwitting his old foe in the matter of the entrance gates. Yet the de light is short-lived, because John Buckley is honest enough with himself to own that it is not a transaction to be proud of, and al though this makes him no less relentless in the matter, he has not derived the satisfac tion from the affair that he expected. He realises this with fresh force as he wanders over his property on a certain Sun day afternoon, shortly after they have re turned to the hills. Evelyn and her cousin have ritlden off with Cyril as escort, to pay their respects to Mrs. Graham,, and he is left alone with his thoughts, which are not pleasant ones. . His wanderings presently bring him into Long Gully, in sight of the wattle planta tion, while he, surveys with grudging ad miration. ' As he realises what it represents to its owner, a fresh wave of spite surges up into the crooked channels of his mind. A conviction steals over him that the trium phant coup he has promised himself is growing more and more visionary, for it is a stronger foe he has now to contend against. He recalls 'with singular vividness a cer tain grey afternoon, years ago, how he had ridden up to his new gates leading to the grand mansion which was just completed. A slender grave-eyed lad had been playing in the road with a huge dog, and when he had beckoned to the, boy to open the gates for him he had calmly folded his arms with boyish defiance and had refused to budge an inch. He remembers how in angry amusement he had flicked his whip at the impudent youngster, who had etared up at him with flashing eyes in the white set face. 'Who are you, my fine young sir?' he remembers he had asked the lad, with half uneasy curiosity. The answer came prompt ly, with that steady defiant stare. 'I'm Derek Mordaunt. You hate my father, and I hate you.' He had laughed harshly as he turned to the gate, hut the words rang in his ears for days afterwards. That boy is now a man. He has never swerved from his original attitude towards him and he has persevered in his resistance with a success galling to his father's enemy. Cyril's vaguely suggestive remark recurs to his mind with a certain hateful persistency as he stares at the wattles at his feet. 'Can't you see your way to prevent those wattles being a success?' he had said. How? he asks himself again. With a curi ous creeping step he advances' slowly to wards the'boundary fence, and his quick furtive glance shows him the fine growth and large extent of the young trees. They form a thick, dense mass, with the blos soms shrivelled and brown, which not long before had been a sheet of golden yellow. As he leans on a wooden post, in bitter contemplation, he does not hear approach ing steps on the soft springy turf. Suddenly a lithe, tall form confronts him on the other side of the fence, and the cowardly blood rushes to his heart, leav ing him a queer yellowish grey. He catches his breath grith a little gasp and swallows hard, as he glares at Mordaunt- through blinking eyelids,. The latter regards him with cool non Ichalance, a quiet smile dawning in his grey eyes. , 'I suppose you re admiring my wattles, Mr, Buckley?' he asks, with a touch of the -old boyish impertinence in his suave amiability. 'I think they ought to bark rather well. We start on them next month, I expect.' ? .'Mr. Buckley has. recovered from the first alarm, of iwhich he is bitterly conscious, and a fear of having betrayed that alarm now makes him doubly enraged at the 

 other e coolness. 'H'mt I suppose you've need . to feel thankful,' he retorts with meaning, as he takes a step back from the fence. 'I have, indeed, as 1 hope this will see me through my last liability,' returns Mor daunt, with the same pleasant blandness of manner. He proceeds to light his pipe, but, observing the other's expression be tween the' initial puffs of smoke, he cannot' help' smiling to himself. ''Every little is a help to a pauper, I sup pose/' sneers Buckley, in futile rage as he turns away abruptly, scarcely noticing where Is going in the whirl of emotion, which shakes lijm to the soul. His pace is akin. to a scuttle and little resembleB Ids usual' pompous strut, but his speed is suddenly checked . by a short stump, over which he stumbles violently. 'With -a stifled curse he glances over his shoulder to see if Mordaunt is watching him, but no one is in sight; '''' He is suddenly struck with the amount of dry litter all round him, 'and he observes 

 thM tiiere* are dead botaghif ' and ? twigs strewn about lor some distance below. A queer foxy expression steals into his eyes, and he smiles furtively as he calculates the -distance, to the boundary i^nce. '-V . . *,'A few bright .days' and a north-easterly wind,' he thinks. . He walks back again over the ground he has just traversed,- and pauses where the girls had- noticed the debris round the Stumps of. the trees1 only the afternoon before. : ?' - '. -~ 'Ah, I toid Simons to cut down some timber in this corner, but I didn't realise it was. quite -so near, H'm!' He^ooks round cautiously. 'Yes. there's-' for 'too much stuff lving about;' this place wants clearing to give the grass a chance next year. * We must get it done w.hiie it is lawful to light fires;' and- there is a vin dictive gleam in his eyes, which bodes little good to Derek Mordaunt. The weather favors . his designs by its brilliant sunshine during the following week; there is a hard, unblinking glare, which is an early touch of summer, often experienced in the Australian spring. What a hot day . I shall have for my journey to-morrow,' remarks May, de jectedly, as they sit down to dinner on Thursday evening. 'It may change by the ' afternoon,' Evelyn answers hopefully. 'I noticed some curious clouds in tne sky this afternoon, which look like wind. Probably it will be wet and cold; the weather is so variable at this time of year.' ; . ,-?.??- Mr. Buckley regards his daughter with a curious, fixed expression as she speaks, of which lie is quite unconscious, till he is roused from Ins train of thought by . some mischievous sally from May. When dinner is over the two girte sit out on the broad balcony to enjoy the air, which grows cooler as night comes on. 'It will seem strange without you, May,' Evelyn says, a little wistfully. She knows that she will miss her cousin's jolly laugh and merry fun more than she cares to realise. . -* . ?' May. regards her rather intently as she leans against the rail of the balcony and faces- the other. The dusk has deepened, so that she can scarcely, distinguish her .cousin's features. 'I say, Evelyn, what is the matter?' she asks, with startling abruptness, but with real concern. 'The matter? What do you mean. May?' 

 returns Evelyn, in open astonishment. 'I n-Pin (hat you're in love, my dear, or I am much mistaken.' She is not certain in the fading light whether Evelyn is blush ing, but thinks so. 'Anyway, you might do worEe than take him,', she adds gravely. Evelyn glances at her with amusement and relief in her eyes. 'I am still in the dark as to your meaning � what him?' 'Are there so many, then?' retorts May; laughing. . - ?Evelyn ignores this sally with calm con tempt and May continues sagely, 'I hear he is a very clever surgeon .and that his father is rich, and I am sure he is not at all bad-looking. Perhaps a little short for my taste, but then he always looks so. beau tifully clean.' Evelyn can scarcely reprere her mirth. 'May,' she cries, 'do not be such a sphinx. Who is this short, clean surgeon?' Then a sudden thought flashes into her mind. 'Oh, May!' she exclaims, with a quick change of tone, 'You surely are not refer ring to little Dr. Seaton?' 'Yes, I am; and why not?' replies May coolly. 'Oh, no; I never dreamt of such a thing. He is an exceedingly pleasant little man, and I like him immensely. But I am sure he is not ? ' She stops short suddenly, in conscience-stricken confusion as small in cidents rise to her memory in quite a new light. 'Oh, but he Is. and very much' so. Where have your eyes been?' And you are alwaye so particularly pleasant to him that, as I said just now, you might do worse.' 'Hush, May; I can t bear to think that you may be right,' she says in a distressed tone. 'I do hope not; I never thought of him like that.1' 'Then it is someone else,' Misa FerraTS remarks shrewdly, and Evelyn winces be fore the amused glance which accompanies her words. 'Forgive me, May, if I hurt your feel ings, but I can't discuss these sort of things. I know lots of girls do, but I find it impos sible to do so.' You see, I have neither mother nor sister, and so ? ' She does not finish her speech, and May rises and puts her arm round her. 'All right, dear. \\ understand, and I won't ask. awkward questions; but I hope it is all right,' and, she kisses the other's pale face with unwonted warmth. Evelyn recognises the well-meaning sym pathy in her tone and she' smiles a little sadly. 'Thank you, dear,' she answers softly, and she withdraws from the other's clasp as she speaks. Contrary to expectation the weather con tinues to be oppressively hot, and Miss Ferrars very nearly decides to remain a day longer, 'But, thenj I hate the wet weather, even more, and it is bound to change soon,' she . remarks, - as they drive to meet the Melbourne express. ., There is certainly an unwonted calm in the atmosphere � that deadly calm before a storm� and when Evelyn turns the horse's head homewards unpleasant little puffs of dust rise from the road as the wind gets up. 'If it means a good rain later, I do not mind,' she thinks, glancing up at a few ragged clouds in the pale blue sky. the next turn of the road shows the form of- a woman trudging steadily along, .carry ing a child in her arms. Evelyn pulls up as she notes the tired droop of the back and finds that it belongs to Airs'. Blake. 'That boy is too heavy for you, Mrs. Blake,' she says kindly. 'Let me give you a lift, as it is an awful Say for walking, I am sure.' Mrs. Blake's face brightens as she says, hesitatingly, 'You are sure you don't mind, miss? I can walk all right, miss, only its Charlie; he's had a long day in town and is just tired out.' .' 'And so is Charlie's mother. Come, get un both of you,' insists Evelyn, as another 

 gust of wind puffs the dust into her face. Very little encouragement is needed to loosen Mrs. Blake's tongue and she pours forth her day's doings, and dilates on her purchases with unction, giving the details of her ' bargaining adventures with such verve that fchrelyu smiles several times dur ing the recital. . 'You see, ? Jim's in regular employmeni now at Mr. Mordaunt's. His leg s still stiff, but he can work quite well, and, on the whole, I'm not so sorry as I was about it.' 'Why?' asks Evelyn, a little surprised. 'Well,- if all the men 'are going to the war; as they say they are, if Jim's leg hat been all right lie would have been the firot to be picked, as there ain't a man living as could hold a candle to my Jim in the. saddle, and it's good riders they want. But now, he can't ride more than a little bit, so he's safe to stay, thank the Lord!' ejaculates Mrs. Blake fervently. 'Is Mr. Mordaunt - going,' asks Evelyn, as she nicks her 'whip father smartly, on the bay's shining flank, 

 ?'I towik bq; T:but he Wll go ah Hie Bushf men'8 contingent, if -he does; as they have got to set things fixed up here first. before he can leave. .: iTo-day .they are cleaning out aiid enlarging Yong.^yaterhole''. before the rain comes � not any. too soon, 'by the. look of the sky. That's ^hy Jim couldn't meet ine to-day, and I was nearly not going at all, but as I'd fixed up to go and didn'tjlifce to disappoint Charlie,. I went after all. Be-, sides, Mrs. Hone's little girl couldn't have minded baby, another day, pVaps,' and eo on and bo, on. '_???' , - Evelyn cannot refrain from a sigh of re-., lief as she .drops the ^garrulous youns: woman at the stip?pahels of the lane lead ing to her cottage. She hopes thatu Jim does not bore his master to the same extent as Jim's wife does herself. ., . ? . ,\\ 

 CHAPTER XIV.� THE STORM. After a solitary dmnei Evelyn goes out side: - The wind is distinctly north and, seems to dry everything in its course. She fancies there is a touch of snioke in the air; after a moment or two she feels sure of it. 'It is just the night for a bush fire,' she thinks rather anxiously. 'I wish father was at home.' ? ^ She goes round to the stable yard and calls one of the grooms. 'I think there must be a fire somewhere,' she says quickly, 'are the men seeing to it?' 'Yes, miss! It is in Long Gully and It is all right: you needn't be anxious.' ? ''Why? Is it not an accident? Won't it do some damage?' 'No, miss. It was Mr. Buckley's orders ?that we was to clear that corner patch out � the fire 'was lit half an hour ago.' 'Still, won't it spread very much in this wind?' she asks, feeling ill at ease. 'Yes, but that is what we want. We was told to wait for the wind, as then it will be sure to bum out that thick scrub patch and clear the paddock for grass.' There is a certain good-natured tolerance in the man's passive countenance, for which Hvelyn could willingly have shaken him. She realises it is useless to expect any sympathy for her fears from the men, so she turns impatiently away. As she does so she remembers the stretch. of wattles on the hillisde below that ^particular paddock, and 'with sharp thrill of anxiety she. calls the man back once more. 'Are you q�ite sure there are nlentv of 

 men to prevent it getting a.\\vay from them? It may get into the next property.' 'They will do as they was told, miss, you may be sure,' the man answers a little sulkily, 'and il's tiiat Mordaunt chap's look out if It does get into his place.' There is a touch of impertinence in the fellow's voice, which he evidently imagined will please Miss Buckley -as much as it does her father; for there' is not a man on the place that does not know of the^ master's enmity towards his neighbor. Miss Buckley turns towards the house with a fearful^ cbnvktion that things are even more serious than she has imagined ; How is she to warn Derek Mordciunt of the danger which threatens him? She cannot send a servant without raising curious and vulgar conjectures, and yet Mrs. Blake had said that she knew the two men would be 'dead beat' after their hard day's work at the waterhole. Wh'at if he were a6leep� if he was not roused in time? There is but one way � fo 20 herself! She shrinks in stinctively fjMm the act, but her courage rises and scourges her conventional timi dity. She remembers his hatred of debt � that incubus which burdens his life, and she resolves that she, at least, will not add to that burden through a false sense of pro priety. Trembling at herself, when the resolve is once made she wraps a black shawl round her head and runs swiftly through the gar den towards the distent light which twinkles intermittently through the wooded slope which lies below the house. In reality she is little more than ten minutes in reaching the terrace out-side Derek's study, biit it has seemed io her ten hours; as she arrives, wind-tossed and breathless. She stands for an instant in doubt how to act and has just resolved to ring at the big door in the orthodox way when she looks in through the Mindless window and stays her steps. It is als she thought. There he is, with book on the floor, which has evi dently slipped from his grasp when sleep overtook him, and his head droops a little on his chest. Tears spring; to the girl's eyes, as she gazes on- the sleeping fonn of the man she loves, and as she notes the discomfort of his attitude she longs to ar range a pillow for his head, and to let him sleep on.' She nearly forgets her errand in watching him, while a divine tenderness transforms her face. A cus1!;. of wind buffets her mercilessby and recaUe her to the present danger, and she taps sharply on the window pane. The sound is lost in the roaring wind, and in des pair of being heard, she turns the handle of the French door, which is at once dashed violently open by tile wind. Surely he will wake now, she thinks, watching him intently, but so deep is his slumber� that of sheer fatigue, that he only turns his head a little uneasily and that is all. 'I must wake him!' Evelyn glances anxiously at the lamp, which flickers un evenly in the wind, and' she moves it out of the draught on to the mantelpiece, and then she returns to Derek's side and reso lutely shakes bis arm. 'Eh, what, Jim? Not time yet surely?' he mutters, stirring slightly, but not open-' ing his eyes. r'l Have come to tell you that I believe your wattles are in danger,' Evelyn says, very clearly, bending over him a little as she speaks. Mordaitot opens wide his sleep-laden eyes at the voice and stares as her in dazed be wildernient. For a moment he finds it im possible to realise her presence1, then as the pale face flushes beneath the intensity ol hie gaze he awakes to the fact that it is no vision but Evelyn Buvkley herself who stands before him. He 6its upright and th'en rises to lus feet and carefully concealing thte amazement which fills him, he says quietly� 'I beg your pardon for being caught napping like this. Miss Buckley. I have had a hard day anc felt unusually fagged out. The weather, 1 think. What a terrific wind!' and he closes the door to shut out the gale. 'Did- you not understand me just now?' asks Miss Buckley, noting ,hia leisurely movements in a frenzy of impatience. '1 told you I'had come to warn you that your wat tles might be in danger. Our paddock above, is on fire.' 'What! Long Gully?' She nods quickly in answer 'to his startled question. He turns and looks out into the black night anxiously. 'Damn him,' he mutters savagely, 'I might have .guessed,'' then he turns swiftly. suddenly remembering Evelyn, whom he had forgotten for the mo ment in the shock of her news. His pulses throb as he meets her anxious eyes, and he

Evelyn recognises his courteous desire t� relieve her' of any embarrassment caused by, his presepce and a little smile- plays.. round hpr lins aR she seats herself in his-big 

 chair. She need not have feared� of course he is a true gentleman through . and through, as she bad known in her heart that he was long ago. With a strange exultation she looks round the room, noting its simple charats- �_ ter, yet the excellent taste displayed. Be yond the shabbiness of the carpet and the lack of curtains there is nothing to indir cate the poor man, for the furniture is mas sive and handsome, and the bookshelres � full of well-bound volumes, while on the large writing-table lies one of the latest books of travel. ? She lifts her eyes to the mantelpiece, a little doubtfully, she feels rather ashamed of gratifying her curiosity in his absence, but unlike Cyril's sanctum, it is utterlyj lacking in photographs of stage beauties ia questionable costumesu the're are none -of any description. On the table beside the inkstand are two frames, one containing a picture of Philip Mordaunt, the ' other encloses a speaking likeness of Jerrold Seaton: She holds it in her hand to look at it more closely, when! Derek returns, carrying a glass of wine and some biscuits on a small tray. 'I am afraid it is not as it should he,' he says, laughing a little shyly, -'{here ought to be a cloth affair, shouldn't there?* A d'oyley, you meant answers Evelyn', smiline, and no longer anxious or unhappy* 'Really I don't need this at all,' she pro tests, shaking her head a little, but taking it nevertheless. Derek moves away quickly to the win dow, under pretence of seeing if the raint lias ceased, but in reality to hide his foolish! delight at seeing her in his own chair with' ier head uncovered, for she has thrown' back the shawl, which trails over one -irni down to the floor. _ ? . *~ 'It is getting lighter; it will stop soon,'* le says a little jerkily, as he turns tow&rdtf her, and then his glance lights on Jerrold'a photograph., which is close beside her. Shti has evidently been studvjng it. The'fira dies out of his eyes and the boyishness - vanishes from his manner. 'That is a good likeness of Jerry� deaP old chap,' he says a little heavily; with! a brave attempt at a smile. Evelyn ia quick to detect Hie change *in his voice and she feels herself blushing furiously. Does he, too, think? She looks up at him, but he averts his face; he has seen that conscious flush and is anxious not to deepen! her confusion, and once more, with a mur mured apology he goes out and lear�s-het alone. ' The next moment Evelyn rises impatient' ly, feeling a wicked desire to throw Jer- , Told's photograph on the floor. She longs for the rain to stop. ' % 'If he thinks that, so much the better; he is less likely to guess the truth/' she says to herself, as she picks up her shawl. There is a whimsical smile on her face aa she glances almost affectionately round the room as she takes a mental farewell of it, when her eyes are arrested by a group of schoolboys, clad in flannels, on the opposite! * wall. She crosses the room swiftly and quickly picks out Derek, the. captain *of the team. As she meets the full glance of thei clear boyish eyes jshe recalls that incident ' of the tea-rooms -at the oval when they; - were both mere children. SEe is still studying it intently when Derek returns. He watches her for a m.91 ' nient before she is aware of his presence.
