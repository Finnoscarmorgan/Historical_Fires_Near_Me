 ' (1, purblind race of miserable men ! How many amonjj us at this very honr Do forge a Jife-long1 trouble for ourselves.' '* Gov'ment House' at the bead station of ]\\lanooro looked cool and shady in the. hof dawn of an Australian sunnier morning �--t a ]�undred years ago. .Beneath the bro-id veran dah two men stood talking, each remarkable 

 in his way, though presenting a strong c -n- Irast to each other. The one of small, almost diminutive, stature, which his di hdbille more completely revealed, yet. of the most faultless proportions and symmetry, lithe, sinewy, and thoroughbred all over. His features were clearly cut and refined, \\et with a look of quiet determination, which stamped him as a man of great strength of purpose and power � a innn with a history, too, as you would see if a better lijiht showed the haunted look about his dark eyes and the grizzled grey of his hair. Yes, Lance Brock had a history, Ibe pages of which were stained and irarred by the misdeeds of a wild life. Our story deals, however, not with him, but with his companion, ?who stands, booted and spurred, leaning lazily against the rough pillar of the verandah. Jack Hoscoe, late Captain of Per Majesty's � th Regiment of Guards, the best gentleman rider in the hunting c mnty of Loamshire, late ihe darlinc; of various fashionable ball-rooms, the boon companion of manv titled gentlemen, I�ut now the ' Gentleman Jack' of my story, and s'ock -keeper on the station Manooro, in the District of 'Wimmera, Victoria. Let me introduce him to you, good reader. He will not trouble you km*. His life, which might have been so happy, fio fruilful of all jrood things, was short, restless, and barren. The track which he mijrbt have left sbininsr with ihe harvest of good deed i he beheld desolate and ruined, burnt by the fires of passion. ' A short life and a merry one,'' my brave gentlemen, guardsmen, piungers, and what not. The. motto is a somewhat sorry one. The brevity is unquestionable; but the merri ment is of a bitt�r sort � the mere, 'crackling of thorns' saith the wise man of old. .Tick Hoscoe, as I have said, presented a complete contrast to Urock in person. He was six feet four in height, and broadly built in proportion, with an enormous brown beard reac iing far down his chest, and a frank, daring expression of countenance, not free, however, from a suspicion of sensualism, and giving the idea of great physical courage, but of little moral force. Just now his broad brow is c'oudy and depressed, and the wearied look upon his naturall? eager face shows that the hour is dark with GentJeman Jack. Thev had met before, the�e two men, under many strange and varied circumstances. A Bhort three years before the date of our story i he v might 'have been seen bending over the hadille of Lady F-. the famous beauty of that. ^ t-ar, in KottVn Row ; or playing for �100 I--�k�s during the' long-fcveroi ui-rht at M-�d:un� K'*. Two years further buck tney j ,drt frith bv side throu ;b the fierce Indian war. an! in many a hot skirmish on the plains of J'.icj tub ; find on a certain fiad, grey Pioriiiu*, �H-\\er forgotten and bitterly to be ic-nembsred, especially by one of them, they v-ere together, ' when Lance Bock stood 25 I'rtcus from the. brother of the woman he ruir.e.'l aud shot him through, the. \\ eart. Ah, Low he Oivied the quiet, still look of the tleau man that morning lying with a brave smile upon Lis face Leueath the star* J 

 Thenceforward Lance Brock carried with him � banished from home and happiness � a memory which he had better, far better, have never been born than hare borne. Of the past life of Ro?coe we shall hear again. Let us listen to the conversation which is now taking place. The speaker is the smaller of the two men. 'Well, as you like, Jack; there's no reasoning with you when you take the doldrums. I know the country twice as well as you, and am better up to the work ? but I'd think twice before I ventured alone. The catile will be deuced troublesome, and if they're not the niggers will be. It's only last month that poor iJick DiMioran was found a week dead with a dozen spears in his carcase. Bather an ignominious death for the hero of the ? th ! Take my advice � let a couple of the boys go with you.' �' If I go at all 1 shall go alone,' was the reply. As for the cattle, the old horse and I are good for twice the number ; and as for the niggers, the dozen we strung up to avenge poor Dick will keep them civil for some time to come. Three days alone will work off this fit. The presence of a dog is irksome to me just now.' ?* All right, old fellow, hare it your own way ; you'd not be fit for mucb if you had mv memories to curse you, if a pair of blue 

 eyes can work such havoc with your serenity. Don't cut your throat. Keep well to east'ard of the brown range. You'll make Dick's but to-night, and find plenty of tea and flour to keep you going. I shall send the doctor and a bov to give you a hand if you're not b?ck on the fourth day. An revoir ! here comes Tim with your horse.' j With a grutit of farewell, Jack Koscoe 1 strode Sown the verandah, his spurs clanking on the hard lime floor, and flinging himself into the saddle was soon hidden by the dens*? bush which surrounded the clearing ui�on whieh the station buildings were. ] His errand was one of pome difficulty. The day before, the blacks had brought infor mation to Brock, the overseer, that some thirty or forty head of cattle had been driven by a bush fire into a deep gully between two of the low ranges, the tops of which were visible above the s=ea of mallee, 90 miles from 

 the home station. The black* described thus spot as one easily entered by the beasts in their terror and excitement, but most difficult to get out of. Koseoe's mission was to ex amine this place, and, if possible, to drive or burn ihe cattle out of it ; or, if that proved impossible, to come baak for help to shoot and skin them. The sun roar* hot and blistering: abore the dense, close forest through which Roseie rode. The birds open-winged panted upon the trees so utterly exhausted that they might have been caught by the hand Beneath every bush crouched in the welcome shade wallaby and kangaroo, careless of the stranger who crashed throu 'h their seldom trodden terri- \\ tory. The only living things apparently un affected by the intense heat were our hero and the sturdy old horse that bore him. The first seemed too much engrossed in deep thought 

 to heod anything; besides he hatl borne, through jungle and forest, the terrible heat of India, and had kept a cool skin fighting be neath the eun amid the flashing of eanncn'and the grimy smoke of battle. The horse was of a breed almost extinct now � the old Sydnev stock-horse. ' Worth his weight in gold,' Jack used to say, and he was no bad judge of a horse, having ridden some of the crack steeplechasers of the day in his time. Not much for speed those old horses, but posses sing wonderful endurance, power, and muscle. Old D tndy, as he threaded his way skilfully through the mallee, would have scorned to turn a hair under a ten-mile gallop, and looked as cool as a cucumber, while the very native animals were panting and sweating. 'We leave Jack and his horse steadily and siJer.tly making for the night's camping- place � Dick Donorau's hut � forty miles from their starting-place. (To he continued )
