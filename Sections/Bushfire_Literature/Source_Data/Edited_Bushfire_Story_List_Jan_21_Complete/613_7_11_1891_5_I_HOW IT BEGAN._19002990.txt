 THE BLEXLEY FEUD. 

 [In Two Chapters.] 

 CHAPTER I. 

 HOW it began. 

 There was no reason why it should have been called the Blexley feud, rather than the Pierson feud j though, to be sure, the place of its origin was in old Mrs. Blexley's house ; or to be more exact, in old Mrs. Blexley's butter tub. 

 She was not old Mrs. Blexley then, but merely a matron in her forties with a house full of children who were all the way from babes to young men. 

 It bade fair to be an unusually busy summer, for Mrs. Blexley had eight cows upon their hands j and she had felt herself very fortunate in having gained the Piersons' consent that their youngest girl, Dorothy, should help her through the 

 summer with the butter. 

 She proved tobe a help. " Whai; Dorothy don't know 'bout butter-makin' aint worth knowin'," was no empty boast by Mrs. Pierson. The girl had beon brought up, as her Aunt Lyddy repeatedly expressed it, " In the good old-fashioned way of not only knowing well how to work, but how to 

 work well." 

 Mrs. Blexley gave over to Dorothy the work of butter-making, and all the packing. 

 Even then matters might have gone on smoothly if the Blexley's chief dependence in the shape of a dun cow had not choked herself to death with a turnip.. That event delayed the packing of the June butter in the new tub just brought home for the purpose. 

 Mrs. Blexley always declared that when people bought tubs of 'Lijab Starks they " knew what they was doin' � 'Lijah's tubs didn't need soakin' a month after he'd cured the Btaves; they didn't soak nothin', out or in. They'd weigh, too, just so much, whether or no." 

 It is possible that her opinion was influenced to some extent by the fact that 'Lijab. was her brother. It was a fact, however, that butter kept well in Mr. Starks' firkins and tubs 5 and if Mrs. Blexley chose to put down hers without a long preparatory soaking of the receptacle in brine, it was �o one's business but her own, and perhaps that of the buyer of the butter. 

 At anyrate this tub, prepared for the dun cow's butter, was simply laid aside in the buttery off the kitchen until it was needed, six weeks later, after the two brindle cows' calves had been sent to tho butcher. Then a simple brine and sa'tpetre rinse was enough, in Mrs. Blexley's judgment. 

 " And now, Dorothy," she said, as she brought the first five pounds from the scales,-for Mrs, Blexley invariably weighed every pound herself, and chalked it down on ths " butter shingle' 

 which always hung behind the scales,-" now, Dorothy, see how quick you can get that tub full. I promised it to Mrs. Miller to send to her son, a fortni't ago." 

 " I can fill it in another forni't if you don't mind skimpin' at table a little," Dorothy answered, proudly, as she put down the first compact layer. 

 " I can skimp if I must, but yon'll all know just what I'm doing it for. I b'lieve in bein' honest, even in skimpin'." 

 That was something she prided herself upon. It was a Blexley boast. The Blexleyo were stiff backed people on this score, and woe to all persons who fell short in weight or measure of any kind. 

 Mrs. Blexley always considered it buta Christian duty unflinchingly to make known the deficiencies of such people, and to announce that she " had no further use for them." 

 The performance of this duty was only the exhibition of another trait in the possession of which the Blexleys had equal pride. This trait was candour-one which people who make inordinate boast of honesty feel bound to cultivate. 

 " I'd rather a body'd fire into\\ my face than into any back, any time," would be MrB. Blexley's only apology for the plain statements she so often made-statements with barbed points and edges. 

 There were thoso who felt that Silas Pierson expressed their own views when he answered her at the oat-threshing : 

 "Jes*so, Miss Blexley 5 but a body aint called upon to be always firin' at nary face nor back, simply 'cause a body's got a gun !" 

 �But other people's views did not affect her own. She Btill spoke with exceeeding eandour on all 

 occasions. 

 The last churning had gone into the tub in less -than the fortnight. The white cloth had even received its tbin layer of salt, and the cover was ready to be put in place, when Dorothy proudly turned it over to Jim Blexley at the foot of the cellar stairs, with a beaming face in answer to his admiring look. 

 It was sweet, fresh, and firm-either the face or the butter ; and if Mrs Blexley was pleased with the butter, Jim could not be blamed for admiring the 

 face. 

 *' The man that gets you'll get somebody," she .emphatically asserted, as the choice tub was deposited on the scales ; and Jim nodded as he stole another glance at Dorothy's blushing face. 

 But, strange to^say, the tub only tipped the beam at fifty-eight and a half pounds ! 

 " Five, eight, ten, six-" 

 Mrs. Blexley hurriedly went over the figures on ?the shingle. 

 "Why, Dorothy, there aint butter 'nough here into two pounds and a quarter !" 

 "Perhaps you've made a mistake in countin'. 

 let me see." 

 Both counted. The whole Blexley household in turn counted the column on the shingle 5 but try as they might, they saw that Daboll's arithmetic never could countenanco fifty-eight and a half as the answer to this problem : " If you put forty eight and tbree-fourtho pounds of butter into a tub weighing twelve pounds what is the weight of the 

 whole-?" 

 " What has become of that two pounds and a quarter of butter ?" ? 

 Mrs. Blexley asked the question again, as she 

 went about the house. 

 She knew there must be as much as she had estimated. Her figures didn't lie. She wbb almost inclined to prove it by " taking it all up," but Mrs. Miller was oven cow clamouring for it, and it was sent on immediately. ' 

 Polly, her daughter, had witnessed each weigh- ing before it went to the tub. That tho tub could have run under 'Lijah's rule-twelve pounds-was not to be thought of. He had said it didn't, and that was enough. 

 He certainly had not made a tub under the usual weight in the last batch he made before he died, she conclusively argued; and Jim had to confess that he had weighed it when be brought it home, and it met the requirements. 

 It was a puzzler. If it had only stopped at that ! But it did not. Next day Mrs. Blexley puta point Wank question to the astonished Dorothy, 

 prptby, what did you do with that butter ?" 

 " I ? I packed every ounce you sent downstairs '.*' 

 she indignantly exclaimed. 

 " But you couldn't 've," protested Mr8, Blexley. For answer Dorothy walked straight over to the nail which held her sunbonnet, put on her head wear and went home. Later in the day her brothers' waggon came to fetch her things. 

 " To think Mrs. Blexley the same's called me a thief !" she said, in telling of it to her friends. 

 Shortly the Blexleys heard a report that Dorothy had said that Mrs Blexley called her a thief. 

 " I didn't !" declared Mrs. Blexley. " But where did the butter go ? I'd rather lost a tub than b'lieve Dorothy took it j hut it don't seem real honest to flare up so at a candid question." 

 " Such candid folks 're apt to get slander mixed ( up with candour," said Dorothy's brother. " A Pierson's aa honest as a Blexley, any day." 

 "Folk's don't put on hack braces unless they need 'em," retorted Mrs. Blexley, when this remark came to her ears ; and this brought a retort from one of the Piersons, to the effect that " folks could he so straight-backed and that they leaned the wrong way." 

 These were mild shafts which grew rapidly into most venomous ones, the immediate result of which was that Dorothy passed Jim on the road without looking at him. The good-hearted fellow had it on his tongue to tell her that his mother meant no harm -, but it occurred to him that such a statement would require an explanation which he was unable 

 to give. 

 Then, when a friend told him that Dorothy had said that she " wouldn't have one of the Blexley tribe if they were the only ones on earth" he gave up, left home, and was brought back in six months 

 dead-killed in a steam-boat disaster. 

 A fierce feud had well begun, which presently extended not only to every relative on either side, but took in all the people in the village. Almost every inhabitant was connected in some way with one family or the other, and even those who had no connection with either were drawn into the quarrel. 

 In fact, as Uncle Billy, the stage-driver, said, no one could live in peace in Weston without fighting on one side or the other ; and in time each had .married so strictly among its adherents that, aa Uncle Billy also remarked, " 'Twan't safe to wag yer head 'foro every one, for you was sure to hook a Blexley or a Pierson." 

 This was not all. The Pierson faction set up a rival cooper shop, so injuring Jason Starks's trade that he was unable to meet his notes, and lost al- most all he had. Ab Blexley did not report a brush fire that had caught in Piersons' lot, and 'two families were made nearly penniless by the damage 

 that ensued. 

 Banfield Pierson bought up Joel Blexley's notes and sold him out for a small mortgage hp held, and the shock to the old people was so great that Mrs. Joel had a stroke of paralysis, while Joel went 

 insane. 

 Everything that had blood was capable of doinij, except the actually criminal, was resorted to by both sides. Politics, patriotism, and religion were forgotten or swallowed up in the quarrel which 

 raged. 

 The Town meeting served only to reveal which 

 faction was present in tho greater strength at a i given occasion. Sometimes the town went for the 

 Blexley's and sometimes for the Piersons. Smaller | Behool district and line-fence feude were engrafted 

 upon the greater ones. 

 Religion ceased to be fostered. No minister could please both sides. Subscriptions could not be raised for salaries for more than one side, and two societies could not.be supported. A feeble prayer meeting took the place of the regular Sunday 

 services. 

 Some of the people sold out their farms and moved away. A rude outside element begin to push in. Soon the staid old tavern was converted into a billard saloon and a drinking-house, which was freely patronized by a rising generation undis- turbed by wholesome restraints. 

 The village seemed to be deserted by God and man ; but the old residents only withdrew more within themselves, and, with groans over the lost prosperity, let evil-doing run riot. 

 Twenty-five years later, as old Mrs. Pierson said on her deathbed, " You wouldn't 've Known that 'twas the same place." ,
