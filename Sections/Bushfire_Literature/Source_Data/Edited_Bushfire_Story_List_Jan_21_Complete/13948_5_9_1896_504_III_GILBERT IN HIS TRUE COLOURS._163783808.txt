 [All Eights Reserved.] Ciumed IIL� GILBERT IN HIS TRUE COLOURS. 

 The boats were loaded, and lay tied to tbe mangroves, which grew in gnarled luxuriance in the tidal water. J ust back from the bank of the river were ti-trees and swamp mahogany, and further inland the white box studded the heavier soil. A stray yal-yal was in yellow bloom, and in the damper ground the congewoi spread its broad, green leaves, feebly attempting to imitate the rich, cream v flower of its cultivated kind. 

 Neither Burton nor Gilbert were at the bank, but presently the latter strolled down. Sutherland, addressing him, said in a significant way, ' I thought you might not be coming.' Gilbert made a reply which would not be pleasant for a woman to hear. ' There are three people before whom you had better keep those ideas quiet,' Baid Sutherland, and, bracing himself up, he continued, ' One is Folly, another is Burton, and, seeing Dan close by, he hesitated. ' Who is the third P ' said Gilbert. ' The man who saved your life,' replied Suther land. Gilbert flushed under his fair skin. Dan's face became set as he stepped forward, but Burton came up with his cheery ' all a-board,' and ihe scene passed over. We were soon out of the mangrove screen. The men bent upon the oars which worked clum ' sily on the thole pins. The boats floated deep, with but a few inches of free board, making the work heavy, especially for those who had spent the past fortnight in debauch. The tide was with us as we slowly plugged up stream. The river in its lower reaches is practically an estuary, ebbing and flowing with the tide. On the margin, mangroves straggle in the oozy mud, behind is a belt of alluvial vegetation, and then the reedy swamps cloae in, where stand great ti-trees, shrouded in brown, broken bark, like belated species, but these melt away into tro pical vegetation at the toe of the rising red lands. But in the higher reaches the dense scrub crept down to the water's edge. Masses' of great native ivy hung from their heads, far out over the deep waters, under this only a fleck or spangle of light told of the sun shining brightly overhead. Spring, capricious even in these semi-tropical climes, having delayed her coming, hud raced along since the recent rain. Although the red leaves of the cedar had not yet dulled down into green, the creepeis were bursting into bloom, and at Blackwall the ourrajong was preparing its buds. . Regent birds were making playgrounds in ihe ; nndergrowth. Riflemen, fresh purpled, darted under the thick canopy. Flocks of parrots flew overhead, the reflection from their plumage blur ring the silver of the pools ; and as the boats came suddenly round the sharp bends, coveys of ducks flapped hurriedly away. We camped the second night where the hills, still slothed with primeval forest, held the eastern 'bank to the 'water line. - On die western side kangaroo grass waved over broad plains in un broken green, and far in the distance Wollumbin 

 stood like an isolated fragment, its head above the fugged, intervening chain, and its base pillowed on the Tweed watershed. On the third day we entered the western branch, the main river still keeping its northerly trend, and reached the falls near Bungabee. Leaving our boats, we humped our swags up the creek, and camped in a valley on the northern side. The creek ran here within deep banks, fringed by narrow brushes. Contracted on one side, the plain broadened out into a wide prairie on the other, reaching from the edges of the scrub to the abrupt forest hills, while the brush crept, finger-like, up thj valleys. Cedar was not as plentiful as on the Terania flats, but grew closc to the banks of the creek. The darkies were, numerous but not hostile, and since we were working close together there was no danger, even if they had proved troublesome. A couple of weeks passed by, during which the timber bad been felled and fiitched. We finished our work early one afternoon, and determined that next day we would return to the heads. While lounging in Ihe camp after dinner Gilbert said, ' The darkies have done fairly by us. I'll give them a treat, so that when we come again they will not regard us as enemies. I'll bake a damper that will leave a good taste in theii mouths.' Having baked the damper he placed it on a stump far out on the flat. As he returned the darkies stole from their gunyahs and gleefully bore off the treasure. The twilight was slipping into night when a wail from the darkies' camp reached us. We listened for a while as it grew in intensity, cease less and pathetic. Burton sprang to his feet, exclaiming ' We must go down. Bring your guns with you.' When we reached the camp there was little need for guns. In the presence of the King of Terrors tho fear of tho whites had evaporated. There, in the semi-darkness, lit up by the flicker of the fires, lay a score of fine, sleek fellows in the throes of death. The darkies gazed pathetically at us in their fear-bom confidence, as the dingo and kangaroo huddle together when ringed by a bush fire. One old fellow explained by gesture what had happened. The eating of the damper, the sudden j sickness, the violent spasms iu all their awful details. But the pantomime was unnecessary ; we knew they were poisoned. ' Arsenic right enough,' gasped Burton, and surging round on Gilbert he said, ' You gave the poor devils poisoned damper.' - ' I did not know there was any arsenic in camp,' said Gilbert, 'I put some soda in that was stuck under the rafter.'* ' I put the poison there,' replied Burton. 'I brought it in case the dingoes were troublesome. You dog, do you expect us to believe you don't know soda from arsenic P I'll shoot you where you stand.' Gilbert, with all his faults, was no coward. ' The mac who left the poison about must accept the responsibility of thiB business.' ' ' Burton's face became livid, but Dan stepped I forward and gently took his gun from him. He made no resistance. ' Mates, we can do no good,' said Dan, ' We cannot aid them, they will meet their grief best in their own way. Let us go.' We lay round the camp fire late into the night, Gilbert still protesting it was a mistake. He was clever enough to Bee the easiest way out of the trouble, and the more simple and credulous of us believed his story. The men, tossing uneasily in their bunks, made a bad night of it. When the day broke, after hastily eating our morning meal, we went down the creek to the boats. AH nature seemed hushed, save that again and again through the mists of the morning floated the wail of the darkies as they mourned their dead. Chapteb IV.� POLLY SPEAKS OUT. The. men during the homeward trip were strangely different from the cheery mates of a ft?w weeks before. On their up stream journey, after the effects of the spree had worn off, their spirits had revived. Every break in the banks, any change of vegetation or flight of birds had furnished them with themes for conversation and rough jests. But now the brilliant flame-tree might have worn funereal hues, and the bright plumaged pigeon been draped in crape. For us there was no brightness. Nature seemed shorn of her glory. But among vigorous men moody apprehension is not persistent ; so by the time we reached the Heads the sponge of time was ob literating the harshness of memory's outlines. | Gilbert jumped jauntily ashore at the landing ! where the boats were unloaded. As Burton left j us he called after him that he would be up in an I hour or two. Burton came down to our humpy after tea. Seating himself on my bunk, he said, ' I am not wanted up above just now. People can manage their own affairs. I have told Polly, but she just listened, and gave me no satisfaction.' ' Yes,' said I, ' Polly mu&t fix up this busi ness herself. Gilbert is such a plausible rascal he may talk her over. He's made Sutherland and Lee believe it was a mistake.' Dan sat gloomily looking out into the night. Burton left after an hour's silent smoke, but in a few moments returned and said : '' I suppose you chaps will put me up if things are not right up there,' jerking his thumb in the direction of his hut. ' Anything here is yours,' said Dan, ' but you won't be back. Strange that you should rear a girl and not know her.' . So youth often solves a problem when age fails. Youth is unreasonable but trustful, generous but thoughtless. Age is often considerate but hope less. Burton's face softened as he looked at Dan, but lie made no remark, and we heard the twigs crack under his feet as he walked slowly away as if not sure of his quest. The wick floating in the tallow 'steadied the light which flickered in Burton's kitchen. Polly stood with one arm against the wall, gazing into 

 the fire. Her face was pale and set, but a light shone in her eyes, continually changing with the varying emotions in which her rapidly formed love for Gilbert struggled ?with her recently awakened distrust. To doubt her father seemed to her impossible, but to believe him carried with it the destruction of her dream aud the abandon ment of her lover. Was she to lose the man to whom she owed so much for one she knew so little P So her practical common sense reasoned, but was almost overborne by the overmastering [ passion that knows no logic, fear6 no to-morrow, and see6 the future gold glinted through the atmosphere of love. ? Yet her wholesome fear of self-deception came again and again to her aid, aud bit by bit the truth of her father's story was forced upon her. She remembered how, three days before, when the dreadful tragedy waB being enacted, she had seen her lover's face outlined in the embere of the fire, and ennobled by her fancy it had seemed the embodiment of kindness and of truth. To-night the embers gradually contracted, and his face again slowly took shape. But how different � cruel, thin lips, eyes closed, 1 ill only a slit of yellow Bhowed between the lids. Gilbert's true character lay depicted before her. It was the face by which I knew him. but she had never seen it till that night. The door swung open, aud Gilbert entered. The girl turned round with tbe last mood upon her. ' Back again, Polly,' said he, coming forward as if to kiss her. 'Sit down, Gilbert,' said 6he, pointing to a chair on the far side of tbe fire. 'Presently,' he replied, ' when my sweet ? heart has welcomed me.' 'No, not yet � at least,' she wavered. Tlien her strong will re-asserted itself, her voice be came cold and hard. Gilbert's face was fashioned as the likeness in the fire. When honour looks craft fair in the face,' her clear glance pierces the flimsy shield like a spear. Gilbert's glance fell. Polly knew her father was right, and her path was clear. 1 1 ' Gilbert,' said she, ' stand back. I have something to say first.' The man smiled doubtfully as the girl con tinued. ' Father has told me about Bungabee, and I now want to hear your version.' The man hesitated and advanced. ' Not a step nearer,' said the girl, ' till I have heard the story from your own lips. I pledged myself to you, and will stand by you in the face of all ; but you owe it to me to let me do it with a clear sonscience. The man proceeded in his plausible way to make the same explanation that had satisfied Lee and Sutherland. The girl's clear eyes were fixed on him ; his drooped towards the end of the story. ' Is that all P ' she said. ' How much more do you want ? ' replied Gil bert. ' Surely you will believe me.' ' I would if I could ; but it's not true, Gil bert.' ' Most of the men believe me,' he replied. ' Do you think you can impose on a woman who loves you as you can on Sutherland, who knows little more than how to hold his bullock whip, or Lee, who thinks the greatest thing in the world is a straight cut with the saw ? My love for you makes this hard, but I will never marry a coward.' ' You are harder on me than those who don't care for me. You think more of blacks whom you never saw than of ray happiness.' ' There would be no happiness with me unless I respected you, and I could not do that now I know. No,' Bhe continued, as he began to Bpeak. ' It iB bad enough ; don't make it worse by lying to me. You can go.' Gilbert went to the door, but looked back at her aB she stood facing him. ' If I go I'll never return,' he said. ' You will not, indeed. I don't want to preach to you about mistakes and love. The. man I love I must respect, and I cannot honour a cur.' The strange yellow gleam came into Gilbert's eyes which always told he was aroused. ' How would Dan suit you ? ' he said. ' How dare you speak lightly of the man but for whom you would have smashed like a log ou the rocks, who left me without an angry word when I chose you, who is as gentle as a child, and strong enough to snap, like a rotten lawyer cane, those who presume on his good nature.' Gilbert stepped away from the door. Tlie darkness seemed to revive him, for we heard him go whistling to his humpy soon after Burton left us. It was soon known that Polly Burton had done with Gilbert. Dan heard it early next day, but he never went near Burton's, nor made any attempt to see Poll}'. We had discussed a journey to the Tweed to sample the cedar there. Almost every evening we talked the matter over, but no definite time wa6 fixed for our departure. Polly might make some feign. I knew Dan was hoping so. No other reason could have caused him to defer the trip when his mind was made up. But the summer wore on into autumn. The biting westerlies searched from the tableland right down into the sheltered coves near the beach, and had died away. The heavy rains were setting in. Already the river had come down, carrying timber from far up the creeks. Tho foliage, although it does not here show the autumnal tints of colder climes, was deadening for the coming change. The broad green leaves of the conjewoi were being tarnished and spotted with brown, like damaged gloves, but no message came to Dan. He was coming up from the landing one after noon, and passed Polly on the way. She made no sign of recognition. He looked wistfully after her as she disappeared tvhere the brush closed the pathj and turning to me, he said, ' We will start to-morrow. ' ' How small are the tiny, dull-blue violets ; still they werald have wrought a miracle for a etroDg man. How scentless they are, but a little withered bunch, could have distilled an arom 

 which would have filled the universe ^with -odours of Eden for one man and one woman. Why could not the woman who carried them in her bosom, and tenderly kissed them each night as she placed them under her pillow, have left them on the rough table of our humpy for a manly soul to see P The great things of life are ever controlled by the small ; so these tiny woodland wee3s joined together, and yet kept apart the best man and the truest woman in the settlement. {To be continued.)
