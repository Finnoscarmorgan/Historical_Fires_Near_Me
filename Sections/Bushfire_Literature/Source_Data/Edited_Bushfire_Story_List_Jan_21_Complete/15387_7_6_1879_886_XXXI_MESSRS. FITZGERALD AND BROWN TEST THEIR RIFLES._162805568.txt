 Luke Mivers' Harvest. 

 By N. WALTER SWAN. 

 The 'Sydney Mail' Prize Tale. Chapter XXXI.� Messrs. Fitzgerald and Bbown TEST TliEIIi. RlFLER. 

 ' The passenger,' said the steward of the Taralooloo, '?stayed in Brisbane for some time after landing. I did not go on the return trip, and had an opportunity of seeing him here in Brisbane. I believe he spent a good deal of his time at the hospital above. He found some one who had returned from the diggings lying in the street in fever, and he carried him up and looked after him � so I heard.' 

 ' Thank you, Bryan,' Fitzgerald replied. ' Your in formation will assist me materially. I will call at the institution to-day.' He found the little patient propped up with pillows, and the fire of the fever gone, but there were dark circles round the eyes, and the lassitude that followed the struggle for life had come. The surgeon's hopes of him were faint, and he told Fitzgerald that if he had come later the patient would not have strength for his questionings. .Bartley tremulously answered after his fashion. ' I don't know what the name of the gent was, sir, what carried me here, but I see him before at Narrgummie. He won the Bteeple there � some squatter, I think.' ' I am trying to find him, and persuade him to come home again. His father wants to see him and be recon ciled, before he dies. You would be doing him a great service if you could tell me anything concerning him.' Bill Bartley put his two wasted arms on the coverlet and looked up mournfully at the speaker. ' He left here to go to the Palmer, sir, an to join a lady that's hansomer nor a queen � ah, ever bo much hansomer. I see her there, an 1 knew her in Victoria, but I never see nothing like her before. Her looks were always enough for me ; but I were'nt the only one. I knew chaps would have cut their hands off if only they could please her. When the gentle men used to see her, they'd hang about an follow her, an she'd walk past them and through them like they was nothing. Then I see her at the Palmer a holding out like against some sorrow. I think the diggers there were mad about her. Many an many a cove walked miles round when they need'nt a done, jest to see her. I was lucky enough *� (smiling dreamily) 'to do her more nor one good turn in Victoria, an she said often an often she liked little Bill Bartley, not thinkin she was wiiinin me out of myself, an tuinin my head till I could do nothin for thinkin of her, an could'nt stay away from where she were� jest only to sit and watch her an know I was in the same house as her, or a doin something for her, that was all I wanted. He's gone to find her, sir, is the winner of the Narrguminio steeple, an he's a wearin her likeness at his heart. It was the first time I envied anything, but I envied that. She often said she liked honest little Bill � true as death. You jest ask her, if you're a goin there, what she thinks of Bill Bartley. If he brings her down, which he's goin to try, they'll call an see me, an if they don't see me I'll be in the ground over there. You can see the railings from this window. Maybe you'll ask them, sir, just as a last favour, to go to the ground, if only once, an there's a letter in my pocket for her, if I'm took over there afore she comes.' His questioner listened on compassionately, recognising some distant chain of sympathy between them, and gather ing his information as it came. Poor little Bartley had the weak garrulous ness of febrile excitement, and he spoke on without a sense of effort. ' He were not a goin by steamer ; he took horses by the blazed track, an that's the way he'll come down � to keep clear of people. Such were his intention. I aint bin on the track myself, but I heard say it was plain enough, an he's a good bushman. So you're goin after him, or more likely goin to meet him, if he's lucky ? The blacks that way aint to be trusted. � Put my head up a bit, sir.' Fitzgerald told the man, who lay sick unto death, that a friend of his was coming out to join him who had travelled in Queensland many years ago, and as soon as he arrived they would start together. Bartley began to pick athis bedclothes vacantly. ' She'll be as bright as ever, but there aint no understandin her. She'll hold him off the way she did other gents, and win him hands down. If she was only here now. I could see her again, an if she laughed at me � all the same � I'd tell her what I think. With her face watchin of me, I could start all right on the journey over there, but I aint got much stay in me, an I feel wearin down to sleep, like what I feel when coming from the mines above, an seem her in a kind of dream. Maybe you'd better take the pocket-book now, sir. I feel like talMn to myself a long way off; that aint a good sign; take it now, it'll tell her what I'd a told her if she were sittin there in your place � an it's honest truth. ' Bartley,' says she to me, puttin her land out an givin it me, like as if she were makin me some thing great, ' You've been true an faithful to me ; there aint many of them as is that, but you never change, Bartley ; I like you better than them all ' � true as death.' Even then, on the brink as he was, before taking the steps into the darkness that has no region or record of time, his wan face burned up, and his large unquiet eyes grew bright. The day was soft and balmy in the ward, and the noises of birds came in cheerily : here and there were shadows, and distant sounds from other parts of the building came to them like quiet visitors as death gathered. ' Anonlythink of it now. Years ago I got the Hermit for a mount. He was well rode, though I say it, an she said if I win she'd give a horseshoe pin what she had, an she'd back me. I'd a rode a elephant to please her, but Hermit won a grand horse. The pin's in the pocket-book too, sir, and a neck ribbon what she lost, an never could find. She litUe thought I took it Just behind them rail ings over there � that? s where they'll hev to come.' His weak voice toned down to whispers, and fluttered at last to silence. In the pause that filled the room the only motion was the regular picking of the weak transparent fingers at the counterpane ; but by-and-bye that ceased, and there was no sound at all to gauge the quiet. While the hush lay thus curtaining: everything with its solemnity� while there seemed a standing still of the day's brightness as it came in and the shadows from without moved stealingly, Bill Bartley'fs b'fe passed out to God who gave it, forsaking hi 

 open eves looking over there where the palings were, and where 'thty were to revisit him, if only once. The change came like sleep as the faithful big soul went forth to the nt-w life. , , , , . , Fitzpcrfild hnd only looked on death once before, but he knew the peace it brought, and when he saw the little face untroubled by a thought, and the features growing pale av& pure, he knew that the eyes held no aght, and the humble love that had possessed them had for ever ceased from troubling. He took the dead man's pocket-book, and found the letter lbnrc beside it, the tarnished horseshoe pin, and a light-blue ribbon folded. The letter was addressed ' Miss Shorter, to be kinely given by bearer.' On the first page of the book was written, in a large school-boy hand, William Bartley it is my name, England it is my nation, Vic toria it is my dwelling-place, an heaven my expectation.' Three davs after the earth had been laid on the plain coffin Fitzgerald stood waiting and watching beside the mangrove-fringed river to where the blue waters and the blue sky parted. Beyond the undulating grounds and the pleasant houses that banked the stream there came sudden round specks like the wings of dark birds, and they grew larger and nearer to show that it was but the labouring steamship coughing grime on the day. From the dimen sions of a man's hand the big toiler sat on the sea-line like a blot of ink, and came spluttering out its 6obs like a tired swimmer, with the breezy look of ft journey on it. It travelled on without pause, blew the stream of soot that flowed from her like an unclean thing lazily coiling on the pure air, and unrolling into spent lines, to disappear like a forgiven sin. Bryan detected the square figure of Mr. James Brown leaning over the side, with his face turned to where he stood. He put up his bind as a signal of re cognition, and then mixed with the rest of the passengers. He had on a coarse straw hat, and his eyes were nearly hidden below the broad leaf, but they showed a gleam below the shade as he stepped on shore carrying a long parcel. , ' So, boy, ye'r stranded an waitin, are ye ? So much tn& better. There's some go here yet, an I know the country.' He Rpokc low, but squared himself befere his friend to exhibit the habitation of the 'go,' and there seemed plenty of room for it in hie deep chest, his long arms, and sturdy legs. ' There's a parcel of minavellins I bought in Sydney wot we'll want. Hev ye heard anything more ? ' ' He'B on the overland track to the Palmer somewhere, whether alive or dead.' ' Whew,' whistled Mr. Brown ; ' that aint a holiday trip by no means. The blacks up there don't say no more prayers nor they kin help, and they ought to be good too � they et all the missionaries as ever went among 'em. But yer lookin all right, boy ; none o' the darned fevers hev crooked ye yet.' They -walked together to a quiet lodging-house where Fitzgerald was staying, and agreed to purchase horses and start on the journey at once. ' How did you read my letter ? ' Fitzgerald inquired on the following day. ' Never read a word of it, lad. The lady sent out a groom or something to tell me as ye wanted to see me at Mindorf, or leastways to give me a bit ot a message, so he said ; an next day we got in. Lord bless ye, she met me in the hall, and took me up to a room full of books, an she eat down beside me an read the letter over, only some places she skipped, not bein proper wrote, she said, as soft an kind as a little girl. I did'nt think there was any of that sort nowadays. She's good, boy, take yer davey o'1 that.' ' Did you ever see such a handsome face ? ' 'Well, responded Mr. James Brown, with a critical' retrospect in his expression; 'hstnsim is. as hansim does, and hansim she does. I hev seen a splendider face^Slater's girl it were, but it was the only one I see before it � least- ways to my mind.' ' I don't believe you.' ' I aint going to argue. Ye've jest got my notion. It's proud, an soft like, an very winnin,' replied Mr. Brown, biting- at a knot on the twine that tied his long parcels ' This here's two guns wot loads at the starn. I shot 'em both � they're nippers. There aint no trouble to load 'em, an if we're lucky we'll raffle 'em when we git back.' The next morning, before the sun was up, they were among the trees and out beyond the rolling lands, to where flowers grew beside the warm waters. They were away from the mangrove swamps, and far towards the open, car peted with long grass and clothed with heavy shade. Brown spoke like a boy out for a holiday. For the first time he told Fitzgerald of a bush fire near the old hut, and of the terrible misery he knew, when he had like to die on these - lands, further on, living on lizards and water for days together. ' It's not the hunger niore'n the quiet wot sets coves; mad in the bush. Seem'd s'if the world was, stopped, an ye was all wot was left : when a bird passed, it looked flyin out of it after the rest, an if a alligator crawled up out of the river, it looked like' the fust o' the batch wot was a ' comin in their place. , Then there come voices all roun � voices of dead mates answerin � they wasn't dead, no' more'n you � an laughin � an they keep at ye till ye see them� hanged mates with halters, an ciyin women with blood on their breasts keepin ye company. It were all fancy, I know,' he murmured, shuddering, �? but they nearly fanciel me along of 'em. I were jest agoin to lie down among 'em, when a choppin of wood caught me, an I followed the sound.' ' Brown rode on in a bee's-line, with the unfailing instinct of a bushman. His eyes were never at rest, and his atten tion absorbed. Towards the close of the second day he became restless, and mechanically fumbled at his gun. It was a shadow that he saw flit past among the trees that made him take the gun from its rest and lay it before him on the saddle. ' Like as not the niggerR is about here, an there aint no use in being caught nappin. Keep yerself ready, boy, there's no knowin.' After a long silence, undisturbed by the almost inaudible sound of the horses' feet on the turf, he 6poke again quickly � 'Thought I wasn't mistook,. D'ye see that cedar an the roun black lump on the side ? Watch how it moves. Durn the nigger, do he take us for new chums ? Steddy � git off, git off quick, Bryan.' ' The pronunciation of the last word was full of anxious ? meaning, and in a moment the sun was shining on the empty saddle seats. What looked like a tuft of parallel spears shot out and! quivered past where the riders stood. If there was any pssibility of arriving at an estimate of Mr. Brown's feel ings at any time, then, both satisfaction and pleasure were ? expressed by his voice as he spoke above his busy hands. ' This here dodge of getting off the horse an a shieldin . yerself was shown me by a Yankee. He used to say niggers - was varmint. Lord, couldn't he pot 'em. Don't put the barl on the saddle ; put it acrost the withers, like mine � that's best. Ye see, them devils see a glint on iron faster nor we do, and when ye shoot don't move the gun ; the less move the less sparklinp that's ' ? The first report rang out, and as part and parcel of the thia sting the slumberous ? '?? air got, something that had looked like a blackened stump I tottered forward and disappeared in the high grass. 'I was a goin to say, that's the beauty of these guns � jest stick a pill in the end an yer right again.' His small eyes were gleamingjas the action 'of his hand followed his words. 'An here we are again, right as ninepence. Turn quietly to that tree on yer left, Bryan, an take good aim; it's expensive a losing of ammunition when spears or lead is the only exchange. Durn ye, ye kin shoot better nor that ; wot are ye doin playin -with ' ? Again Mr. Brown was silent for an instant, but his sen tence was taken up by the deadly weapon, and an arm that had thrown a badly aimed spear developed from behind some brushwood into broad bronze shoulders, glistening as theyfell. 'That cove's in his war grace. Look here, no more j foolin' ' Keeping up his criticisms�*' This ycre. party hev done for poor Mivers, safe as houses; that's wot makes 'em so bold. . We'll lie here if we don't knock a few on 'em over.' The discharges had created a beb'ef in the minds of the savages that the danger of the weapons was gone, and there I seemed a figure pushed from every tree as a flight of spears, I some wounding and some striking their horses, fell about I mem. I ' Stan still, blow ye,' was Brown's advice to his horse. I Then to Bryan � 'Ye see how it is now, maybe. - Look at I that big fellar a poising of his aim.' Another ping from I the rifle. ' I told ye I would. See him a wheelin on a I tumin down� thought so. If yer want to save yer liffy 1 

 fire�an fiare Mivera, and t'save mine, though not much good.' Brown's hands were busy as he spoke. And I am afraid that the old man, with his afiections And lusts, had got strong hold of the convict. Fitzgerald saw that, in self-defence, he must fire with deliberate aim, and the second report of ilisnfle brought down one of the flitting fclack figures, seeming to sink quietly to rest. ' They can't make out those here staraers. If we lied *� load omarary^ we'd be tomahawked. Now jest to show 'em a bit of skill. Look at that foliar balancin of bisself �n the fork behind the front ones.' -Anotherdharge left the horsed wither, and the black - fellow fell amongst his fellows like a striken bird. That's vbout the Sast, Bryan, boy; that Ions; shot'll surprise the domed corrohoree. See how -feey go. I will say this's -the bestigun wot I ever fired, an feere's a last mutder ; go Sn/dnrnye' � to the cartridge. ? There was a young native who had got behind the rest, ?and he was covered as the mat spoke. Another sound oe. the evening, and another life fell to it. The young dusky ?warrior threw up his arms and fell forward on tike shoulders of another in advance, but -the tatter clubbed him down with his nolla, and ran on. 'sLook here, Bryan, Uie*earch aint scarcely worth follerin. Mivers is done ; that tfhere crowd has been at him, or they TffOtBdn't a stood so well afore us. I suppose ye thSnk,' the?said, with his chin on his hands, looking from, the ^saddle contemplatively, ''-tbat them niggers Sb all killed. Jsook at the grass tnovin 'ever there : they're crawlin. off as well as they can. It'll ifee a long spell afore -they git water� that's a comfort. Wei tfine guns ! I aiat a goin t'raffle onine. These here guns hev saved our skins.' They went over to *wiere the blackfellows had ambushed, and found but two. T&erc wcie stains of 'blood and ruts in the crop of grass -�&si-e they stood, skewing the direction taken by the wounded. All the tracks of the broken warriors dragging amongst the grass wore :parallel, and in the direction nearest to water, away from where the infernal barrels of civilization looked at .them over the steady horses. One of those tbat lay dead had his arm below his face, and a hand bruised down beneath it. There was a red track from the body to the grass, and a big 'dot of blood beside him. ' That's tfhe cove wot come from the tree, an only a chance shot tool' The sun was dinning like fire on the -place, burning with the angry flaorrings of a carbuncle 'on the prone figures, and lending redder red to the blood that smeared the grass. 'We're safe enough now,' Mr. Brown informed his friend. 'T8iere''ontbeone on 'em -seen in this part for months.' ' How about Mivers ?' ' I'm afraid' the young fellar hes'coine to grief. We kin '? light a fire tfnjght, boy,' Chatter XXXII- � In which cthb Journeyings or ; Mivesis and Miss Shouttbr ahe concluded. ,' ' Only.a*couple of days,' Mivers had said. ' The danger ; was over, and the rest but qaiet travelling to the town. ; There was no' need to struggle on beyond the strength of ? their horsas. Caution was no longer so imperative. The. journey ihad1 been the pleasantest he had ever known, and . there wastnow scarce need to shun the belt of trees. Tkey could see where the fences were away out beyond them. They were safe at least.' . . : But &ey;had scarcely mounted, when a i\\ �ure stood �ut amongst :th& brown grass, and a spear swept icross Mivers' : breast for into the shoulder of Margaret iS'iorter. The nervous arm that flung it was scarcely dovji before the muEzle�f Mivers' gun threw out its charge, and the blaok fellow �prang upwards, then turned dizzily, and tried 'to run ; lie swayed over the ground as though drunken, and reeled 'down in a coppice of brush. Miss Shorter feeld herself -straight when the wound came, but, like the aborigine, she swayed over upon her horse. Then she slipped to' the ground, and looked faintingly at the lanoeof wood tbat 'dragged behind her. Mivcrs was by her and had bold' of 'the weapon, which he pulled away in a feeiing of bewilderment, and the blood spread and broadened in a creeping stain upon her. drees. 44 Yoii?re wounded, . you're wounded, and your bloed is comiag-t-all through me. Bear up, bear up, for the love of heaven; allwillyetbcwell.' Bis arms-met round her and carried her he knew mot where, as 'though she hod been an infant. Over before them was. a shadow from broad leaves, and he took 'her there, ?entreating her, for heaven's sake, if not for Ms, to hear up. .He hardly noticed the new smile that had ccme to her face,' or the lassitude of her limbs and figure. The horses were browsing in 'the sun, and he slipped through the yielding grass, carrying her with indescribable care where the nearest shadow was in that weary land. Borne thus, tfhe looked only at ibis eyes, but the depth of hers was shadowed with thoughts, &nd had a calm that was easily read. ?' This is right,' she said, weakly, down by the tree trunk. ' Luke, I have -something to tell you.' She turned all the marvellous gift of her beauty to him in something like a mute appeal, and he, broken and sob bing with his dry eyes, sat her down as she asked and kissed&er. He had scarce a word to speak because of his fear, Tmt his eyes bunted strangely between his shaking sobs. 44 Aaid there is no help to be had in this cursed place, --d what am I to do to save you and to ease your pain F { blood must be coming still, for the stain is widenin shall goimad, my love, my love.' He ihrew himself before her on the ground, shj strange contrast by his wild face to that of the mini of the girl, that seemed to grow purer and fairer -is \\\\^ grew and crept over her -breast. Her hand \\ ????'- , his shoulder with a fond familiar meaning, br.i . hac word to give. He lookedatt her dazed and ft t itcned, a� j a condemned man at the dock that will tell hi � v hen the gallows will beneath his feet, and the white-fa*. '� expec tant witnesses around, him. He lay before her, propped up by his arms, and looking at her face with limitless suffering in his. His great pain pained her. 41 Don't suffer so much, Luke. My Luke, always mine, 4 till the sea gives up its dead.' ' 41 Margaret, Margaret, you remember the verses you taught me now. Will you die, will you die ? ' He dropped his face upon her knees in a boy's abandon ment of sorrow, and it was only when the eloquent search ing hand found him that he looked up to listen. 41 This as the best ending. When I saw you first, at the inn, behind us I felt a scare as of death upon me for a moment, because it came to me we should never part in life any more. So best, Luke. But you know none of the story yet. One object of my father in taking that hovel at Narrgummie was to entrap you ; the other, to lend money. He got me to help him. lit sounds all like a story, but it 'is true. He knew, and I knew, that I was fairer to look at than other women, and he gave me the mission you know of now. I have succeeded.' She smiled tenderly, and one hand wandered down upon his that was supporting him before her and trembling. ' Pelan was invited to make your acquaintance and win your money.' 'Who is Pelan?' ' It was Pelan who shared his money with my father when we were all starving, and when your father refused to send down the wages due to mine. He had broken my father's legs with a crowbar somehow, and sent him down to us in Melbourne a cripple and a burthen. One night, when my mother was delirious with want and fever, I was told to go to the theatre with Pelan. We left my father staring at the floor and cursing yours with such curses as only desperate men can utter � and then the mistake of my life came, and I am not fitted to be your wife, Luke. My father's name is Slater, and by such is he known to yours ; and now the ' by-and-bye ' has come, and you know all.' She seemed to gather strength for this, and half raised herself to look at him, broadening the stain sadly by the effort. 'And now that I love you more than women love, we are to part. Oh ! Luke, say you forgive me.' He did not answer ; only with a savage tenderness he lifted her on his knees aud clung to her. His great eyes seemed to burn into hers, and he pressed her to his breast, not thinking that the blood print was still getting bigger. The dying woman made an effort to put her arm up on his neck ; she smiled at him with something of the beauty of another sphere in her face. ' You forgive me. I fell once� but I fell, I fell.' 41 Forgive you ! ' he shouted ; I'll find you on the shores beyond and claim you there. Forgive you, my love � say you are my own.' She clasped her aims on his neck and kissed him, and the 

 eyes that held such depths above her unsearchable trouble faded as she passed in his embrace into the life that is to be revealed. As she lay thus he made no sign, but looked at the face which was growing quiet so fast. He placed his face beside it, but there was no weeping. The bronze cheek lay touching the one that had faded to marble pallor. With a kind of vacant shock, Mivers thought that he oould not remember the time w&en he had prayed to God. But he threw off bis hat sow, and sat with the dead in his embrace and prayed. lam certain his words were far from the orthodox form, and that he was kieontably behind in the authorised style of address to die Power that dwelt above and around him. Bat if prayer is the soul's desire, he prayed with an earnest ness that obtained tecord, and he rocked with her there iike a weak and mourning mother. The -sun passed away and the night came, but there was no alteration. He felt her growing cold to. his arms, but he swaved her to rest and her face, and in fids frenzy cursed all things and begged that he might net live. It was thus the morning rose to him, and in. the light of sunrise he mechanically said a prayer again. The plains and trees were yellow as he crooned his petition above the dead. Then he placed her as she had asked to be placed, resting against the tree trunk, and waited before her upon fats hands as when she had spoken� waiting expectingly for words. Why not ? Her face was beautiful as it ever was, and the sun was in her hair as at used to be ; why nofthe words, and why no movement �af arms or face ? So he waited staringly before her for fee love she had spoken, and so the insane wish held him breathing at her face, and burning it with. Ms eyes. Ml ! she but slept. He took her again in his arms, and sartudown praying, in ibis poor fashion, that her eoul might rest in heaven, axtdtthat he might follow thereto take Bier, his own love, fit to be his wife, and driven to wrong toy his own father. So to his Father that was in heaven 'he told his troubles an childish sentences. Hie hat, that lhad been cast awqy ?that he might petition God, lay bruised beyond the shade. He looked out with a lowering faoe'on the book of the 'earth before him while he held her. Tfaeihorses had wandered away, but he would stay there. Tfce fitain had deepened'^ rom red to black upon her breast, and'all the world held'df her he held� thank God far that. Her last words and 'thoughts and love were his � again thank God. So would 'they never part. She had said it �his Margaret, with those lips and eyes of hers. She had-spoken it. He would rest with her there, and join her seen. -He looked up at two horsemen who rode to where he was, but bent to his rocking and tenderness of care again. My. (Brown alighted without any explanation, and beckoned his companion to follow his example. ' Look here,' when away from where Mivers -cat, -'he's alive, that's move nor I ever thought to find i but it's a ease, I'm afraid. He has got a dead woman there in his arms. It will be the hardest part of the task to git him away. Reglar anad he is. Why didn't they spear him too 't It'd a bla better.' Old Brown, swinging his arm down in deprecation, wondered how such things could come about, and;God in the sky above them. '? He's gone cranky, an notfcin we kin do '11 show him that it's only clay he's a nurain of. She must be buried here, an we must git him away, if we 6trap him to one ef his horses grazin out there. Come.' The convict stood staring at the warm suncy hair and at the face of thetiead. ' I know her,' he spoke solemnly, rising from Hie scrutiny; 'that there girl is Slater's daughter. TJiere aint no mistakin her face; it were the finest ever seen. And they together like tfcie ! It's like a kind o' providence o' God. There's the girl I meant,' pointing at the figure, ' wot no face come near to, an we've come to see her dead.' Fitzgerald put his hand on the shoulders of Mivers and shook him. ' Till the-sea gives up its dead.' ' But you know me, Luke. When you were floating down the waterhole at Reedy Creek I saved your life. You know me now. She's dead, Luke ; we'll* bury her here What is the use of keeping her like that ? She'll sleep and wait for you. We have come for you. I thiidryour father is dying over there, and waiting to see you -once before he follows herl' Mivers looked up with some sense of dim knowledge, but bent forward again and repeated his wail. Brown camp to them without speaking, and took the figure from Mivers with gentle force, telling him,, as he sat listless and speechless, that yonder Maggie .Slater was a waiting of him. He ran over to the cedars in such baste that the old man looked dimly after him, while Fitzgerald followed and took him round to corners and .-shades, and called upon her among the trunks. Brown digged the grave, and bent above it. ' Not that it's anything to me,' justifying Us weakness, ' but she were the finest woman lever see. Look at her hair. An I knew her� daughter of Slater. Ah ? no blame ?to poor Slater.' He laid her in the shallow excavation, and reverently placed a large sheet of bark to protect the breast and face, while wondering vaguely at tfie dispensations 4hat came from above. He stamped upon the soiL and cohered the earth with leaves and bark � below the big tree, that would cast its shade to guard the daisies over her, and shield away the sobbing rain in the waiting for the resurrection and the life. Mtvere wandered about mad-eyed after a want that was -escaping .him. When he stopped to think, he could not. The 'Clearness of his memory was retreating before fever. ri-eparjty travelled quickly back, and the stricken man was n lying in the bed that Bartley had tenanted. . And :--n the unrest of the restless life was at rest too beyond 1 mKngs where the jockey lay, the men turned home to tiheold squatter in the house at Mindorf that he was ildlees. ___^^___^^^^^^^__
