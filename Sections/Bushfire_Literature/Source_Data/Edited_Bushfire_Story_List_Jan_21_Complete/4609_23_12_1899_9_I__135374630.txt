 "Not in svater or in wine C. Can.I drown these cares of ilne.": " - , lctor J. Daley.-.' SfOPfLE IN dIEfIMEiRI' hii commenced to whisper cauti-: ously to each other that Dlck? Trevor was beginning to go down-bill. He.himself was as yet unconsclous of any rotro-' grade xovement; indeed, he lhad done little more than paause on the upward path, and glance over his shoulder towards that delectable land which sinks so Imperceptibly away fromn the road to coniln ence, which every young man is suppse.d to attempt. lIe had come to Australia full of ambition tand energy; and had been fortunate enough to very speedily obtain a situation iti an up-couentry bank. Here was no scope for anmbition; and but little need foruenergy; so after a while.Dick began: to rest upon his. oars and let hiniself drift. Exlsteihee In the ltttle township flo\\ired so tuietly, so mono tonously tlhat it was often hardl to tell in which direction' the subtle current ran. But the river of'life, which bears all humanity on its broad. breast, sweeps ever steadily downwards to' oblivion and destructlon. And the souls cast panon its watersmust row over, steadily, unceasiigly, against the stream to reach the source and fountain bead,' which' is eternal life. Let them but rest an instant fromt that upward striving, and they 'are Iorne backr' swiftly towards the cataracts that. will swamp' them, tdo wards.that dark cavern into which the river' rushes and forevyer dlsappears. As for Dick, a handsome boy who came straight from an Ettglish 'public school and looked particularly distinguished aghinst the backgroond. of MIrnerimer soeiety, Fate seemed too much for him. His ambition faded in the dead level of his daily round, antl his energy flagged under the ?ryln'g climate. He hIad grown into thie habit of laying all his shortcomings and miodemean ours on that scapegoat of tropical countries, climate, and was In somne danger of sur rendering to it his conscience and.indeed his ilnmortal soul. Conscience, however, told him that the lleadacho with which he'wokle on Christmas morning was not entirely the fault of eli mate. To be strictly correct,' the flie woltke him, and his head ached so that he turned frotm tile light and closed his eyes again rwith a groan.. Then in a little while he re melmbered that it wes Christmas Day; Ihe thad a brief vision of an English rectory with the soft snow piled on door and win dow ledge, and then he sat up and looked round with a vague sense of expectation. But he was disappointed. The siorning slla was shining red through a coppery haze of bush fire smolke; the vacant green op posite, now burnt bare and brotwn by lengthy drought, was still profusely stud ded with the townshipl's miscellaneous rub bish, and the sole signs of Yuletide were half-a-dozen tall gumn saplings lashed to thie vteurtdahl posts of the hotel. It was barely six o'clock, but atything weas better than the stuffy bedroom, its glaring sunshine and0 its flies, so Dick lounged languidly dewnstatirs i search of a bath. He roused thile venerable boots frotm hIis aInr in the vicinity of the stables; and while that an cient filled tile shower for him 'he loitered about tlhe yaril looltilg idly hito the life bIehind the scenes of the bush hotel. This is nearly always a fatal proceeding for anyone who wialles to endure existence cieerfully in such an establishment. Of course tllere are many honourable excep tions, ltut usually It is a case of "What the eye does not see," &c. In this Caseo Dick saw in the kitchen a dingy Chinese oook stirring the porridge with an equally dingy piot-sticlk, and snmoklting a very strong pipe over the decoction. 1ie listened stolidly, as he stirred, to the shrill reproaches of Vera, the landlady's pretty daugllter, who stood there, in soiled pink wrapper and with tlhe inevitable curling irons in her hair, loolk ing sallow and sour in the garish light. From tile middle of the floor, with her skirts gathered up round her, she was pointing- with all lhr dlamnond rings on-to the ma tutinal steal, left, alas! all uncovered to tite flirs! Dtick shluddered, and instantly decided that neither steak nor porridge was for him that miorning; neither was Vera-but hIere ihe abruptly strove to drown nn.inconvenlent rush of mtemories beneath the meagre shower. But thie water only washed away the cobwebs from his brain, and he rc membered quite an appalling amount as he finished dressing. Even .tlle most leisurely toilet musme in time be compltedto; breaklfast was noi\\to be thought of, and his mind turned rathdr too readily to the idea of a brandy and-soda. This beverage haid formed his morning repast on mor 'thani oel occasion, and Ihe had excused the pro ceeding by charging it to his account against thle climate. But in the bar', Fate still seemed to follow him. The ublquitous Sly was there busily suiciding in tihe dirty glasses, and as the blear-eyed barman, who hIad, too, evidently been Ikeeping up Christ mss Eve, proceeded to rectify matters withl the minimum of water and a doubtful towell Dick beat a hasty retreat. He flung him self clear of the hotel, and started walking no the hill. Tall and broad-shouldered, he looked very lhandsome as he strode along, for his irritation lent him energy, and he hiad not yet forgotten htow to walkl In n splte of the climate . ," ? ,. .. Habit led him up to the schoolhouse, for the schoolmaster was the greatest friend he had in the town. Entering by the back w'ay, as he wes accustomned to do, his Jaded eyes were 'gldtdened by the prettlest tInk leau In all the district on that sultry sim Suer morning. On a vine-clad back verandah, shaded'by the detached kitchen, stood a bath-tub. In the tub kiicked and'gurgled a happy baby, while above him bent a laughing girl, sllashing the water over his head, and catching the flying drops on' her rippling brown hailr and lovely tlired' face.':'Ao the footsteps came round the end of the kltchlien, she did not look up, but becoming aware of masculine boots and a certain' amount of light grey tweed, she exclaimed enthusi astically, "Oh, Phil, isn't he 'a love! 'iHe can't bear to come out! It won't lhurt him,. I'n sure, for a little longer, and'ho'll be as hot as ever when he is dried.' Not re celiving the fathelly admonition she ex pected from Phil regarding his.infant son, she raised her eyes, to encounter the enm barrasscd gaze of a stralnge young man, who sremed undtlecided whether to run away or stand his greuit. hut there was nothing undecided iabout lher. In one instant the baby was snatched into a large towel with a suddenness that arretsted his srluclk of remonstrance, and the two disnppeared into the house, leaIving Dick gazing bewildered at the empty tub. "Hiullo, old fellow! A merry Christmas to you!" and'Phil crossed over'at that mo ment from the school-room, just as his wife came oul ot of the house, Idughlng, to carry It a pile of baby clotlhest beside the tub. "I am afraid I am intrutding on you this morning, Mirs. Barton; I did not kInow youS had a visitor. Youi and Phil have always made me so welcome that you have quite spoilt me." Dick was distinctly homesickl with the seatiment of Christnstt; he lookled peonsive tand spoke with thie lanugutid, subdued air of a prilcely exile. He was unconsclously somlewhitt dtlishlonest in tie tone hlie adpoted, for inluchi of his languor andt melanlcholy Wore born of tile night before, and of the trouble lls folly had brought home to him. But the simple kIlndly hearts of Phil and his wife went out to him, and they con tutied tie spoilling process of which lihe spok0e so gratefully. "Ohi, Polly! Shle only came ip yesor day. Yoll knew we expected her, didn't you?" said ItMrs. Phl--tPhiIl was "Phil" to the better half of the tdwn atd his wifo was always spoklen of as Mrs. Phil. "I say, Maitey, is breakfast almost ready," ainterposed Phitl, with tact. "I have been walitihg most patiently to be called to it Te're real lazy people int the holidays, Trev." "Ye's, we're just ready," she answered. "Come In, won't you, and have some break fast with' usi," sllu askled Dick as if begging soatl great favour. sIlic detnPraqd annd protested, but Phil 'would taihe no dulial, so hle weot in withl thelm, and sat down to the breklifast-table. There were three or fotur piretty clhildren roulidl it, tile young con tander of ilhe buth sat in a high hlilir near hisi father, and there was Polly, Aiuntie I'olly, who was Prin anld dignificedt when Introdulced to Phil, ibut who hllad a lovely colour l heir soft cheeks, and wrinleslr crushetId in thce sleeves of her blouse wihere they had bhenr,rolled pl to batlh the baby. Andt Dickle was on his dignity, too, for as he sat down hie had lheard Polly, in the next room, oblivious of the thin wooden partl tlon, aski sarcastically of her sister-in-law,

But he lovpd the children, and his kind little atten tlons to theml soon won Polly's goodwill, and beforeothe meal was over she'was chat tlng quite amiably with him. , Then after :breakfast Phil took him over to the school verandah-It was too hot to go for-a walk-and they read, smoked, and ynarned till little Elsia canme to summon her father to go to church. And all this time Dick had not found courage to tell Phil his troubles,- as hn:had intended. But he went to church, where he sat be side Polly, and he had grown provincial enough to feel glad that people should'see him with this fair sweet girl on her first appearance there. But when- theo-service was over-.he steadfaistly tfaced the hotel again,. thlugh libslpitiible.Phil pressed itmin to conme l?hick fdr'dlnner. Vdein was watefilnsgfio:im- with honeyed smiles and in all her.Christmas bravery., Her hair was'; elaborately-dressed,-her com-' plexion, attended :to--I. do not klnow thibs exact expreosslo for that mysterious opera tion-and she' was acl tired' li the airiett of muslins and.decorated with the pales? of groenu sathi'ribboas. But thaiugh her eyes gleamed as-brightly, as 'her diamonds, Dick could not forget his early mornlng'view of her, dand he wondered 'wlth dismay if he woluldsho explected to add to the number of Ithoso flashlng rings. After' the hot, heavy Christmas diner he escaped to his room under pIlea of writing, to his people at home, andl Vera let him go with it self-complacent eonscitbu .smile.,'siy!ng' ~grdchly,"You inuist tell them how awfully nice I am, you kInow." . 'The Words staggered him, and he reallsed lore fully than ever the extent-of-his folly of the previous night. 'Veronica Callaghan! T'ihe very name seemed niore than engugh in his revulsion of 'feeling. How eduld he write hoineand tell 1his aristocatle motlier, his refined and fastidious father, that he was 'engaged to a glrl named Veronica Cal Iaghan, and-that her mother kept the hotel at which he boarded. So he sat through tile stifling heat of that long, dreary-Christmas hfternoon before his desk, his head between his hands, thnining and thinking, and writ ing-nothing. At last he riose,' roclless and defiant of Fate, and joined Vera in the' driwin'ig-room. She was pouting at his long absence, so tley. had. their first lovers' quarrel and then made it up. After which he sat fanning her, and sipping iced something or other, nntil the fierce and self-assertive asun finally went down, fgllhting to tihe last for mastery over a mass of sulphsrous'cloud in the west. Then they went out for a drive, and when they retlrned, late for ten,, Dick had reach ed that state of obllviousfiess in which he was proud of being envied by all the fel lows at the table, as thie winner of the proet tiest girl in the district. And he meant to buy a diamond ring, too, that would eclipse all the others in Vera's possession, only un fortunately he had not the necessary money. So he set to work to try and gain It by the extremely unlikely method of gamnbling for it; and he finally closed his eyes after this long Chlristmnas Day with a dull confused impression tlhat he was further off attaln ilg it than evgi~., "Choose who 1will the wiser part I bavd heldli.isi heart to heart." -Victor J. Daley. During the following week Dick paid more than one visit to the school house, but did not find sutllclent courage to makte a confldant of Phil. Polly was generally to be seen playing with the chiltren or nursing thCe baby boy, and Dlick's fast girowsilng admiration drew comlparisons be tween hter simplicity and beauty and Vera's naffected elegance. But there were no more natatoi:lal displays. During thle week, however, tile news of his engagement spread about the town, and lhe was made to feel supremely miser able. The men scaircely hid their contemp tuous \\namusement as they congratulated him, and the ladies of tlheo tennis club treat ed him wlth a cold and ceremonious polite aess. There was a rlding party to the station, and he was not invited to join it; in short, hie explerienced all the petty irri tations incidental to losing caste in a con servatlive little up-country town. -And now to crown all his sorrows, on' New Year's Eve, Phil, having heard the news Incidelntally, was talking seriously to himn, takiug him to task. Phil was hurt that Dick had not confided In him, and he was distinctly out of temper. ' At last, after he had expressed himself somewhat freoly, Dice said, "Never mind slating me now, old man, but for heaven's sake, tell me .what I had better do.',' "Do!" said Phil, hotly.' "Yourmust stick to her now you've committed yourself ; you can't make a fool osfthe girl.now. Indeed," with a short laugh, "she'll stick to 'you, for peope likto that think so much of marry ing what they call' a gentleman."' "Thanks,'.' literposed Dick ironically. "Well, it's true," went on Phil, too earnest'to inotice trifles of ambiguity. "Old MIrs. Callaoscan has said over and over again that hier daughter--an educated lady she calls her-must marry a gentleman." S"But I am not .in a 'cosltion to marry, objected poor Dietsk, "I'm in debt' arid- "You're too young, you poor young fool,' you rhould never have been trusted aout of your mother's sight,'bnt that does not matter to them; they have the mosey and you have the name and connections. The old lady! Is-boasting to everyone over the bar codliter that her girl 'Veronlca is on 'gaged to marry a rale gintleman.' ' Dick winced as Plil mimicked' hisl, fu ture moeher-in-law's tone and accent; but ho had yet :a'iothe?r rievanc:ve. 'Sho:-is sucha filtt;' too, you inow," he went on, 'relerring, It is to be supposed, to the dan ghter, not'the maotlsr.

He held her hands fact and bent down close to the lovely laughilg face. .In another nioment she would have hbeeii!clasped closely In his arms, but before th'atlhdrd arrule in fcr milld the mocking vision of Vera; she hdaehel away the res training hands and fled Indoors, and as she lay sloeepless all through that breathless summer night, she shed tears of anger nd pity for herslf--and for Dick. But now more frequently thafi over oCuY foolish Dick might be fotud in n certailf back parlour of the hotel with a company Of choice spirits and sundry acim 3 I of cards... The rattle of dice might he heard in the small morning hours, and after every such night Dick looked more seedy and haggard tllan ever. It was well for the father and mother in that far-off Eng lish factory that they could not see their. boy Just then,. The, more he gambled the more despe rate Igrew 'his affairs, which goes without saying, for of course he was aso.yet only a pigeon: In time, if he held-on" his way, he might develop hawk-like propensities, andi at least hold his own in the foul game 'of: plunder. Dick himself ctuld not remembherexactly Idw or when his first temptation came, It was a mere casual thought., or. fainlnt sug gestion floating ha?illy acroes lils'cohscl ousness, a recollectlon that other fellows, pressed for money like himself, had bor rowed without muchl formality' from the bank, always of course with the intention of replacing-the money as soon as thby won itiback. "they were fools,' thought Dick, "fqr l.hey know that at any moment thein spector might dro, in on thedm." Soon after this the lnsaector "droeped In" to Dick's bank; he found everything In order, iand after peering about for one day and ,art of another, he tookl his depar ture, expDressing his satisfaction 'to the genial manager as hb shook hands with him through the railway carriage window. "Woll, thank. goodness, we're-rid of him for awhilel" was tihe manager's remark to Dick on his return to the oflice. It was after three o'clock, but Dick was doing something to his books. Then with a few critical remarks on their late visitor, the niannaer went'off to have a game of bil liards over at the lihotel, and Dick was left alone. lie was by tills tile urgently in need of some money. Money li- must have in a few days, or.his affairs would become a public scandal, and that he lnow meant his dismissal from tie bank. So the same weary old soplhistrics that have lured so many to their ruin assailed him now In the solitude of the long hlot afternoon. .His luclik must turn soon, it had been so dismally bad for so long; he would be sure to win the money back before thereo was any.chance of the Inspector coin ing again; he had indeed very little choice left, as he would be exposed in a few days if hlie could not raise funds some how. These and otller stock arguments,--so nalpable and threadbare that it is wonderful how long tiley delude so many victims otherwise intelllgent,-travelleci round and round iin his weary brain, till he was' glad to shut sl his books uand leave the bank whoso golden atmosphere seemed to mock at hih. Away from the bank Dickl felt better ; he remembered Phil's former, offer of help, and tie half resolved that if circumstances 

 favoured him, lhe would avail himself of it that night and rid himself of the most pressing of his debts without "borrowlng" from the bank. Accordingly after dari he strolled uo to the school house, and finding no one about,' sat down on the yorandah till sonmeone sholoud appear. :Presently Mrs. Phil came out, and afteir the usual ' greetiig arnd exclamations against the heat, she told him that some man had called to seo.Phil, who was tallk lig to him over on the school verandah. So they chatted for awhile, and Dick list ened wistfully to Polly liisofdo, slnging in 'a soft low voice to the drowsy baby. The lightning i?ihyed 'trout tti horizon, -and there weore great brinks of clouds in the north-west, which rose .lid gathered swiftly as they watclOd thdir,. while the lightning grew morde vivid aid frelquent every mlndlo.

Trhen crune a mighty crash os if the very skies had fallen, and when 

 the two friends could gather their scattered senses they had to scramble from beneath the outlying folilage of a huge prostrate tree, which, struckl by the lightning, had fallen, crushing the fence and snapplng its topmost boughs against the side of the house. And thlle strangers knife was lqulverlng in Dick's left arml, but the stran ~or himself was nlowhere to be seen. Inside the house all was cop(?uiSion for a few Inlt.lnes, . 111 frllghtnoed chlidren weore screaming and IMrs. Phil slas distract ed between them, and terror for her hsus I band outside. PIhilI calmed her fears f0u a momlelt before heo rlshedl away through the shleets of fierce blinding rain for the dcgt.:, for Dick's arl wasl' bileedlng furl Orely. Polly, who, like Dich, had seen n1 heaIlrOt the euarrel from her bedroomt window, came to Dick's assistanfen. >he hound o ligatureotightly above thile 'ouhd, and bravely tried to stanich the blood un til 'the doctor should come. "It was Stewart Donaldson," shoestid'to Dick. "He is our second cousin-hoeused to be a good fellow once,' but he has girown very wild and reckless." "Don't tell me if it hurts' you," said Dick, looking down at her tenderle, for she was trembling, and white even to her; sweet quivering lips, and her words came abruptly and brokenly as if shonhad ?dtlfl culty in speaking them. " . ' "We have not seen him for a long time;" she still wenoqt on, "he used to be in a basnk, but he got' into--Into trouble, and he has never done any good since." , Dick was silent. He thought what a brave little creature she was, and ho-won doreod ow much she still cared for this wild w!cked cousin. Dick would never forget his beautiful evil face and tlhe splen did -ose of'his athletic frame. They had been photograpled on his brain by that as,. ful lightning flash. 'When the doctor came he dressed.' thlo wound,. andl naturally enoughi Inquired what tlhey had b11e0 doing. Phll looked entreatlingly fnt D)ick, and muttered somo thing about "fooling. with a aknife in the storm.". ThIe doctor asked no more-ques tions, liht after giving sundry directions, left the roern, followed 'by Phil, who hept him for some thime talking earnestly oflthe verandah. Phil had forbidden hlls wife to comed into tIle room, for.'e wished to save her from any mlore frighlt and worry that evening if. ~osslble. So Dick was once more left alone with Polly. She busied lherself at first In re-arranging the disord ered roomI, while Diecks longing eyes fol lowed her every movement. Then she ealme andl stood by his chair, nervously rolling and unrolling a bandage the doctor hadi left. "You saved my brother's life," she said at last, softly and tremblinlgly, as she lifted her. eyes from her occupantion, 'whilli tewo great tears welled from their loielv brown depth and dropped upon, his hand. Those tears overcame every barrier., lIe s?nrang from his seat and gathered ?her closely to him with his uninjultredl arm,. "Oh, my love, ny love, that was a small thing to do for you, I lov.e you love, you so!" he whispered, and then he kIissed .her passiollnately on the lns 'agailn and-again, There was a lonllg sweet silence, and then she broke.fron.hm moanlling, "Oh why did you do it?

It seemed symbolic, faoi; truly be had gathered the fruit of his reckless lifo that day. The report of firearms brought theo man ager, the 'sorgeant of police, and all the loafers of thle to~wn crowding itto the bank ing rtoom. Thllere stood Dickt, the revol ver till hangluig in his nerveless hand, gazing downv on the hugo inert 'mass of his opponent.

But he failed. When' left alonIe, he sat holding, his ach iing head between his tands, trying to think things over. How dreadfully his head achid, nsd how suddenly it had all happened. It seemed so awful that he should have killed a man, but porbaps, hIe thouglt wildly, ie was not dead really, and 'he starteid u to see if thle doctor had done everything pos sbl'toi restore him: Then he remembered where he was, aiid how. liolpless..antd he sank down with.'a groant.

The directors of the ?atnk bad arraugedfor his defence, and they had. veryi little fear nas to the resalt of the trial. Hils inost fretquent visitor at the hospitalnll wasn of course Phil. Phil. always cheerful yet nympathetic, brought him various items of;newvs, all of which he accepted with the utmost quiet, almost indifference, for it seemed as if the ofever had burnt out. all emnotion, or at any rate the power of show ing It. From Phil lie learnt that the dead mani's naho btad-'been discovered, and that also a garbled account ofthe affray.-in the' storm had got about the town, chletly, he feared, through his. talkative ,little maid.

Then the intelllgoeht jury, rather ignoring theo. fact of .Donaldson's disguise, tAnd that DI!ck's recognition of hin tookl place after the shsotiug, found him guilty of manslaughter, and he was sentenced to ninello nontlhs' imprisonment in the ntearest country gol. This sentence formed tihe chief topic of discussion and disputo for a few days inIl Merimhe, after . which life flowed on In its usual mototonous way, and Diclk. was "soon forgotton. .LBut theo banki directors were somewhat Indlignant at the verdict recorded.

They also intimatedl thlat another position wotold be found for him on lils release, and they further subscribled for him a handsome
