CYNTHIA'S FOLLY ? ' ? \'bb ? CHAPTER I.\
, ' 'Arif it's meself that's glad 'to see' 'ye, Mr. Brian! .Sure, It's a treat to see any Christian face I1 this hay then lantl, more especially when it's a lace from th' ould country an1 th1 ould home. Ah, they may say what they like about Natal,, an' I don't deny that it's a fine country enough, but' it's riot a patch on ould Ireland after' all!'\
Mrs, Daly paused, a little out, of breath, and looked up at her com panion\'97 a taH, good-looking young man, who, leaning against the door post with his hands 'In his pockets and . a pipe in his mouth, listened 'with placid amusement to' the flood of re miniscences and questions with which she had deluged him during the past hour. He laughed and gave her an approving glance. ' 'That's rlg-ht, Norah, no place (like (the old country, eh? Especially when one's sis or seven 'thousand miles away from it. But you ought not to speak disparagingly of Natal. Tou have done well, you say?' ' 'Very well, Mr. Brian, the Saints be praised,' Norah answered piously, 'an1 I'd be th' last to -grumble, or speak ill o' th1 oenrafrry. An' so your mother an' Miss Kato are at Durban, ye say?' . ; ) 'Yes. It was chiefly on Kate's ac count that we. came. ..She has 'been very dollcate-'lately, and tho doctors re commended a sea-voyage; so as my mother has a sister in Durban, they ?will remain there for a few months, ?while I see a little of the country. I intend to go up to the goldflelds and the diamond mines, and as I promised your brother to look you up and giv\'ab you all the home news, I called here on my way.' - 'An' It was -like your kind heart to think on , it, Mr. Brian, an1 to come 60 far out o' your way to see your ould nurse!' Norah laid her hand affectionately on the young, man's sleeve. 'I do wish Tim had been at home, .but he went to town two days ago on business, an' won't toe back till to-morrow at soonest. We're lavin1 here very ? shortly. We'ye taken a bit o' money, an1 as we've neither; chick nor child, an' only ourselvas to ?work for, wg'vb sold- the ' fawn, and Tim 'has bought a bit1 p'. land nearer th' town, where it -won't b(e quite so lonesome, nor so hard.1' 'I am glad to 'hear- it, for it must be very dull here, but it's a pretty place, all the same,' Brian answered. He was standing by the door of the ?wooden; shantle which Tim Daly, with the assistance of a Kaffir,1 had built 15 years before, under the acacia-trees on the banks of the river. ,: There was . a small( garden ' at one side, stocked with vegetables and fruit trees,' .all planted by, the ? careful' , hands . of -Tim and his wife.. At the other 'was ? a large enclosed cattle-kraal; behind the house was a small plantation, or bush, and 'behind that . the great tractless veldt, which stretched away for miles on a flat, unbroken Surface. There was no prospect In front A,of the house, for at the other side of the river' tall cliffs, dotted here and '.there by a stray patch of grass or clump of mi mosa, rose precipitously ' from the rocky shore, and shut out' all view off ithe country beyond. ? It would be dlffl-' cult , to imagine a more lonely place, Brian thought, as he looked curiously around, and yet Norah and her hus band had endured existence there for 15 years. He' shuddered at the thought. .?,-??..... .. ? .: '. v 'The heat Is very intense this after noon, Norah/' he'.aald; '/'there isn't a- breath .of- air, even 'by , the 'river, ~et' I did not find it unepjtif ortab'ly hot as I rode here. -I think, there must be a ? storm brewing.' ;, ! ' ;: v _ 'very likely,, sir. . !'Tis better than ?usual,' Norah answered, fanning her self vigorously -with .the corner of her. apron. .'An1 what are ; ye; lookln' at, Mr. Brian?' she added, for Brian had started,' raised himself from his lounging attitude, and was looking eagerly across the river, Norah, fol lowing the direction . of his glance, saw a girl's tall, slight flgmre emerg ins from behind a clump of mimosa bushes half-way up the oliff. 'Oh, I see\'97It's that daft lassie . again,' . . she said. , . ' ?', , . ,'?'?? 'Dogs she mean to climb down that cliff? Oh, it Is madncss-Hihe will kill herself!' Brian' cried. ' 'Not she, she's as sure-footed as a \'a9oat, Mr. Brian, an'i th' cliffs are not quite so steep as they look from,here,' Norah answered placidly. ' ? .'. Brian frowned and bit his- lip. He watched anxiously, his heart beat Ing with mingled admiration of the girl's courage and anger at her foolha-rdiness.'.as-she swung 'herself from ledg-e to ledge down the steep cliff. it seemed almost Impossible that she could reach .the bottom with out some slip, some- incautious step which would hurt her to her death on the jagged rocks below, or into the deep, sullen river which flowed silently at their foot. .He drew a deep breath of relief as at last she reached a more ' accessible pant of the cliff and sprang ?v, lightly from rock to rock. ?;' 'Who is she, Norah?' he asked curi \\ ously. . ? ? ' 'Deed, she's a' wild lassie, Mr. Bri an,' :Norah said with a 'little contempt ./?. in her voice. 'She's half a savage, her . coif, an' no wonder, livin' as she does wi* a father that's little better nor a 'natural,' poor .man, an' an auld ser\
vant !hat is .more llge a wl!tch nor a Christian woman.' ..'Look, look! She is going to swim across to us!' Brian cried. As he spoke the girl sprang lightly upon a great rock which jutted out in to the river, and, raising her hands above her head, jumped into tho water and swam across till she reached .the opposite bank. Then, standing on the stones, she paused for a moment to ; shake the water -'from her dress, and Brian saw tihafshe was taH and slight and very pre'tty;' that her dress con sisted of a pair of full sergekrilcker bockers, and long boots of undressed lea ther, which finished where the knicker bockers began. Brian was a great ad mirer of beauty, and he watched1 her with deyghted admiration 'as she ran up the bank and approached them. ' 'Deed, an' I don't deny she's .pretty enoug-h,' Norah answered drily, 'an' as for fear, she don't know, 'th' manln' o' ' th1 word, for no one but herself would dare to swim across th' river.' . 'Why not? Is the current strong enough to bo dangerous?' 'Brian asked. 'Th' sharks is, If th1 current isn't,' Norah answered with a significant nod. 'We're none so^far from th' sea here, Mr. Brian, an' some times, th' sharks come .up th1 river\'97 my man has seen more than one lately. Ye'll be doln' that once, too often,' -Miss CMnthy,' she added, rai-sln^ her yoice as the girl came nearer, 'an1 so I've told ye, agin and, agin afore this.' The pin gave a light laugh, .then flashed a quick glance from Mrs. Daly to'Brlan's interested face.. ? 'Ohj. y^bu mean because 'of. ''the sharks?' she said carelessly. ? 'They know me too well to hurt me, Mrs. Daly.'. -, 'Well, mark my wordV ye'.ll wish yo'd listened to m$, some day,' Mrs. Daly saldv. severely. '? ,v '? .... '-' Again the1 girl vlaughed, It was the sweetest, .most '.musical .laugh, Brian thought. /? ' ;' : :;,: ? ? 'If -I was. dodging a shark I .don't suppose: I ? -should have time to medi tate, either oh 'your words or anybody else's,' she'. answered lightly. 'You'd better mark .my words to-day, if you want' to' save your house and the cattle^ for, there's a grass-flro no.t sVyory far away, burning all before it-f '' 'A. grass-iflre!'f Both Brlan.and Mrs. Daly started and the woman's 'comeiy face turned' deadly white; sW wrung ner'- hands despair ingly. ?'?' ?:*;;;?;?? '?'????.'' \\' : ; ? : ? 'Aa'r.wiiafirj'do an' Tim away?' she mbunhri, looking helplessly from, one t'-tlu-., other. ''Are ye.' sure; Miss1' 'Quite sure. !I was up on the cliff arid saw it and came to warn. you. Don'.t be frightened, Mrs. Daly.'.', There was anote bf 'good-humored contempt In the girl's. voice,' as she: looked down, not unkindly,! at the other's frightened face. '.'It's, a long way off , yet, and 'we'll have all safe before it reaches us, never fear. Are .any/ of the Kaffirs about ?'. \'ab 'Oriiy Koma.tlc.v7 He was here just now.'' ?'! .-.??... ?'..'??' 'I'll booee for ;him,' . ? ,'??.. '- ? . 4 Miss. Cyrithla'|, shrill, call rang clear ?Q.n,a .'?jveet above': the rudh,of the river. It was; -answered by a 'deeper note close ^t hand, ami presently a: tall Kaffir 'came running along the bank, 'driving a flock of ? sheep before'' him. ?, ? :..r ' i'Ldok/sharp, Kpmatlc;' Miss Cynthia said sickly.1 ...'Get those, sheep into 'the kraal. ' VGrass-flre not^ery far off.' 'I .know, mlssle, ;I .'saw Lt,';, the Kaffir answered phiegmatlcally. Brian step ped forward arid raised his hat,' '.;.. 'fls .-tftiero: any danger?' he asked. ? ?_'Any danger?' ;Cynthla .flashed' ; .a quick, ' half-amusedi half-contemptur ous look from' her .big blue eyes. She was about1 to answer when her'giane'e happened to fall .on Mrs. Daly's terri fied face, and she checked, herself. 'Oh1, noi not at present.. Comej Mrs. Daly, wake up!' . She laid her hand on the ?frightened '.woman's ^shoulder with ' a kind bu,t , imperative gesture. 'You get, all' the buckets and pails In the house and fill them full of. water\'97 we'll do the .rest/' . ?'. .... , 'Let ; me', help! ' Brian, said ^ eagerly, and she gave hinv a quick look\'97a look which stung him\'97 which in some inde-! finable way conveyed the impression that she, did. not place any very \\ high value' on the services he offered, Then she nodded slightly. ., \'ab ' . 'Come tlien;' she ? said, and ran round the corner of the house,i followed oloaely by Brian. Her curt 'manner and disdainful glances half-amused and half- irritated Brian, who, was usually a favorite with women, and was accus tomed to receive a considerable amount of flattery and attention from' them. He determined to show this chit of a girl that ho 'was not the useless dandy ^she evidently thought him. 'Won't _ you ca.toh cold In your wet clothes?' he asked, as they ran side by side round the house. 'Had you nojt better go indoors and change them first?' ' The girl shook her head. 'Haven't .time now,' she said; 'be- sides, I never, catch cold.' ; 'You must be so uncomfortable, and a minute or so can't make much differ.! ence,' Brian urged. . ' 'A minute or two will make all the. difference in the \\yorld. It is ca-sy to1 see that you know nothing about grass flres,' Miss Cynthia retorted with more truth than politeness. 'That, is true. But I have often read about them and wished to see one,' Brian answered, 'Well, your wishes are In a fair way to bo realised, for I guess you'll see a pretty. big blaze presenty,' Cyn thia returned shortly. 'Have you any matches?' 'Yes, .plenty.' Brian produced a lit tle silver-box from his pocket and of fered it to her. She nodded. 'All right. We shall want them pre sently.'\
As she Ispoke they emerged from the bush Into tho open veld:, and she point. ed to a Hhlck cloud- of smoke which, driven by the wind, canic rolling across the yeldt.. ' 'Here it comes,' she said. ^'.'We have no' time to spare.'. . :..; .. The'flre was. still a long way off, but ' already' the hoat was 'almost insupport able,', the ??'all1' -quivered and danced with It, ' and ? the sun ^ho'ne j through ; the sinoko and; cast a blinding yellow' glare on all around,- and a dull, lurid light overspread the, sky. 'Every now and ?.then a tongife of lire would lea/p, up and fall again. ? ? Every moment the Bmoke gre\\y blacker and denser, and a curious terrifying j sound, the . roar of an ap proaching fire,, which onco, heard can never j'bo forgo'tteTi,' gre\\v louder and ?louder as the fire came nearer, ' ; There wass'ome.thin^ so terrible and yet so majestic and awe- inspiring in trie scene that Involuntarily .Brian ? stopped and. gazed at it. in wondering silence and admiration, ,A flock of sheop and a few, oxen that had strayed away upon; the' veldt camo .hying, past him, ' half,- mads wliWi terror! overhead the vultures. and hawks circled to and .fro, uttering -. wlW, hoarse screams; every moment the heat and glare grew more Intense,' the.rpar of tho lire the ?louder. . .Cynthia paused also and look ed eagerly across the veldt. 'The .winflds. rising, it Is no,t safe to go any^furthor. Give. mo tho matches!' Brian, rather puzzled, by tho abrupt ?request, obeyod-, and watched with groat surprise, as she hastily set fire to a xlump of long, dry grassland a thin line .of flame, fanned by tho wind, ran rapidly along. Me. turf. It seemed to him, In his ignorance of the means often ?adopted by the settlers to oheisk ^he bush 'fires, as if the action Increased In stead of diminished the danger. ? . ? 'What are you doing?' ho cried, anijl involuntarily he clutched at his comr panion's. arm. She gave him a sur prised lndlgnanit glance, and snatched her arm a\\s;ay. , ... .' 'Making .a clearance, to check. 'the fire of course,' sho. said in the .con temptuous ? tone which had irritated Brian., before. 'Our best chance 'is to fight fire with fire.' 'But isn't It a dangerous remedy?.' . Cynthia shrugged her shoulders. 'Oh, we can keep l.t under control If It gets too. near tho house,' she said, 'If we are lucky, by the time the. fire arrives 'there will be nothing left for it to feed upon. But wo must not linger here, or wo shall be between two fires,' she added, and she ran back .to tho house, followed quickly by Brian. Mrs. Daly, looking utterly bewildered and terrified, was standing on tho bank of the river, helping tlis Kaffir to fill all 'the available vessels with water, 'With these, as fast as they wore filled, Brlnn, assisted and directed by Cynthia, deluged tho grass Immediately about the house and the slcio of the Kraal nearest the firo; and then \'97 still under Cynthia's directions\'97 he lopped off some branches from tho trees, with which to beat oui the sparks which every now\
and then the wind scattered, around them. The flame which Cynthia had kindled was now rapidly approaching the house, but as the supply of water vhjb abun dant and close at hand, tibry rldd not experience much dlfflcu.tv in keeping it In check; and as tho roof -.*. -:l-he house was -made, as \\* vomraqn in Na-_ tal. of corrugated Iron, -).wre urn,s'no danger tov be ? feared when a shower of .??parka fell on It. .- Brian soon recognised the wisdom of the plan which, Cynthia had adopted to avert danger, for as the great cloud of flame and dense black . smoke swept across the scene it received a., sudden cheek* as It reached the bare,. scorched space which stretched between It and the house. There was nothing left but a few tufts of grass for the flame to feed on, and these, a's they were sat alight, were easily damped with . a bucket of water, The heat was, still Intense, and the atmosphere full ' of. blinding smoke; the baked ground al most burnt .their feet,- But . .the danger was past,., the -house ' arid cattle were safe, and the defenders, hot and tired and blackened with smoke,, looked thariu'fully^at each other as :the fire swept ? past them away to the east. ., _ ?; ,':-..?'',. .?,-.? Cynthia, relieved of her .anxiety, was how ln;a moor amiable mood, and she looked .at Brian with an'amused twinkle in her Wight eyes, He, : being keenly' 'all'ye to 'feminine charms, had already noticed how large and blue they, were, and how long and thick were the lashes -which .sheltered them. 'Well, how. do you Ilka your first eJir iperlence of bush-fires?' she. asked, '/'Brian'' laughed, and^ shrugged,',-his shoulders/ ... : .v - .

She- was, very pretty, He thought, 'arid dellghtfuliy 'frank and.; unsophisticated; so lie' looked ' and\
listened, while she, somewhat Imperi ously, and with the manner of one accustomed to being obeyed, put him through a searching .catechism re specting his'1 present plans, his home and 'people, and the object of his visit to Natal, and went on' to lay 'down the ' law on Various . subjects about which sho evidently , knew nothing. When he meekly suggested that it was just possible she might be mistaken she looked so superbly surprised that he should dare to question any state ment which shg was pleased to make, that it was with difficulty he could preserve a befitting gravity.- ? Cynthia, lndee*d, was as ignorant as a child of everything outside the nar row radius of her own little world, but Brian liked heivnone the worse for that. He had suffered many things during the voyage, from a Glrton young lady who w.as going out to the Cape as governess, and who had in sisted\'97even in the Tropics\'97 on dis cussing: abstruse subjects with him ; and the delightful sense of sexual su periority so dear to the masculine mind, -which had been crushed for a time by this objectionable young person, revived again In Brian's heart, as he listened to Cynthia's naive re marks and astounding statements.\
She : was so ignorant, and so delight fully/unconscious of it, and so charm ing' 'and pretty, that he felt it would be 'quite a pleasant task to act as her meqtor; \\and' was glad to remember that'.he had not returned a decisive refusal' to the) cordial invitation which Mrs. ;Daiy had g'iven him, to remain a. few days at the farm and make the acquaintance of the absent Tim. There was probably good fishing and shoot lnig'.to be had in *.ho neighborhood, and 'with these and^, the society of a pretty' girl, he could pass a week very pleasantly. It would be a new experi ence, 'Brian thought complacently. '.'Do 'you mean to say you have lived hei'A: ?'$ your life\'97 that you have never been to school, or had any com panions?' he asked presently when Mls3v;Cynthla's questions were ex hausted,, and. her curiosity Vas In some degree satisfied.
