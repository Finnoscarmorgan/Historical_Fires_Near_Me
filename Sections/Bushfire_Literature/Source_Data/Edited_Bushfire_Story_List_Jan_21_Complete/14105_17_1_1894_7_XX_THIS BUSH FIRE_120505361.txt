 (ILL lUQUTS HKSEEVED.) - ' ? CHAPTER XX, THE BUSH FIRE. 

 WHEN Ititty hoard tho truth about Donolly'R death .from JTarris'. story sho know what it meant to Nod. Sho thought it a . juBt l'olriuulion upon Wonully for his conduct, but the law would call it murdor, and Nod's lifo must bo tho forfeit for tlio crlnid. Tho moro Kitty thought over it in hor own room, tlio moro bowildorudslio becamu. 

 Sho : felt sho must do Boinotlunjr, but what? Sho could not romuin quiet at Murvaystono aftor this. , The bost plan would bo to Mole out Nod, and poratmdo him to save lumoulf. Suroly now his lifo wus iikdan-;or hu would no longer hesitate to leavti thu colony. When tho household woro at rost at Murrayatone, Kitty stole out as sho had done on u foruior becusion, and went to tho atiiblo and saddled Czarina, tho inn.ro that hud oari'iod hur on the hmt nocturnal expedition. ? | Kitty was undecided which wuy'to take. Sho hardly cared whither, the mare wont. All aim wanted was to bo lilono 'with hor trouble, to think ovbr what Nod had dono, and to proparo herself for tho worst. - Showas iu a half dazed state of mind, nnd Czarina walked quietly on with tho bridlo-roins hanging loosoly in Kitty's hands and falling down her nock. Czarina ' appeared to bo in somnwlmt tho siiuio stato of iniud us her mistress, for sho lmnsj her head, and her eyoa woro half closed imd blinked lazily. It was a' very hot night.' Thoro was hardly a broath of air. What littlo air faunod Kitty's faco felt hot ana sultry, liko a waft from tho opon oven. A nijjhtliko this has a pecular languid ofluct on pooplo. Aftor a rostloss uight tho sloepor wakes unrufroshed, and fuels us though ho had been passing a couple of hours iu a TurkiBh bath. Tho heat could almost ho felt. Every thing was warm to tho touch aa tho sun had 'left it when hu cauk to rest amidst a burning fimmco of clouds. AU day long tho parched laud had buen Bcorohed by his rays, and ho hud loft his mark bohind on naturoas sho restlessly slumbered. Tho hum of thousands of inaocts could bo hoard, and tho buzz of the mosquitoes sounded all arouud the mare's head. Czarina must havo walkod several miles boforo Kitty took any hoed oftho direction in which sho was going. At last slio roused horsolf and peered into tho darknoss, but could not dis tinguish anything to' guide hor aa to who.ro sho was. Until daybreak sho might as well wander on, it mattered littlo in which direc tion sho was^oing. How hot it was. Sho folt it moro and moro, and tho mare sniffed and seemed to Bcent dungor. Suddenly tho sky behind hor appeared to be lighted up, and cast shadows iu front of lior iintb. Sho was on a slight eminenco now, and reined in the mare and turned her head round. Far away in the roar Kitty could see an awful glare, which increased and gathorod iu volume with romarlrable rapidity. Tlio summit of tiio mountains in tho distance looked to bn on fire, and the landscape for miles arouud was covered in the same fiery glow. It was a bush firo, and spreading rapidly. There was nothing -to check itn devasta ting career. Kitty know tho land far and near was covered in long brushwood and dried, up grass that would bum Jiko tinder, and tho wind which' was rising behind' tho ilamds would fan thorn aud hurry them onward ut .a great pace. Thoro was no turning back in tho direction of Mnrraystono now. A hugo lino of firo lay between her end tho homo she had left. Kitty know sho would have to rido for hor life, and quickly. But although tho danger was incroas ing every minute, bIio could not forbear to look at tho magnificent sceno. Everything in front of her as far as sho could see, aud.oii all sides, was one mass of flames. 'J.'ho mountains Boomed to bo belching forth streaks of fire, and as tho flamos licked tho treos aud clung to thorn, twisting and twirling up tho trunks, and leaping from branch to branch, the effectiveness of the scono was considerably heightened. Then Kitty fancied sho could hoar a roll of distant thunder borne on tho night wind. It must be tho tramp of ilyiug horso3 and cuttle, and tho numerous animals that hauntvd the bush and plains. Thero was something to rouso Kitty from the lethargy she had fallon into in all this, and Czarina was also impatient to be going. Kitty gave the mate her head and rode on^a3 fast as sho daro.boing man unknown country, and no daylight at hand. As morning broko ' sho rodo fastqr, and she could now foel tho heat of tho enormous firo as it was blown towards her. Glancing back, sho saw the lino of firo which was driving overy living thing before it, and was gaining fast upon her. She know in which direction she had been going now. If sho could roach tho river in timo all would bo well, that would stop tho course of tho fire. Sho urged Czarina to hor utmost speed. It was eoveral milos before she could roach tho haven of safety she sought, - On wont Czarina. It waB woll tho maro had good blood in her voin3, and hor podi grtto could bo traced back for three or four generations to old stayers, tha garaost of tho game. Czarina would want all that great power nlio hud inhoritod now to Bavo hor lifo and tho life of her mistress. , ?. Tho maro know what was oxpoctcd of hor. ' With a-: long swooping low stride sho covorod tho ground at a regular, ovon pa co. Many a hard 'gallop had Czarina done, but this was tho most suvore task bIio had ovor been not. Milo after milo waa covorod, and still tho roar of tho terrible firo could bo hgai'd behind, and tho shrieks and cries of animals aa they woro caught ia tho devour ing flamo. On, Czarina, on I Courage, maro, courugo I Husband woll your groat strength and Save Kitty Caroy from an awful fato. lior sides heaved, and hor nostrils wore oxtoudod. Tho mnro'a breath ?ssmod to como in great gasps. 'Would oho faltor?' thought Kilty iu dIio felt tho noblo animal undur hor wan Btaining ovory nerve. Still Czarina kopt on her coursn. Hor wondorful powora of onduranco woro not taxod to thoir utmost yet. It wan a rogular rout. Horson wild with, terror, which lout spood to th�ir limb.), now flashed ])iiiit Kitty, in thoir mad choso. Thoir manps woro flowing in tho wind, their oyes were dilated with fear, and their sides rooked with sweat and foam. Somo of them dashed past hor i.o cIobo that she could h*�' touched them. Thoy took no 

 hood of hor, nor of Czarina, now toiling on with her burden at a bIowoi1 pace. A muro with a foal at foot that startod oil in front of Kitty stoppod and houitatod when she saw hor young ono could not follow so quick. Kitty saw hor, and hor heart almost blod for the poor uiothor as aho saw tho look of anguish in hor e-yos. Iu front of hor Kitty saw a thin whito streak. It was the rivor. Thank God, it was tho river. The maro stood still and looked at her foal. Sho licked it, pubhod it with hor uoso aud urgud it gently forward. Tho young ouo, uuawnro of tho danger, bub terrified at. the galloping crowd, of wild, liaK demented animals around, scumud uuablo to move. Kitty galloped clo3o up to them with Czhriim, mid tlio sight of a hitiuiin boiug Buoniud to givu tho foal courage. The young ono gallopod as fast as its limbs would permit it by its dam's Bido, aud joined in Iho mad nice. . ^ As Kitty looked bohind she saw the mother and foal toiling on., The. maro would not loavo hor young ouo ; -would nob dosurt it tho hour ot danger. Kitty hoped they w,ould' reach the rivor before the ilames got up. Tho wind: had gone down a littlo, and tho firo did not travol so rapidly, but still it camo on at a great rato. Kitty could now plainly see the rivor in frontwith a crowd of animals on tho brink, afraid to tako' to tho water to Bave them trom tho fire. Czarina saw tho water ahead, and struggled gamely on. Shu would not hosi tuto to pluugo iu onco she reached tho brink. She had bwuiu it many timus without such urgout need. Tho maro dashod through tho crowd of frightened aniinals, and Kitty urgod hor to tako to tho water. Czarina wont in. Tho rivor was fairly wide at this part, and tho current strong, bub as thoro had been no rain for Donio timo the banks woro nob so full as they other wise would havo been. In' tho middle of tho river it was doop, and tho water whirled and oddyed.' Czarina battlod with it, but hot* strength was wull nigh exhausted, and Kitty could hear hor breath como iu groat Boba. For a few'; moments tho maro ceased swimming, and wont dowu with the curront, but Kibty urgod hor on, and sho made auother game effort. Luckily tho crinrent had .taken them near tho bunk, and this lasb oifort on tho pare of Czarina brought thorn to tho -sido. It was somewhat steep, but Kitty saw that the maro had obtained foothold. She got off into tho water and ^wadod ashoro, thon aho tuggod ' 'ot the bridle, and Czarina managed to scramble up the bank. The mnro had no sooner x-eaehod* tho firm ground than one snuk doirnoxhaustod, and lay gasping for breath. Tears stood in Kitty's oyos as sho looked at the gallant animal that had saved her lifo. Czarina's lustrous eyoa seemed to look into Kitty's beseechingly The niarii/ cried to raise hor head, bub it fell to tho ground again, and bIio lay gaspiug iu.a piteous way. Kitty took tho maro's bond iu hoi: lap, and cried like a child. She loved Czarina as only a bush bred --;irl knows how to lovo tho animal that is Aer faithful, constant companion. Sho stroked tho 'maro'a hoad, and Czarina looked' up into hor faco. Then Kitty saw a faint rod streal; trickling' down tho maro's nostrilp. She must havo broken a blood-vessel./.' Tho strain, upon her had boon too groat. Kitty wipo'd it with her Buddlo-clotli, aud watched anxiously to boo if thci blood flowed freely. No ; thero was a chance yet. Czarina might not havo injured horsolif, seriously. Porhaps it wa3 tho exertion in gtisping for hre:itli had cniiood tho blood to fiuiv. The maro was not bo abort winded flow. Kitty laid hor hoad down on tho ground, and eat by hor side. As oho looked across tlio wi'do rivor, she naw the lire had almost burnt itself out, as the grass was but vory short for some distance boforo the wator was reached. Scores of animals had, however, at lasb plmigud in, and woro Rwiuxming across, or Uoutiug down with tho cui'rent. She saw tho maro with lior foal had reached the bank. Kitty watched what would happen to them. The maro suddenly pushed the foal iuto tho river, and followed. , Tho young one instinctively battled for his life,- but iu th� cmitro of tho stream the cut-rout. waii too strong for him. As tho foal glided down the rivor tho mothor gavo au almost human cry of agony. Sho Bivam aftor it iva fast as she could, and 'gained upon it. 'J.'hou sho reached out and caught its toil with her toeth, and steered for tho shore. Kitty was thankful to seo thoy reached tho laud safely, although both lay down oxhuusled. Czarinawas evidently recover ing, but could not yob regain hur feofc. Kitty saw thoro was no help for it but to slay thoro for the remainder of the day. Towards night Czarina recovered, and Kitty lodher goutty on, to seo if they could not find somo outlying station hut where thoy could g�t rust and food. Afteraeouplo of miles' tramp Kitty camo to a log hut. She saw a man sitting out side, and fancying ho was alone, slio did not liko to seok his aid. Then bIio hoard a child'u voico, and in a minute or two saw a woman come out of tho hut. Then without hesitation sho wont forward aud claimed their, hospitality, which -was readily granted. Tho inau .attended to Czarina's wants, whilo his wife, looted after Kitty's. Kilty related tho account of tho raco T/ith tho bush firo, and the boundary rider and his wifo woro glad of hor escape. Thoy wero hospitablo peoplo, and took a groat fancy to Kitty. They mado her as comtortablo as poaoiblo for tho night, and sho was sadly iu need of rest aftor tho oxcitouient of tho last night and day. While Kitty, thoroughly worn out and exhausted, slept in the boundary rider's hut, it may bo as well to soe what took placo at ALurraystono during tha bush lire. Kitty's absence cunsod consternation, moro especially whon Harris related how nho had overboard his uto'ry of Nad's and Donolly's duel. Maurice wont in Bcarch of hor, but ho had to roturn, for tho bush flro waa raging all round, and it would take them all tbair lima to save tho homestead. Manrico waa in a torriblo state of mind na to what had bocoino of Kitty. Would slii* escape tho fire t That waa bis constant thought. But in the oxcitemont of fighting tho flames nnd keeping thorn from reaching Murraystono, ho hud vory littlo time to think of anything else. All bands woro hard at it, including tho constables and Inspector Full'. Yard by yard thoy disputed th� ground witli the llamos. Thoy were soorohod and 

 burned, bub Uioy fought with tho conrago. of dosporaliun. They torn up tho Ion/;; graas, and bout at tho flames with bugv., ?ticks, aud all kind3 of articles that, can vo haudy. Fighting a bush firo is an oxporioucei a man does not want more thau once iu a l'lfo timo. Happily, the moro fiorco part of tho firo did nob roach the Alurraystono station,, but diverged to tho right, in the diroutlon Kitty had gone, towards tho river. Thoy fought nil day with tho fl.nmos, whiah Woro strong enough to juako )� vary dangerous for tho homestead, but boforo nightfall sucuuedud in gutting' thorn undor. A douse, mass of uuioko hung ower tlio wholo country-side, nnd tho burniu. p- smell wufl unplous/iiifc, nnd had a choiring sen sation with it. Everything waa grimy and black look lug,' aud thu homestead ' fa r all tho world might havo been deiugod, in a soot uliowor. ? - Tho paddocks and ntoek-ynrds wero crowded with horscsf cattle, and Esheop that had buou driven thoro by. tlio ilamos. ? Whoro had Kitty got to? was tho question that pvoseutud itself, to each ono iu turn. Tho firo must havo oxtoni'ied for many milea, and if sho hud taken li.or way towards the Careys' cottugo sho niuet havo hud* a hard rido for her lifo. It wns a limo of anxiety to Maurice, who refused to, bo .comforted lay his unclo's as surance that no bush firo that ever ritgod could catch Czarina if sin; got along start, as sho must have doup iu, this case. Maurico dotormined that next day ho woiiid resume his soarc'Vi for Kitty, and In spector JTu.ll: siiggestijd tlmt us ho was going to commence- smuring tbo country with-his troopers in sijiareh of tho Careys, he might accompany them. To this Matfftao agreed. (To iie Continued.)
