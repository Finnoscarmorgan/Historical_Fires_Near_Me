 TEE BRONZE CHALICE. AN AUSTRALIAN TALE. 

 CHAPTER I. CHIAE0-08CUB0�SOOZAJi AND MORAL. 

 BT J. 6. VOOBE. 

 Thb months of January and February, in the year of Redemption one thousand eight hundred and one, are still keenly remembered by the few survivors* of those who, in that shadowy period of Australian history, formed the little settlement on the shores of Port Jackson. Sydney should, at that period, be called the city of the Salamander, So intense had been the heat during the day, that work, even of a light character, was, if not absolutely intolerable, extremely painful. Even the convict gangs, engaged in roadmaking, had two hours extra repose allowed " them during the most horrid "torrid" hours of the day. An angry flush, with a deep tone of crimson in it, spreading over the north-west at eventide, an oppressive thickness in the air all night, and still more oppressive after daybreak, a painful dazzling wkiteneu in the sunlight during the first hours of morning, were the infallible signs, or frequent forerunners, of the continuanoe of a scorohing season. Far away in the dense brown bush, too, a greyish oloud of Smoke�its under rim slightly tipped with orange�might, day after day, be seen hanging sluggishly in the oppressive atmosphere. There was nothing cool�nothing fresh�nothing soothing�about the little settlement and its surrounding scenery� save when one of the weary inhabitants could catch a glimpse of the blue waters of the harbour, ever lying soft and beautiful as liquid glass or polished steel, and still giving delicious refreshment to men with burning brows and heavy hearts. The month of March was little better than its predecessors ; the god of fire seemed determined to extend his reign into at least one-half the months of the year. Not alone in the physical, but in the moral world, was the condition of the poor little colony calculated to evoke melancholy feelings. It was the period of the lagh�of chains�of prisons- of slow starvation�and of tyrants with hearts as full of unholy passions as hell. Sketches of a later time, driven into his splendid narrative in Rembrandt colours, by the Right Rev. Bishop Ullathorne, were paradisaic days in comparison with that disastrous epooh. None suffered more, during the oppressive era, than the Irish Catholic prisoners. Although not condemned�in general�for any violation of the law of God, but simply for a bold effort to give freedom�mind, freedom, o eomciettee, as well as political enfranchisement �to their native land, they were treated worse than the most depraved felons in the country. _ Governor Hunter was a Scotch Presbyterian, of strong views, and an anti- Catholio bigot of the dirtiest water. A well authenticated anecdote, illustrative of his character, is Jpretty popularly known. Dr. Lang, who seldom uses his daubing brush on Scottish worthies, thus relates it: " Governor Hunter was a Scotchman and a Presbyterian, and the only saint he seems to have recognised was his late chief, Governor Phillip, in honour of whom�and not of his namesake the apostle�he named the Church (the first plfwe of worship erected in the colony) ' St Phillip's Church.' Such was the primary aspeot of apostolical sucoeBsion in New South Wales !" His hatred of Catholicity and Catholios was extreme. "With these remarks we proceed with our veracious history. The scene opens towards the end of March, in the year indicated. One of the first houses in the colony, possess - ing any pretension to beauty, was the dwelling erected by a private gentleman, Captain Dormer Lake, a retired officer. It stood on an admirable site. One of the loveliest inlets of Port Jaokson, F Bay, lay blue and fresh before it. Tall eucalypti, dense masses of the native tea-tree, gigantic creepers, �With here and there a patoh of monster fern, OT a clump of spear-grass, protected it on three sides. The tenement itself was for the tnost part of wood�the valuable properties of the iron-bark having been already tested and appreciated. An elegant facade, in the Greco-Italian style of architecture� a line of light, graceful pillars�a row of tall windows �and' a flat roof, relieved, however, by a ledge.of delicate coping, will give the reader some idea of this tasteful villa. A patoh of garden cultivated obviously with the greatest possible care, stretched down to the water's edge. The place was isolated and solitary enough, but prevented from being absolutely desolate by the occasional whirr of a flock of green-coated, red-crested parrots, or the rapid movements of the young kangaroos, in w the neighbouring bush. b -On on evening towards the �nd of March, o m the year already mentioned, and at the tn little' villa just described, two very opposite characters stood under a shelving rock not t more than a gtohe'a throw from the front b floor.

 tinn. One was an old woman some sixty years of age. Her features were thin, angular, but not repulsive; her skin tanned a dark brown; her hair an iron grey. She had a large, cold, blue eye, and seemed to be a person possessed of great energy, if not of strong deoision of character. She was dressed in an old brown silk bonnet, common cotton frock, with a scarlet shawl wrapped round her shoulders. Her companion seemed to belong to a different raoe�to a different order of beings. She was a young girl, of apparently sixteenyears, and of jrare, delicate beauty. This beauty did not lie alone in her exquisite pink-and-white complexion, in the refined style of her features, in the wealth of golden-brown hair that danced in a hundred shining ringlets (curled by nature, not by art) on her fine symmetrical- shoulders, or played round her curved neck; but it seemed to emanate from her small mouth, from those lips, soft and rich in colour as wet red ooral; it came as a divine presence out of her dark blue eye, and glorified every feature of her face�every tone of her voice�every attitude she fell into. There was something apparently fragile about this oreature, too� perhaps partly arising from the white muslin gown in which she was arrayed, and which tended considerably to spiritualise her appearance. As she listened attentively, and obviously with great delight, to the news the old crone, her companion, was communicating, she stroked with her soft, tiny, and flexible white hand the scarlet and green velvety neck and baok of a splendid kingparrot, that bore on his wings the armorial bearings of his royal raoe�those flecks of white with saffron shade in them, which vulgar ornithologists call his butterfliei. The young lady possessor of the bird was far too attentive to the discourse of her old companion, to be conscious of various amorous movements, as well as occasional jealous reaks, made or given by the gorgeouslylumaged creature in her hand. 

 A portion of their conversation will best give an idea of its interesting nature. " "Well, and then, my darling young lady," continued the old woman, in a strong Munster accent, "after all that passed, I longed to see and speak to you. The day, you know, was fearfully hot, and it was made hotter up there by the bush fires. Oh, if you only saw the sight I witnessed yesterday: the cattle lying, some dying, others dead; some rotting, others rotten, on the oart tracks ; the very birds dropping down dead from the trees, and the trees themselves scorched browner than my old arm, and ready to take fire at the first spark. A drop of water could not be got for love or money. Soil and sand burned under my feet. Oh it was a fearful day, my colleen darling; but persevered. I knew how your young heart felt, and, even in dreams at night, I fancied I stood between you and the glory of heaven, if I did not finish the work so well begun. I have sins, black and red, to answer f for, so I need not complain of a few foot blisters or a parched throat when working for the love of God � may He have pity on me ! I had my own share of trouble to get to Bee Father ; you know whom I mean; but at last we met. I have, my bright young lady, been hard-hearted and passionate in my days, and few things ever touched even the outer coat of my heart. I believe I have never cried but twice in my life ; once when my mother died, but I was too young to feel it much then; and the second time when I had vengeance�ay, terrible, horrible, hellish vengeance�on the man who deceived me�the man who made me the firet dishonour to my name and race. I am one of the Red O'Gormans, and we have been proud in our way. Well, as I was saying, my heart is hard and cold; but when I heard that venerable man speak yesterday�when I remember all he has suffered inpatience and hope: he, a priest of Almighty God, the anointed of the Lord�pure; and good, and oly�working in a oonviot dress, with the mark of the felon on bis back, softened me ore than I can tell you. I felt that I could weep�I wept inwardly�but I had courasre o give him your message: to tell him that the Lord had enabled you to understand His holy will clearly, and that you were dying with the desire to be baptized. Poor man, he tears of joy flowed from his mild eyes. e took this small silver cross from a secret ole in his clothes�begged ine to hand it to ou�said _ it was given to him by an only ister of his, a holy nun, who died some years pfore the troubles began in the old oountry. e also gave me a great secret to oommusiate to you. Will you hear it now?" " Oh Nancy," said the young lady, in a oice deliriously sweet, tremulous, and empasioned, " tell me at onoe. When I receive dvice from him, I feel every doubt�every hadow�flit away from my soul. What did e tell youP Tell me at once, dearest ancy." " He intends, with God's help, on Sunday eek, which will be Easter Sunday, to celerate the Holy Sacrifice of the Maes in a sort f cave, near Mangrove Creek. He expects hat you will try to he there.

 girl blushed, veiled her eyes with their longfringed lids, and patted her bird more nervously than affectionately. Well, how are we to manage it, Nancy ? My uncle, the captain, is as bitter as ever, I am sure, against the Catholics. If he knew " " He must not know," spoken somewhat sternly, was the quick reply. "King Nulli- Nulli, the big black-fellow, Who can be trusted when he works for you, will be at the jettypoint down there, near the water-lilies, with his canoe, to meet you on Easter Sunday morning. He will paddle you across the basin, keeping within the shadows thrown on the water by the gum trees. When you get to. the other side, a person I know and myself will meet you ; so put your trust in God, and God alone, my dear, dear girl. Thanks to the Father of Mercies that I have not waited on you in vain. I will now, a-lhannah, bid you good-night; and may the bright angels of heaven guard your bed this blessed night, and the grace of God descend upon your young -soul. I never thought I could again love huntan being as I love you;" and the old woman's hitherto hard face expanded, under the influence of the gentle emotions that agitated her. A slight hectio threw for a moment a refined irradiation over her worn features; two dazzling tears stood in her large eyes, no longer stern and oold ; and the heaving of her breast shewed she was deeply moved. She took the young lady's small white hand into her own hardened and embrowned one, and reverently kissed it. The fair girl was deeply affected, and asked earnestly�"Is there anything, dear Nancy, I oan do for you?" "No; except, indeed, you get this week as many coppers as you can, and bits of brass. A couple of pounds weight will do. It is for young Kinsale I want them, who is making something particular, God bless him!" " What can he be making, Nancy ? Coppers and bits of brasB ! Do tell me all." 

 "That's the grand seoret�the secret of the Chalice; you know it now, and I needn't tell you not to breathe it to mortal, even in your _ dreams. In one place the church is clad in silk and purple, and uses vessels of gold, covered with precious stones: in another she wears ragB and oan do without the world's wealth. She is the spouse of the Son of God alike in both, my darling lady," andthe poor old creature became again for an instant tall, erect, and handsome, under the influence of the strong and elevating emotions that thrilled her. "So, Nancy, the copper and brass "is to make the Chalice. Well, come at this hour to-morrow evening, and I will see what I can do for you. Good night, again, Nancy;" and the sweet girl affectionately and unaffectedly extended her hand to her old friend. " Good night, Miss Jessie Lake, and God bless you. Neither the Captain, nor the Sootch Governor, nor any of his pack, oan keep you from Godand with these words, pronounced somewhat bitterly, she swept round an angle of the rock, plunged into the dense masses of forest scrub that stretched away on the south side of the villa, and was lost to sight. The young lady, after glancing for a moment over the splendid panorama� the distant groups of low houses, the then Sydney, brought out sharp and distinct in the white moonlight; the great brown forest, one mass of dun shadow; the softly illumined waters; the undulating sweep of the landscape ;�oould not help breathing a prayer, that the Heavenly Father would not in His great mercy be unmindful of a scene so fair; but would, in good time, send a purer and diviner light over, the faoe of the land, and enrich it with a more abiding glory. Who shall say that He did not hearken to the prayer of one so young, pure, and bright? 

 CHAPTER IL ZINC} KULLI-JTOLUC AND THB NEOPHYTE. . His Royal Highness Nulli-Nulli, sovereign lord of Woolloomooloo, its kangaroos, bees' nests, parrots, parroquets, lizards, snakes, and fisheries,was,, at the time of our story, reduced, like many a kingly majesty of prouder race and higher pretensions, to a very degraded position. He who ere while was- now compelled to hide away in. the scrub and fern of the marfihes uong the Parramatta River, or drop now and then into the " white gnnyah " of Captain 'Lake, as he called the villa. The residence of thb gentleman had a peculiar >ec attraction for his sable majesty. He there beheld the first presence that over-awed his savage nature� the first being that ever-awoke ahigh sentiment in his breast. He looked upon her, to use his own figurativelanguage, as one made out of the substance of a star and robed in the foam of the sea. The most undoubted reverence towards her swayeid all his movements, and 'sanctified his- savage -feelings.

He saved her once from drah by drowning-, and nearly lost his own life'on the onr.flsion, through his efforts to g it her cape -which lay floatiug on the water, not far from the frislcing-ground of a lanre sharlr. He was accomplished in all the higher branches of a princely blackfellow's. education. � No one in his own dominions'�nor, it 'was asserted, in the contiguous kingdoms of Botany and the remote Bulli�could make a boomerang perform such extraordinary gyraiions � in the air, or so easily level a hostile gntiyah with a single blow of his waddj-. Iu the celebrated battle of Big Ooogee, in which he marched at the head of thirty-one warriors and a military band of twenry-five gins (with several papooses), he defeated Prince Moomoo Mo'omoo, the commander of a much larger host, laid two warriors tind a gin dead on the field of battle�hurled one of Moomoo Moomoo's maternal uncles over the rocks into a small ravine on the left win-/ of the enemy, thereby oausing fracture of the right arm and several severe scratches on the face�and, in a word, carried off two womon and various instruments of war�a green-stone hatohet, and a monster nulli-nuUi included�and several bark bago. with one fine imperial 'possum cloak. The achievements of this memorable day were often recounted to the "white men that came out of the sea" by the conquering hero himself, who, unlike many who have made or <rot great names in story, used always to -wind up his narrative by showing�with as much pride as an old Roman�some honourable tears�his trophy from the field of Co >gee. To this " princely gentleman" Miss Lake communicated her wish to be paddled across the bay on the day fixed. At first he received her commands in his ordinary style of stolid obedience; suddenly he began dancing about her, and salaaming at a moat frantic rate. A new thought seemed to strike him, and raising himself up with considerable dignity, a flash of joy illuming his quick, large eyes, he earnestly asked her: " Will thfi queen of the white gins never come back more to biof gunvah?" As he spoke he pointed to Captain Lake's new house. " Oh, yes," she answered, carelessly; " sometimes during the day; but you won't have to wait; you shall leave me at the rooks above Mangrove Bay, and then you can return home. I shall find another way. Perhaps I shall not return here, but pay a visit to my friends over in the city." " Do�do�bird�good lady�pinirfng gin," and with this eulogistic climax Nulli-Nulli took his departure. Without tiring the reader with any mora of his royal highness's conversation, or recording the various gambols he played, after he had reaohed a dignified distance from the soene of his interview with Miss Lake, we at once proceed to the grand event �f this wellattested tradition�a tradition which, if circumstances enabled us to develops it in accordance with the reoognised rules of Art, we could not only expand it, but establish its main facts, by quoting from the publio records of the oountry.
