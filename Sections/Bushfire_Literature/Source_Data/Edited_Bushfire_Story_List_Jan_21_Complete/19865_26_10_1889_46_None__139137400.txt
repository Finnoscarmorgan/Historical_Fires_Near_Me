THE STORYTELLER. 

 ONE N20HT AT GORBINGE. 

 Bi A. M. 

 Charlie Mackenzie came walking up from the woolshed to the house, one warm morning in last November. lie bore about him an ait at great importance, and frequently referring to an open pocket-book in his hand, alternately made notes therein and talked in a voluble and dictatorial manner to big Dugald Cameron, the overseer, who was 

 with him. 

 Charlie's Bister observed them from the open doorway, and rave a little laugh as she noted the droll sidelong look with which Dogald listened to Charlie's eon vernation, 

 ana she said half aloud, ** Well! isn't that J boy patting on airs r 1 

 " The boy " came in presently, and dropped into his chair at the breakfast table. 

 " Oh, by the way, Bessie," he said, "you'll have to go to town without me. Dngald expects some trouble with those union fellows, and says I'll have to stop here." 

 " Then I shan't go," she declared. 

 " Oh, yes, yon WO!, old girl," said Charlie, much flattered at being so Bought after on both Bides. " Stay at the Trigs'; yon know they are for ever asking yon, and I'll give yon a sor. to lay on Ensign. Wonder what will win the Cap, though? It's bard lock for me, for I've wanted awfully to see it ran.*' 

 H Ob, Charlie, what is the me of listening to Dngald. as If he cared whether yon stayed or not? You onght to he ashamed of your self, Dngald, when yon know quite well that f won t go to town without him." 

 ' Dugald bad taken no part in the converse, 

 tion. "Well," said he, "it's my humble opinion that I might poll through without Master Charlie, bat as he suggested himself it { 

 would be better to have 'the boss' on the spot, as the men might take advantage of me, I just agreed.to what be said." And then Dugald winked at Charlie's sister, with an air of appreciation at bis own joke. , 

 "Ob, Dugald's too soft with the men,"said Charlie, who had not seen the wiuk, and felt indulgently towards his ally; " but for all that I've learnt a wrinkle or two from the Bame old boy." 

 " To go or not to go," that was the ques tion she set herself to think. She had really wanted Charlie to go for bis own sake, and, of course, she depended upon him to take her everywhere. They had arranged to stay at Menzies' and have a splendid time, and now the idea of staying with those slow going Trigs! But, on the other hand, there 

 was her Cop dress, fresh from the hands of: Madame, and which she was dying to wear. And, as a kind of secondary consideration, there was Jack Armstrong. Some few months before her betrothed, one Doctor Armstrong, had given her the diamond ring she wore, and somehow this latest thought of hers seemed to decide the matter. 

 When "Cup week" falls at shearing-time there is a struggle in the squatter's mind as to which comeB foremost, and, as a rule, he managea to snatch a day or two for the great event of the year. 

 Old Mackenzie bad bought this Victorian station for his son simply because he did not know what else to do with that good natured but not over-wiae youth. Leaving him under the charge of his old overseer, who managed Charlie cannily, he spent most of his time on hiB New South Wales stations, 

 occasionally pouncing down upon tuem at Gorriuge at tbe most unexpected times, just to see bow they were getting on. 

 So, when Dugald explained that Mr. Mac kenzie might make one of these invasions and not be orer-pleased to find Charlie away from his post, Bessie, being a sensible girl, agreed with him. He had already placed the suggestion before Charlie in a more diplo matic light 

 " Kemember, Mrs. Betts," said Bessie, on the eve of her departure, " you will attend to your master's meals while 1 am absent; and you are not to put him off with cold meat, or anything that may save yon trouble." 

 | Mrs. Betta was really tbe best of a long 

 list of domestic failures, and bad 6ome culi nary ability, though she was not dependable 

 It was gay in Melbourne last November, 

 Trim 

 and tbe Trigs proving more sociable than I 

 Bessie had anticipated, 6he bad not at all a bad time. Charlie was not forgotten. Be duly received a society paper containing a paragraph marked with ink describing "pretty Mies Mackenzie's charming gown worn on Cap Day." 

 Dr. Armstrong's profession did not allow him so mnch as he wonld have wished of his sweetheart's company. Bat one night he took her to " The Mikado," at " the Princess." It happened that she had seen it before, thongb neither he nor Mrs. Trig had, and while they were both taking a lively interest in the stage, ehe eat and reflected, and her thoughts 

 carried her far away to Gorringe. 1 

 " What is the matter?" Jack asked, noticing with surprise the sad look upou 

 his beloved's face. 

 " I'm thinking of Charlie," said she, de jectedly. " Poor boy ; I wonder what he's having for sapper to-night I've qaite made ap my mind, Jack, to go home to-morrow." 

 " Now, may yoa be forgiven !" said Jack. " Did I take yon here to think of each an in congrooas subject as Charlie's victuals ?" 

 Next morning Bessie left Spencer-street by the early train, and somewhere about 4 p.m. arrived at the wayside station. " No one to meet me," she repeated, in dismay, after the 

 1 stationmaster. " Is it possible that Charlie has not received my telegram ?" ; 

 " They have not sent (or their mail for these two days," said Mr. Brown. "On account of the bush fires the men have all been kept busy." And going into the little office, he reappeared with a large pile of letters and papers and Bessie's telegram to Charlie, which Jack had sent for her that morning. 

 " I'll tell yon what," said the station maBter sympathetically, " there's Tom, from Macphereona, come with the cart for those [ floor-bags, aim he could leave a message at 1 Carriage as he passes." 

 "Oh, couldnt 1 go in the cart?" asked Bessie, imploringly ; and when " Tom from Macpheraon's " permission had been soli cited he replied aorlily enough, " Kin if yer likes." Bessie, nothing daunted, clambered up and seated herselt on the enda ot the flour-bags. 

 Eight miles to Gorringe. What a drive it was! They jolted off straight in the face of the angry sun. Blackened stretches of coun try lay on each Bide of their road, and all that was left of the boundary fence between Gorringe and Woodlands were a few blackened posts, with the wire helplessly dangling or lying flat A thick smoke shrouded everything within a hundred yards. 

 At last they arrived at the hone paddock gate, and Bessie intimated to Tom that she would walk the quarter of a mile up to the house. She came in so quietly that no one noticed her, not even the doge, and sbe was so thoroughly exhausted after her drive and walk in the scorching heat that 8he threw herself down on the sittingroom sofa, and lay there resting lor ten minutes or sa 

 " What a surprise she would give Mrs. Bette if she came in just now, and Charlie and Dngald wben they came home in die evening." Bessie was fond of giving snrprieea 

 After drinking a glass of not very cold water from the sideboard she peeped cau tiously into Charlie's room, which opened off the BvttVugroom, as though expeciiuR to find him there; but the room was empty and in a most disordered state, actually : And her 

 wrath rose. The bed had not been made. 1 "1 must go and see Mrs. Bet to." she arid, j and on ha way out to die kitchen the thought | struck her that the plane seemed wonderfully 

 SLniet and deserted; bnt it was natural to 

 eel it so coming that morning from the noise 

 and bustle of the big city. 

 The kitchen, an old wooden structure,! detached from the house, was without an occupant. The door of the servants' room was wide open, but here again was emptiness. 

 " Mrs. Bette! Mrs. Bets r the girl called impatiently, and then, reoeiving no answer, she ran inside and opened every door in the boose, and not in one roopi did she find a living object. *' Good HeavenB r she said, in a frightened voice, and flew over the garden, down to the swamp at the foot, op to the poultry-yard�only some hungry-looking hens there�down to the haystack and stables�not 

 a horse. 

 " Where can they beH she thoughtln be-, wilderment, and then came back and made another fruitless search over the house, end ing in the kitchen. Bscs she saw what had escaped her notice before, that on the table was a heap of unwashed dishes, apparently from breakfast There was a long form lying on the floor, feet uppermost The fire was dead out and on the whitewashed hearth bar eve fell on it now�was a pool of blood. 

 "Oh God!" she said, and her heart stood I 

 still , . 

 "Those anion shearers! Had Charlie in his boyish presumption been too bold with them ?" She pressed her hands hard against her head. If she let her imagination run riot 

 she would go mad. 

 The garden at Gorringe slopes down to a neat rush-grown swamp hannted by water fowl, which every night send forth weird cries from their green beds. Here Bessie came to try and tbink in a dared kind of way. "The silence of that great Bwamp !" Not the smallest wind came to stir the dall waters or move the drooping leaves. 

 An aged terrier, half-blind and totally deaf, had crawled after her,and lay at her feet. All was intensely calm, noiseless, and solitary. The atmosphere was heavy and hot. Almost she seemea to be in another world. 

 Anyone who has tried it can testity that it is a more than Bolemn thing to be alone in the Australian bush ; but here, the deserted bouse that should have been filled with life, and the terrible uncertainty, the blood stains on the hearth�all this was enough to tax the heart and brain of any one, let 

 alone a helpless, inexperienced girl. j 

 The night was closing in, and through the j darkness and smoke came two men with swags upon their backs. She heard their footsteps as they stumbled round the kitchen, 

 and knew instinctively that they were j 

 strangers. 

 Then some unseen agency seemed to move her to a line of action. She roused the dog and made him follow her, and came to where the men were�not pleasant-looking men. To neither could she tell her distress, there fore. She must take pains to keep them in ignorance of it. , 

 "Was the boss at home? one asked�a j bold, disagreeable-looking man. 

 " Not yet, bnt ehe expected him shortly^ in the meantime they might stay in the hut." 

 " Thank ye, miss," said the same mai�� civilly; " but my mate and I'd be glad of a bit of tucker. We've come a long tramp to-day. 

 The mate, a red-bearded slouching man, chewed a bit of tobacco and said nothing. " I will a6k the cook," Bessie said, so strung up by this time that she was ready for any thing, even entering that awful kitchen again. She knew where the matches were kept, and lighted a candle, then got some bread, tea, and 6ngar, and took some time looking for meat, but could not find any. When she turned ronnd the man was looking curiously in. 

 " I suppose your cook will let me boil my billy here," said the man, looking sus piciously into the empty fire-place. 

 ."No," ehe answered, boldly, "yon can j light a fire in the hut" 

 He mattered something about " having no matches," and ehe gave him a box. I 

 When they had gone her conrage fled, and ; too weak to stand, she sank npon the floor, 

 almost fainting. Sad tears rained down her j white face, and presently she commenced to I weep passionately. Her overchangei heart seemed calmer after this outburst. Once more she must put on the etrain, and try to 

 live through this awfnl eight j 

 She took the candle and went inside. The taint light could not penetrate the gloom of the long dark room, and she cast fnrtive glances into ttie Bhadowed corners. Her workbasket Bhe noticed was in its accustomed place, and taking from it a handle of Charlie's socks, which had been placed there for mend ing, she sat down by the table, and took a long, long time threading her needle. 

 Had anyone looked through the window ? The blinds were down. They would have seen a girl calmly engaged in darning, and because the light was feeble tbey would not notice bow white was her face, or how peculiarly rigid her movements, as she laboriously drew ber needle in and out, or how cautiously she would lay the scissors on the table, as though she dared not break the silence. The silence was so profound that the ticking of the clock sonnded like the stroke ot a heavy hammer. That sudden cracking noise which is only noticed in the stiliiness of nigbt time woald set ber heart beating and nerves tingling. 

 Loudly the clock Btrnck ten. Almost simultaneously there was a step in the veran dah. Her heart gave a great jump, could it be Charlie ? Then a knock at the door dis pelled the hope, leaving her sick with disap pointment and feat. For some aeconds terror chained her to her seat, and it seemed im possible that Bhe could ever find courage to open the door. 

 She rose slowly and painfully ; like one lettered with heavy chains she walked. Standing at the door was the same man who had spoken to her before. 

 " My mate's taken bad with cramps, miss ; and if yon'll be so good as to give me a drop of brandy, I'd be obliged." 

 The man's tone was civil, but he looked cunningly at her. 

 " I will see if there is any," she answered, in a voice that to her ears sonnded miles away. In the cupboard she found halt a bottle of brandy, aud poured some into a glass. 

 " I might as well take the lot," said the man, coming boldly into the room. " You see, the chap's so damned bad, he'll want to uae it oatside as well as in." 

 She answered not a word, bnt let him take the bottle�a fatal mistake, she knew. 

 "Thankyon, miss; much obliged," with a sneer. His bawk-Iike eyes fell npon ber dia mond ring. "The place seems uncommonly quiet No men about The boss not home yet. I suppose?" 

 It tu her last chance. 

 " I hear them coming now," she asserted, with great presence of mind. 

 He atarted, and looked donbtfally at her. A strong wind had risen, and a rumbling noise was beard which might be the tramp o! horses' feet and wheels. Then, with an oath, he seized the bottle and walked off. 

 If she bad any hope, it left her then. And if she had at any time thought of trying to hide or make her escape, that was impossible now, for her limbs Beamed dead�she conld not move to save her life. In all this old wooden house there was not one lock on door 

 or window. 

 So she sat on, never quite losing conscious nen, yet never wholly conscious. She saw that the candle waa slowly burning down ; there was only an inch left now. And the table was doing such mad things ; it would rise slowly up right under her eyes, and sink 

 down again. 

 By this time they would have discovered that the sound was not of horses' hoofs, only the distant tbnnder. which was coming nearer how. Above the moaning of the wind there came the sonnd of men s voices^ 

 raised load and fierce in angry quarrelling.. They mnst he having an angry dispute, for the hut was some distance off. and she conld hear them distinctly, send their voices were coming nearer. Then there was a 

 silence. 

 . Some one waa walking stealthily in the verandah, eautlouedy the door handle was turned, and it opened creakingly. 

 Bessie still sat looking at the table. M My God 1 Bessie, what is this P 

 Slowly she lifted her Btiff eyelids, Bnd as Charlie sprang forward, stood up with an awful shriek o! pent-up agony. 

 "hord save as ! What is it? Oh! my goodness. oh 1 What's to be done wl J6 � gasped Dagftid, stnmbling about in to acit&ted and singularly helpless war. ' � 

 One shriek' followed the other, till Charlie caught hie sister by the shoulders and shook 

 her violently. ... 

 " Stop that!" be roared. "Slop it at once! 

 She Btopped, looked wildly at Charlie, and buret into tears. Thereupon be followed up his treatment by throwing a jug of water over her, after which he made her drink some brandy and water which Dugald had pro* cured. Then, thinking a little kindness might be beneficial, he kissed her affection* ately and carried her to the sofa, where Bhe lay tor some minutes, unable to speak. 

 Under judicious treatment Bessie Blowly revived, and was able to tell her story, Charlie became very excited over it, and in terrupted continually with fragments of " his adventures." . 

 Briefly told, bis explanation was this. He had been out all night working at the tires, and about five in the morning got borne, feeling dead beat He had a nip, turned in, andslepttill eleven o'clock, when little Billy the ronseabout burst into bis room to say Mrs. Bette was dead. So lie was up and out, and found Mrs. Betts with her head on the stove, and her feet near a bucket, which induced Billy to think she bod kicked it _ They found her insensible, with a wound in her head. She evidently had a fit, and struck her bead when she fell. The only thing to be done was to drive ber to the townBhip, 27 miles off, and leave ber at the hospital. It was necessary to take Billy to open the gates, as the woman was still unconscious, ana that was how the house came to be deserted. Of 

 course he bad to stay and rest his horses for | an hour or two, which kept him late. " But I never imagined," said Charlie, "that Dugald would not be home before me, and was astonished when I met him with the two men about three mileB from here." 

 Then DugaM explained how the fire bad gone on to MacPherson's, and it bad taken all their labour to beat it down. 

 " Why I came ao cautiously up the verandah was because 1 wanted to find out who had a light in here, when I knew there ought to be no one in the house," Charlie told Bessie. 

 Dugald had made some tea for Bessie, which she drank gratefully, and also pro* vided a queer kind of supper. 

 " Those brutes!" said Charlie presently;" we must go down, Dugald, and kick them out of the place." 

 " Vou leave them to roe," said Dugald sternly, "and I'll make them remember this night's work," But when they went down to the hut, there was no sign of Bessie's friend, only the red-bearded man sat smoking by the 

 fire. 

 "I'm darned if I'm going to be treated like this," said the man, wrenching himBelf outof Cameron's graBp. " If you want to collar any. one, you can go after that other chap as took to bia beela when he heard you coming. You know me, Mr. Cameron?" It turned out that this man had been woolscouring at (iorringa last year, an J though noted for bis surliness, bore a good character; Taylor had fallen in with the other man on his way to the atation. And the latter soon found out that there wab no one at the place save Miss M'Kenzie, and wanted Taylor to join him in a general pillage, which he had refused to do, and they had come to high words over it, when the arrival of the five men had caused him to decamp. And although the police were ordered to keep a look out for him, he was not Been in that district again. 

 Bessie's nerves were so unstrung by her night's vigil that Charlie took her back to Melbourne immediately. A great doctor prescribed medicine, and a trip to Tasmania. This doctor bestowed on Mr. Charles M'Kenzie a word of praise for the prompt measures which had rescued his sister from hysteria or something worse, "though it left her with a very bad cold," and the young man carried his head very high for some days, 

 1 assure yon. 

 Bessie recovered her health, and last week I noticed her wedding announcement in a 

 society paper.
