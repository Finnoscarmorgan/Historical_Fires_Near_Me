 BOOK ONE. CHAPTER I. 

 By ST. GEORGE RATHBORNE. Author of �Captain Tom," and �Doctor Jack,� 

 " Conrad, my boy, there�s one thing dead certain; we�re in for an experience this time. No:scaling a peak, equal to the Matterhorn to-day. I�ve been lost 

 in an Indian, jungle, caught in advert send-storm, and experienced the dr�fgbta of a Canadian bush fire, which ringed every hair from my head, but they all fade into insignificance- compared with being caught in a fierce snow storm half way up the side 6� 'Moot Blanc/, Conrad, old fellow, suppose you wind that. Switzer horn again�give another caH,.and see whether we can? discover someone, on; the trail .whjch we have, foolishly lost.�. The speaker sho.wa little evidence of the great anxiety ho mentions ; indeed, to see him calmly smoking a oigar while slapping his,hands together in order to induce warmth; doe, would hardly imagine ho knows what alarm - is. And yet bis situation is little less then appalling, to say the least., Ascending terrible- Mont Blanc late in the season, attended, by a single guide, they haye been suddenly overtaken by -the worst snow-blizzard Conrad remembers so early in the. winter.' The beautiful view has been blotted out as if by rinagio,. and around - them whirl cloudy of fine snow that, driven by a co!d |v fierce wind, seam to out the flesh like needles* Others are;on the mountains, too, for theyt have, had glimpses of them from time <to time at a.distance. Through the blinding Buxton abd his guide haveideaoended�nearly half an hour has elapsed aince the rush-of. the blizzard bov gan, and- Conrad at. length, - having lost all traces of the;trail iln the;.-bewildering snow; candidly, admits that-they are� lost, which remark draws.out. the Words with: which, our story opens. . , Sam Buxton- is a.character who would attract attention almost' anywhere. In size he is rather below- the-average, and gives no more, evidence oF muscular ability than icomelinessr�still hisi face* if homely, has au-honestlook that-grows, upon one; and the more you know.of Sam the better you like him. - At any rate; he is fearless, bright asa-new dollar,- full of chivalrous n notions, and plays second fiddle to no-man on : earth. Sam has. been blessed*.with� a goodly proportion of this world�s goods, and travels for pleasure; � though perhaps he may have some hazy sort of design in bis wanderings. At present his; object has been "to plant an American flag upon the. Matterhorn,- a feat.- as yet never accom plished, though, attempted by' many, ah adventurous spirit; Obeying orders, the Swiss .guide, a man who is ready to swear by Baron Sam, as the American;is;sometimes called; raises his hands to his imoutb, abd with all the force of his .powerful lungs sends forth that musical Tyrolese-call which-can only be properly warbled by an Alpine dweller. Through the storm jfc nogs, for the air is remarkably pure . in 1 these - mountain regions. ... .... Baron Sam-puffs� awoy *t bis cigar, while he - strains .his ears' to discover whether there may-be>any response made, tor if by good fortune'' there chances to be a (Switzer guide within.hearing he will readily answer <the call,' as Conrad lias given it dturn >'that is significant of did* tress'; -but it digsiaWay;amid the howling of the bitter 'wind,l and> the surging of the storm alone reaches him, Something , like a. frown creeps over his �heery �face;'bub;ho chases it away, with a laugh, while shruggingihia shoulders as the last squall a weeps'down with, the fury, of demoos letloose. � Phew l-how it' stings yj this ibig v col Urr; on my overboat comdat ip bandy, and these fur gloves,, too. A-wise* bead; -that of yours, Sam .Buxton, toprovide tor. an emergency,-eVen if the weather did look summer-like at -storting. Ono . thing worries me. - Conrad,.'see ,here,� he half shouts, for although' the �Alpine guide < is only half :a.dozen feet-away the-sweep of the wind-renders it impossible to converse' with-the natural'tones. �What.now baron T asks Conrad, who has spent a part�of-bis life upon the sunny. Italian slopes -of the - Alps, and hence - ac quired many of the babits-oMhe people of Aosta. ~, ( . . . tl When you used the glass and spoke of seeing the party below, were there not females in it 1� ' ' �Si, excellency,! saw the flutter ; bf skirti;� replies the-other, who is a ; sturdy fellow, twice as strong as Baron Sam, yet lacking much of the American�s grit., �How many would you say?� � Two at least, signor.� � Confound it, what a foolish thing to bring females up 1 on the exposed aide of Mont Blahc-at this time of year. J, for one, object to women trying such' danger-' j ons experiments they are more suited to the gentle sjde of life�-drawing rpoms,'the drive at Nice, or sight seeing in the cities. Anyhow, if by reason of a great desire to.j climb the Alps they do make tho attempt let it bo in the season�-July or August �not whe-n winter is ready to burst over the and wrap them in a wind ing sheet. Ugh 1 that fairly takes one�s breath away,� as ahotheroxtraordinary gust comes tearing down from the wild region of t thc Matterhorn�that bleak peak reached, by human'feet for the first time ohly a few years, .before, and aij of that adventurous party perishing save on English geDtleraan, a Mr Whymper, and two'guides. �'Wp must push on baron; to remain is death',� exclaims tho guide uneasily/ �Goit old man �Tm agreeable;� and! clinging to such projections, as presents themselves he swings, his body from rock to took with an agility one would hardly j dream he possessed, all the while holding his 6igar between his teeth, and keeping � tight grip upon bis Alpine staff with its pointed, steel shod base, - ' - Thus they flounder Kin for'some time while the blizzard rages furiously around, Conrad is 'alarmed� ifbis �eiiplbyer shows no signs of ifc - and aim bathoses'his' head, but the cheeify Voice of Sam Buxton': steadies him, much as a careful driver soothes a restlesk steed! They make progress, but. it is impos sible to decide, whether it, is ih a right or wrong direction. Perhaps every step; takes them deeper into the depths, since there is no means of tolling whither they go unless tbe guide discovers! some sign that mey be ; familiar/ to him. Thp American tourist is nersistent by, nature, Jtubbprm! (but �yeh v He begins to feel the opljl hand 'of'despair olatobinyt hj| when; msjteaq pf grows more furious,and 

 it iff impossible to see more than two yards in anyidirection. Jove! I reckon we�ll have to wait tor a rescue by .the good monks of St. Bernard. Looks like a: gone case; to mo; ivonjrad. Suppose you give one/more warbln my man, and we�ll see if anything comes but of. tho storm. Jf not, then we must camp as best we oan in timbleuk ?place.� i Tho Swiss guide raises his beriumbed handsi and again that weird Tyrolese call sounds musical in; spite of the raging ~ 8 mo �king - voices,' Once � more* Sain Buxton bends his head to listen, then starts, thrilled ; by strange emotions, for on'the wings bf .tho storm comes a cry. It It is not what he has expected, but even more of a pitiful appeal for help than Conrad's call, - w�* , ( j! )od heaven8 ! man > you hear �that" ho says, clutching the guide by the armi ' Thcre ie Uttle.need to ask, for Conrad is as white as the snow around him, and trembles as though ho might be a human aspen le if, � Yes, I hear it ; the spirit of lost souls that have met their death on Mont Blapc mock us, baron. They beckon to U8 ,� % We are doomed ?� ho almost shrieks,; pointing in tbo;dirootion whence the cry has come. . ? , The, American is; practical, and detests; anything bordering on superstition,- hence be has little, patience with this line of conduct. � You re a fool, Conrad. That cry is for help, and whether it comes from . a lost soul, or a human being in distress; Sam Buxton isn�t tbe man .to hang back; Fbllbw me, or remain where you ore 1� ho, Baron Sara; you- will go to your fateT cries, the guide, and truer words were never uttered, though under another meaning. His employer, with.a' snort of disgust at the man�s superstitious fears, tears away from the grasp that would detain him; and> pushes blindly on .through the ?snow storm to; disco verthosourceof the cry ;ibat hod answered Qonradta call. \\ When he had gone-twenty, paces, with the guide-following, for, Conrad fears.being left alone on the mountain; even- worse than an encounter with,/ the spooks of former , unlucky pilgrims, Sam,* seeing nothing, drops his cigar, and making) . a trumpet of his hands, bellows forth: ? � �{Hello, there I. where are you#� ( -? , , . r^ 0 has y oice hardly in-keeping . with bis body�-a voice that is as strong as the rbar. of a lio.n in the; African forest, and the shrill,/mocking tends of the blizzard king fail to keep it from covering quite an- 'extensive space. , ?' �(This way,; I am too chilled to.'reach you|!� comes a reply very near at band, and, 1 electrified, Sam bounds over �some loose rocks forming a sort; of shelter , from' the blizzard�s- worst fury, to. find himself face to face' with� his fate 1 - 1 � Jerusalem ! it�s a. woman I� he paralysed at the sight that greets hia eyes. A tall, girlish figure, not too warmly clad, trying to. rise and greet him wiih outstretched hand, and; a smile upon her face. Sam marks on the instant what a face it is, strangely, 'beautiful, and yet possessing wonderful independence, as though the owner, were, used to baying her own way and fighting her own battles. , He snatches off his fur glove to accept the proffered hand ; it is almost as cold as ice� being poorly covered with kid gloves, She totters while endeayoring to stand'in the snow, and bold Sffm, equal to, the> emergency, .swings his; other arm about her�his.head is- thus- brought �close' tb hers, and she hears him say : �� Pardon, miss or madam ; this is no time for etiquette, and you were falling. Allow me,� and without waiting fpp. a reply, his tears the mockery of gloves, from her' hands, rubbing the. frigid members between his own worm 'ones until be has succeeded in producing, a glow, after, which he draws the fur gloves -over. her bands�never minding her feeble pro* tests. Nor does this American chevalier bait there, but, throwing, off;. his outer coat, proceeds to wrap, the, lady in it. � She makes a s traggie against, thp action, but {His [will � conquers, and she can only murmur the thanks . of her heart/ which do not tell one quarter as much, as the glances from her wonderfully large and expressive eyes. � Conrad, we must make a last effort for this lady�s sake. Lead on, man. If you save us it is five hundred lire in your pocket. The path, man�find us the path that loads to the monastry.� Sparred on by the hope of making a small fortune, as_well as saving his own life,' the Alpine guide again moves, on, while Sam follows, leading the unknown' lady who owes her life to him,half bearing her, in fuct, for she is almost chilled tp the marrow.� Death stares them in the face, and even the bold : hearted American groans as he feels his strength giving out. She hears and understands. � Leave me�save yourself, I beg !� she cries, almost pleadingly, but bp smiles and shakes bis bead. � While there�s life there�s hope. One thing you must understand�we> live or die together, since fate has (brown os in contact ! have some fight in me yet.; On,' Conrad,, on ; we must find the � trail.� Now. );e staggers himself; the exertion is telling, upon even, that indomitable spirit, but with set, teeth and, straining muscles,, 8pm Buxton .continues to push on after the hardy guide; while the storm rages and the, soow uppn . the �ground in creasescontinually in depth.; Hope that anchor to the. soul, bps become almost dpad within them, when' suddenly he hears a shout abeadi It comes, from Conrad, andaa his eyes fall upon that worthy , he has a faint glimpse of him dancing madly upon the snow, � The post, Baron Sam 1 the pps& that marks the spot where Monsieur Oarot was murdered ! It was blessed by holy men ;<it has been an instrument in saving us. The path is here I� he shouts, � Thank Hoovon 1� groans the exhausted Sam, � If wo can hold out ten minutes more, dear master, wo are saved. Leave . the lody here wrapped in your coat, and run with roe.� � Never ! Show mo the path, man end then do you hasten below for help, while r try and keep tho spark of life in both our bodies. Leave the lady I will not. Como! be speedy�do you hear me T almost roughly, for the man�s words have out to tho,quick�as though ho had ever been guilty of leaving one in distress whoin fortune had thrown on h|s hands�while she rewards hiipo witha single look (bat warms his heart. �It is urinMeseary, Baron. Praise Heaven and iliepaints.' I hear voices pbbve, ' the lady's party descending. In a minute they are lioro. Yes w;p, are saved,� and then Sam realises, . from the heavy weight on his arra tlmt the unknown lady has swooned. . , ' , Conrad�s words, prortru�, draw nearer, and in hardly more than ; a minute a party of persons appear through 

 the | blinding, surging anew, hurrying downward, the guides leading, and keep* mg - a. bright lookout, for there . is always extreme danger of rat a; time like this, and that me&\\$eV>i ble disaster. . . . Muny. bavo lo?t their live/in of the Alps,, whiloo there wandefi^g : aboiit v ; fall (over some precipice, or it overwhelmed by the . that' comes tearing down the: side of JtBif mountain, sweeping /. every thing : in its path into a chaotic mass far below.;. :i . Ajlready has Oonrad hailed, the guides, and las the party discover Sam holding the 'senseless form of the lost lady their cries of wonder and;/praise. soundearnest,: indeed, for they have given op all hope of ever; seeing her again. By accident she had .become separated from her party just at the tune the storm, without 'much warning swept over Mont Blanc�their cries were unanswered, and they des paired. � Allow me to carry her, ray dear sir,� says a voice that gives the American a shock, for he finds himself looking into the face of the best friend he ? has on earth, a man six feet in height, and finely' proportioned�a Hercules beside .a pigmy when compared; with Sam. - , ., � Dudley MoLan<s, �or all the. world !� he ahoutSi �Good heavens! is it yon your ghost; I believed you in Egypt,� roars the giant, infolding the other in bis arms* mad at the same time, of course, clasping - the senseless girj; �Easy, old boy; you forget! None of your bear bugs here ! I believed you home in Ganada. This is, indeed, a strange meeting,� , � Where did you find Atleen T asked: the other, and Sam starts at mention of the name, whether because of its singular nature, or for some other reason, he does nob choose to state. - � Wandering in the storm�we were also, lest, and had Just found the path before you came,�, Sam replies, stillhold:' ing l he senseless form of the girl, whom he seems loth to give up�did he not save her, and does .not that, in a measure, give i him; a claim upon her 1 I . � Come, the guides are muttering and .i threatening to desert, unless we ; move on. Give me the girl, Sam ; 1 am better able to carry her.� . Pardon, signor, allow neio relieve you of your burden. ( I have : some right to assist the beautiful young .lady, says a soft voice in.Sam?* oar, a voice be; recognises as that of an Italian,- and j turning his bead, he finds one of the party close to him, a man who. has a graceful, willowy figure, un Adonis in looks, with a face tbatepmehow frank Sam. Buxton dislikes on sight. My friend spoke ahead of you, signor; he has therefore the first claim, and with the .word? Sam transfers bis burden to the Canadian, whose heart is like (he trees of bis .native country, sturdy.and un-, bending. 3omething,Iike a deep.curse drops from the lips of .the Italian os he turns, aside, and knowing these hot blooded people well, Sam Buxton realises that by his action he has probably made a bitter enemy, ,who hereafter < give him trouble, for which he cares little, indeed, being generally able to look out for him* self. By this time the clamoring guides are threatening mutiny nnless the decent is continued. Sam notices that they look to bis friend the Canadian, as though fear of him is the only thing that keep* them' from immediate desertion. He smiles, for Dudley. McLane.. about him of commanding obedience. His figure and tremendous voice make him a natural leader in the field though as a usual thing Sam has been the general who planned their*work in past adventures. They resumed their decent, each step: taking them nearer the Hospice of St. Bernard, whose doors will warmly receive them. Sam notes that the remaining lady of the party is evidently one who has acted as escort and chaperon to the younger traveller. She, too, is about ex- that two of the guides have to carry her. The blizzard still keeps op in all its fury, and there is not one among them who does not express tho most profound satisfaction when before them arise the hospitable walls of the monastery that for such long years has been a blessing to,travellers and lost Alpine guides. . Here a warm welcome awaits them from the monks, whose lives are devoted to this work, and whoso fame has become world-wide. The ladies are revived and made comfortable in a warm room, while tho men seek warmth and good cheer in the large reception hall, whore a great fire blazes. Sara Buxton draws his Canadian friend aside. There are a number! of other touristspresent, who have ventured up the sides of Mont Blanc- and . whom the terrible blizzard aent back. ? Glad indeed,, are all of them to find such shelter from the storm. Sam has questions to ask, and Dudley, on his part, desires to learn how tos friend of many an adventure in the past chances to be here. These two men have journeyed in com 1 - pany over half the World ; their tastes ran much in common, and both are keen sportsmen. McLane'has'shown Sam the i delights of saltoda fishing on the rivers of Canada, and the pleasure of moose hant* ing, while Buxton;* bn the other band, baa led the chase� of the elk-in the 1 tracked 'the grizzly bear to � bis* den. - Ton called the lady I had the honor to servo by a queer name�I have never heard it but once�Aileen-iwas that� it l Sam asks. , " .

Baron Sato ' grunt I think I have bear'd of theto before, ho remarks, quietly, and, then adds � See hero, Dud, perhaps you are ia ! love with the hditess ?� f At qbls the bluff Canadian laughs good naturedly. �To confess the truth, my dear fellow,! have conceived quite an ardent attachment for tho lady, but the trouble |a she fails, to .return it.

What I am going to ask of you may teem a little odd, but I have my reasons for - it, and and at some future time will explain all to you.� � Bosh F ejaculates Dud, with a laugh, V speak out like a man.� ' ��.For the present I would keey my last name a secret from Aileen �?Winchester,� says Sam, 1 � How pal he has the name,� thinks the Canadian, and then, adds, aloud* � Of course it ahallbeos you say, although I hardly know how it can be done when introducing you�she will be sure to ask after her preserver,� � Preserver ! Fiddlesticks ! Conrad had as much to do with it os myself, in a way. But I can give you a hint. Conrad �yes, oven the beautiful Beatrix � Paoli, calls me Baron Sam, � Strange ns it biay appear, introduce roe under that name. You know my in other married a second time, and my step-father�s name was Fletcher. In some way I shall cause her to believe I atn a Fletcher, but for the present introduce me ; ns Baron Siim. , McLaue looks at his companion quoerly�it is so unusual for Sam to stoop to any deception that he cannot understand it. ' suppose it�s all right, old boy�yes, 1 know it is, coming froin ; you. I�ll follow out your plan, only there may come a break at any time�a fellow is apt to make a slip of the tongue, you know.�. �A thousand thanks, old chap�will explain later. You know me, Dud, and can rest assured that my motives are strictly honorable,� with which he drops the subjedt oiid speaks of other things. Night has come, the storm hastening the close of day, and the good monks proceed to make their guests as comfort able as the circumstances will allow. They form a chery-party in all and having so fortunately escaped' the rigor of the storm, they are disposed to bo merry over it. The ladies appear, looking none the worse for their adventure. Aileen come straight up/to where Sam chances to be standing, and holds out her hand. He is charmed with her impulsive ways�this daughter of the' -Sierras has a fine scorn for much of the false etiquette society favors�she acts from her heart, and not through studied ways. � To you I am indebted for my ' life. I thank you from my heart, sir,� she says in low tones. For the second time Sam tokos her hand* not as he did : before, to rub warmth into the benumbed digits, but nevertheless he* squeezes it while keeping his eyes fastened bn hers. �;I beg that you will not mention Winchester. ; It� is'a man�s business' to lend a helping hand to any fellow creature in distress. In turn I amj under�obligation�s� t6~lhes6 ?holy men" for shelter, so you. see the debt is in a measure cancelled.� It is neatly put;� but she smiles in 1 replying: �They'can be repaid. The box at thb door yonder is open to voluntary con tributions, while I may never hope to rescue you from peril.� � Who knows 1 Strange thihgs happen sometimes in this world of ours, .Mias Winchester.' Think of two friends, one : supposed to be in Egypt and the other in Canada, meeting in a fierce snow-squall on the side of Mont Blapo�that seems improbable, and yet it is what has oc curred between Dudley McLano and my self this day.� � You know Mr McLane, then t� with surprise. Sam opens his mouth to exclaim that they have beenjboon companions on many a jaunt* slept under the same blanket, and bled for each other, but he suddenly remembers something, and quietly remarks that they have met. Slie branches out into describing her Aunt Dorothy�s great regard/for Mr McLaue, and, of course, Sam* is ready to agree with all that is of hie friend, and even go several points 1 better. All the while be' is conscious of the' fact that .a pair of burning eyes are glued upon Him, and that Count Tivoli watches his tete-H-tote witb Aileen in a state of sullen auger, as though the. jealous Italian has already recognised a possibly dangerous rival in the American. [ ?� Presently McLsne comes' up with Dorothy and the Now England spinister squeezes Sam�s hand warmly, calling him the saviour of her wayward darling, and vandusiike terms; until the other blushes bonehth hip tan/ and turns the conversation. ' McLane has iutroducep biro simply as � My old.friend, - ' Baron Stym,� and the ladies are not�rude qnbjigh �to'question further,;, though they 'mpat' t'hiuK-this a strange title. ; ' Thb supparspread by the . monks' i? bountiful, even if the variety of'viands is' 'limited, and as�hunger has coine upon them with thbruehof cold.wbather, all do justice tp the repast. When this com pany depart - from (bo monastery the free will box oh the wall 1 mush be ' heavier for their coming, - if they have any gratitude in their �souls. For tiie night they are given such ac comadatibns as tho monastery will admit. The storm must be short-lived, as Winter can hardly have set in,' arid with the coming of day they mhy�find ah op portunity to detobnd to the ,bakb ; of the mountain,�where their means' of. trans portation await them. ' ? MoLaoo has studied for the surgical profession, and has boon called upon by bob of the monks to perform a difficult operation for a member of the order who has suffered for some time, so thhfc it is lote whon he makes his way . tovfhrd the cell which bo and Sain share' In�cbmmon. : . dHAPTER III. , , f) .

Fortune may send us trouble on our way hence but to-night �My life depends upon the faithful execution of this little weapon,� says Sam, smiling grimly. �Duse.take it old man, what mystery are you hinting at 1 Surely the innocent grajpejuice of these good monks hasn�t mounted to.your brain 1� At this sam laughs aloud, as though tickled at the allusion, which he can afford to treat lightly. � A serious business, I assure you Dud. Siuoe last I saw your cherry counten ance I have passed through an ex perience.� � Ah!� � I�ve had a visitor,, ray dear boy.�j � Good heavens ! not Aileen 1 No, I�m silly to think of it. Has Miss Dorothy been calling to discover who your antecedents were ? She�s a great stickler for pedigree, especially when in her mind the person involved may turn out a possiblesuitor for the hand of her wealthy word.� Sam cannot refrain from a roar at this. � You�ll discover the fact for yourself, so it�s as well to be prepared. That�s why she has favored the count, you know.� � Ah, yes, the count,� mutters Sam, fiercely scrawling. �Ho has a pedigree that dates back to the time of Columbus�-think of it. The old spicister went into ecstasies over it ; but, sad to say, her opinions have no weight whatever with the independent Aileen.� � That is fortunate for the rest of us, else we should be cultivating the good will of the spinister instead of Miss Aileen, and Heaven preserve me from that,� with a look of mock tragedy.� � But your visitor�you haven�t told me who he was,� persists Mct.ane, who like most of his countrymen, having �Scotoh blood in his veins, is very determined, and when once a notion strikes him he is apt to carry it out to tho end. � True. You see, I was sitting here, looking over my note-book, when there came a tap at my door, I called out �enter* and two moo pushed io.� � Monks ?� � Not at all�Count Tivoli aod a friend, also an Italian, a Colonel Some body.� � I know�Colonel Marches!�a man who has been a mystery to me. I have 'imagined all sorts of things in connection with him, even believing at one time be was the in fanjous, brigand Fra Diavolo.' wEose name is so greatly feared in Northern Italy,� � What made you think that, Dud 1� V The face bears a resemblance to a picture I have seen of that man�that�s all I had to round roy suspicious upon, but forgot it Sam.
