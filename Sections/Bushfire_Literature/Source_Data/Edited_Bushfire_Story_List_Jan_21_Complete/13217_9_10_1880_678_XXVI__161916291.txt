 Two boats are floating under a clump of osiers that cast a deep green shadow on the glittering water. It is 6 o'clock, and still very hot; the wind blowing over the parched sands of the continent has been very little cooled by its passage across the straits. The smoke from bush fires hangs like a dense veil round the horizon. We ore embarking. Mr. and Mrs. M'Intyre seat them selves in the larger boat ; Mrs. Forrester takes possession of the cushions in the stern of the smaller one, which Mr. Moore has volunteered to pull. A glance passes between 

 Belle and me, and we tacitly agree not to disturb the tetea ' There is room for another here,' says Mr. Moore. No one takes any notice of his remark, and, after a moment's pause, he pushes the boat out into the stream, and propels it forward with long, swift strokes. Papa and Alf M'Intyre take each an oar, and follow more slowly with their heavier freight. 'Does sJie ever talk about him ?' I say, vaguely, in a low tone to Belle, my eyes fixed onthe pair before us. ' Yes, indeed,' returns Belle, understanding me, ' she talks of him until I hate the very sound of his name. It is * Lawrie did this, or does that, or used to do the other,' ad iftjfniltim. You know she went over to Charlemont yesterday ? ' ' Thank goodness, she can't steer a bit,' I burst forth. ' Look, he is fastening the tiller-ropes, so that she cannot do any more mischief. I beg your pardon, Belle, you were saying she went to Charlemont.' ' Yes. According to her own account, she used her privilege of cousinship to criticise very freely. She says she has persuaded Mr. Moore to make several alterations. But one thing she is very much vexed about, she wants him to turn the fernery into an orchard-house, but he will not.' 14 Fancy her imagining that he would. As if he would have all he spent on those lovely ferns wasted, even for her.' ' Oh ! but that is the very point which has annoyed her. 4 Lawrie is so tiresome,* he told her that he did not care a straw for the expense, but it was hie whim that the fernery should not be altered, and he did not intend to allow a leaf to be touched.' A ray of hope steals through my soul (it is these rays of hope which make the darkness more intense when they have died out.) Mr. Moore does not profess a fondness for ferns �4an my penchant be the spring which moves him to refuse his cousin's request? ' I can see plainly,' proceeds Belle,' that it will not be Mrs. Forrester's fault if she is not one day mistress at Charlemont. She hints pretty plainly at former love passages between Mr. Moore and herself, but then, one must always take her assertions with a grain of salt.' ' That assertion is time enough,' I sav, gloomily. 'Is it? How do you know?' ' He told mo long before Mrs. Forrester ever came here. What is her version of the story.' ' Oh, she leads one to infer � she does not commit herself to matter-of-fact statements � that he wanted to marry her, but on account of his wildness the match was broken off.' For a moment I am struck dumb by the unparalleled effrontery of this audacious perversion of the truth. When I do speak, it is with more contempt than anger. ' On, she says that, does she ? I shall know how much credence she ie entitled tc. Is it not wonderful, Belle,' I continue pensively, ' how little men care for anything but a pretty face. They have all gone perfectly wild about Mrs. Forrester, and she hasn't anything but her beauty; she is as stupid and ignorant as I am, and she can't use her muscles any more than her brains. Apropos, I am going to take an oar. 'Will you take the other ? ' Belle assents, but papa objects. ' It is much too hot. Harrie. Why can't you be content to be idle for a time. I am quite sure Mies M'Intyre does not wish to row.' So we are fain to eubeide, contenting ourselves with a promise that we shall bo allowed to take the oars for the last half mile. When they are, at length, handed over to us, we do not find their possession so enchanting after alL The current is against us, also the wind, and five minutes pulling in this intense heat makes me red-hot, and Belle white. She is wiBe enough to relinquish her oar to her brother, but withja foolish obstinacy, I cling to mine, although my face is 

 becoming momentarily more scarlet, and I well know TT ? hideous ib my appearance when 1 am heated w HE We have been passing between low, Mnrlv ehe-io- K banks the whitened grass sloping into' filFSte*!?* I green frmge of rushes. Now the banks are rather high� *2 I are edged with blossoming ten-trees, whose white petah Cf I in Enowy flakes upon the stream. We pass C I I I narrow strait, almost choked by trailing water-wllf I which cling around the keel, and wind about our oar-IS 1 -two more stokes and our destination is reached Z BJackwood Ford is before us. A stretch of shallow� 4_? a crystal mirror in which one may count the pebble* i nth' river's bed ; a little cascade gurgling over a low dam �f__ blackwood trees standing sentinels to guard the pae'sZ one at either end. --a�Baget Mr. Moore has fastened his boat to the twisted roo s nf � gum-tree, and stands beside Mrs. Forrester at tie 'ton of the hank. '* or 'Oh! dear, how terribly hot you are,' she save '�* I struggle up, disdaining any assistance ; � How c ouid'vou get in such a state ? I don't feel it the least bit t oo warn to-day. The sight of her cool neatness, more than her wnrd� enrages me. ''�? '� You have net been rowing,' I say, curtlv. 'No, Lawrie would not let me; he neverwill let me do anything he does not like, and he has such a preiudim against ? ' . l ' ' Good gracious,' I cry, tartly, ' I ought to krlc-w all his prejudices by heart by this time. It is a p!;tv parole encourage him in such nonsense. Belle, let us trn and s� where we will light the fire.' K tt '* Alf M'Intyre joins us, and we fix on the etui mf an aged gum, decayed into a hollow below the lev -el the ground, as our fireplace. A skilfully erected pile cicks is soon blazing, with the large, black, kettle poise ??d the top. The others have strolled up and stand idl 'mnd Our desultory chat somehow comes round to aim fortitude. ' Horrid creatures� the Spartans,' says Mrs. I foster with a shudder. ' I can't bear to think of them.' ' ' 

 'Then why do so? They probably never . 6ted. History is only a tissue of fiction and exaggerated ict ' Thus Mr. Moore. ' I must differ from you. It is absurd to talk j that reckless way;' objects Mr. M'Intyre, who takes eve rfhras aupicd de lalctlre; 'the events of history arc, , ^dj down to us on the authority of men whose test 'm ny ig unimpeachable.' ' Men of whom wa know nothing but the nami & and those probably fictitious.' ! ' Ridiculous ! ' mutters Mr. M'Intyre, turning artLy in disgust, followed by his wife and my father. f ' I don't believe people could have voluntarily ei Wed tortures as they say the Spartans did,' opines Mrs. Forrester. 41 1 don't know,' I say, more for the sake of differing from her than for any other reason, ' I am sure I could I voluntarily inflict pain on myself if I were in the mood.' I ' Only you never would be in the mood,' she insiE.uates.. I 44 1 don't think stoicism is your forte,' remarks Mr. I Moore. ' I shall believe in your voluntarily inflicting pain I on yourself when 1 6ee it.' , ? ' If you say much more, 1 will give you the i pportu- 8 nity,' I exclaim. ' ' I ''' There Lawrie, a challenge,' laughs my enem; , in her most dulcet tones. ' Take it up,' I ciy hotly. 4- Tres bien ! Here, in the presence of these \\ri( esses, I dare you to take up this kettle and pour some of ie water over your arm.' The water is boiling furiously, the kettle's lid ra tiing up and down with the force of the imprisoned steam. 'You dare me to do it? All right.' I sp,-ak quite quietly, and slip off my cuff. ' Harrie, you 6hall not do anything so fof h. Mr. Moore, I wonder you can persist,' cries Belle, � n indig nation. At her appeal, Mr. Moore turns towai. ju-her, hut before he can speak, my evil genius again steps lh ' It is not .Lawrie who persists, Miss M'J Inre, Miss Erekine has challenged him to put her to the pr.r' oo now wo want to see whether her Spartan bravery is all i br.' Like a match applied to gunpowder, or a lif ;W brand flung on a heap of dry furze, Mrs. Forrester's \\(\\ Is fall o& my ears. In an instant I spring forward, seize t ie kettle burning my right hand with the hot handle� ijpd dash a considerable quantity of the scalding water ovr : my wrist and arm. ?; 'Are you eatisfied?' 1 ask, turning defiat Jy on Mr.. ? Moore, though my lips are quivering with tl c stinging ? pain. ? 

 Chapter XXVII. The pain I am enduring� and I always think burning or scalding one's flesh causes the most torturing ku 1 of pain is yet considerably mitigated by the fact that fc ; once Mrs. Forrester is extinguished, while I am the he�ineof the hour. Papa is too much distressed to think ^ giving me the scolding I well deserve ; Mr. and Mrs. M'tityft ejacn late severally, 'How senseless' and ' Ho v.f shocking,'' and regard me� the one with disapproval, tic- other wife commiseration. Their son is filled with admi-ation for my prowess, coming up at intervals to gaze at me, and to exclaim, ' My word, you are a trump.' Bellt is proud of. my exploit and tenderly pitying of my pain, though she tries Sard to be severely condemnatory. M'. Moore is endeavouring, by present devotion, to efface tb recollection. of his past misdeeds. He hurries to the baskets� whither - Belle has already flown � to fetch the oil intjeaded fur the salad, and hastily tearing his handkerchief into strips, insists on dressing my arm himself. ; ' It is the only wuy I have of showing 'try penitence; though, upon my honour, I never for one mo Jient supposed you would take up my challenge, or I would have hanged myself sooner than have uttered it. You believe that? ' I smile incredulously. ' I am not sure.' 14 You only say that out of perversity,' he intreats, paus ing in his task of winding a bandage of cambric round my arm to look down at me with an expression of the tendered reproach in his liquid eyes. ' Make haste, or let Belle do this,' I say, with ungrate ful impatience. ' Here are more wounds,' and I hold out my right hand with its reddened and blistering palm. '4 Mm Dicu ! how did you do that ? ' 41 With the handle of the kettle. It was red-hot, I believe. Have they made up the fire again? Are they getting tea?' Yes, Belle has soen to that; she is busy making the coffee, and by the time my burns are dressed, tea is ready. The cloth is spread under a wattle-tree, with an embank ment of shawls and rugs around it for 6eate. The eataWes look tempting� cold fowls, salad, little brown loaves, rolls of white bread, cakes of all sorts and 'sizes, pats of golden butter, pitchers of cream, dishes heaped with fragrant pyramids of strawberries, raspberries, and cherries. Certainly through no effort of my own. I find myeelt seated next to Mr. Moore. Never was cavalier more atten tive. My wants are not only supplied, but anticipated, and as my right hand is almost useless, I find it n^6'? to have my chicken cut up, and my bread spread wtn butter, a Venfant. � T *' I never thought you could make such a good nurse, i eay, laughing. .. , T ' You never think I can do anything, how, though l have never had any one to look after, 1 am quite oonvwcea that I should shine as a sick nurse,' 'No.nnftBi'� please, I like cafe noir.' This to Belle, who is officiating as hostess, on account of my invalided condition. ' I think you would,' she says, referring to his ftftw* for a sick nurse, not to his penchant for cafe now- � you have a quick eye, a light step, and presence of mind. 'And a soft touch,' I supplement, 'as my bandageo arm can testify.' � . , . ..� t.:r 'What! A good word from you\\ This !-sinhng ^ voice-' Will be one of the white days in my cataul� A word of praise from you has been rarer than ever, 'That shows you have not deserved praise. I gi� every one his due.' . ._._ 44 Even the-ahem ? What will you have no* strawberries ? Eva, may I trouble you for the cream. .. � ' You make a capital waiter; does he not, Miss Erstme. ehe askB, with a malicious smile. ...... ?� that 44 Grand merei ! You should know my capabilities m ^JSKt^ftat this remark is P-jJJ ironical, but Mrs. Forrester is acute enough to tan ^SeW I should. Noone could have waited on me more 

 ' r''7�flv and I '�with an irresistible glance of deprecat ^eTlS-^' have been horribly ungrateful.' ffl�S Heavens! How frightfully her tone jars! How *2wft voice rasps every nerve into a quivering pain ! KLihose eloquent eyes arouse every evil passion dormant in H liSast In the tumult of my feelings, I clench my ?^K forgetful of my scorched palm, and am recalled to if hv a thrill of pain that makes me wnthe on my �Ko 'I say, abruptly, and rising to my feet.

A pause ensues. A fob leaps in the water below us� the circles widen and widen till they reach the opposite bank. ' I am afraid,' resumes my companion, ?' that you are suffering very much. You are dreadfully pale.' 'My arm is �- painful,' I say, with a trembling lip, and flushing to my forehead. ' 1 thought so. Is there nothing I can do for you,' he erics gathering himself up into a kneeling posture before me, ' ' Will you have your arm dressed again ? No ? 'Well I am afraid that would not do much good. I shall never forgive myself for being the cause of this. I had far Kither you had been proved a coward than a Spartan, at euch a cost.' ' It was no proof of bravery. I am ashamed to think of it. It was only an outbreak of temper.' ' Ah ! there was not one of as who would have followed toot example, however violent our tempers. You should rot Iry to depreciate ? ' Again the tea-tree shelter is 'Laurie!' says Mrs. Forrester. Then, with a little start�' Oh, I beg pardon. Shall not I be de trop ? I thought you were alone, Laurie.' I know this must be a lie for it would be utterly impossible to see Mr. Moore and te 'overlook me. Rising with dignity, 1 step out on the lark. ' I do not know whether your cousin will consider you de tnp, Mrs. Forrester, I shall not, for I am going to Miss H'lntyre.' 'Indeed I am not at all afraid of boring Laurie,' she returns, with unvarying sweetness in her tone, but triumph in her eyes. Much ruffled, I6eekthe scene of our tea drinking. It is deserted by all except Mrs. ftl'Intyre, who sils alone on a camp-stool, like a pelican in the wilderness, ?sketching. She sketches very well, and I stand looking over lier shoulder, watching with lively interest the effect of her pencil's rapid strokes. ' I wish I could draw ; it is so stupid to have no accomplishments,' I say, heaving a regretful sigh. ' You do very well without any ordinary accom plishments,' she savs, kindly. ' You know my Alf thinks there is no one like you. I am so glad you and Belle are cuch friends� you havo done her so much good. She ex ?yected to be so lonely when we first came here, and she feels it bo kind of you to make the first advances, and come so �ften to sec her, for really we can never go anywhere. I may talk as long as I h'ke, but Mr. M'Intyre will not listen to reason. ' Do you want fresh water ? ' I ask, hurriedly, for Mrs. H'lntyre, once fairly started on the subject of her husband's misdeeds, is about as easy to stop as a locomotive at full speed. ' Yes, I think I do. But don't you trouble.'* ' It is no trouble,' I say, walking off with the glass. As 2 come up from the river I see two people approaching us. Hre. M'Intyre perceives them also. 'Ah! there are Eva and Mr. Moore. I suppose we ?hall have to dance at their wedding soon.' ' You think they are engaged ? ' I ask faintly. ' Well, I suppose to. Eva is a dreadful flirt, and makes all the gentlemen fall in love with her, but I think she Means to marry her cousin. Charleniont is such a nice f lace that she would not mind spending the summer there ; and as they would haveheapB of money, they could travel fer the rest of the year.' 'But this is all Mrs. Forrester's side of the question. Are Mr. Moore's sentiments assured ? ' ' There can be no doubt of his feelings,' says Mrs. ITIntyre, decidedly, ' He comes to our house constantly now, bo I have ample opportunity of judging, and of course there is nothing on earth to stand in the way of their aarriage.' Kothing! Nothing on earth ! Not the. remembrance �I his cousin's cruel duplicity, of the evil she has wrought ?n his life ! These are forgotten. Men's memories are so short, their hearts so forgiving towards a pretty sinner. It koote not to them that the heart be black, if the form that aehroudsitbefair! The subjects of our late discourse have joined us, and in a few moments more the rest of the party appear over ue top of the hill. Never have I seen Belle look so pretty. Her hands are full of maiden hair, which she waves glee ftiiy before me, her hat pushed back off her face, her yellow tor ruffled. What a relief it is to turn to her and look isto her honest eyes after contemplating the practised vukaes of Mrs. Forrester � the sudden glances through the l�ng lashes, the shy dropping of the eyelids. 'Why did you not come with us?' cries Belle. 'It has been such fun ; we have had such a scramble. It is tte prettiest place possible up there, and Mr. Erskine is the wet of cicerones. Just see all the fern-roots he has got f� me.' � ' The eouleur de rose mist through which Miss M'Intyre m viewed everything is reflected in her cheeks, isn't it, Harne i says papa, smiling. He too, is in high spirits. � vr�Ur way ? own t0 tiie b�at8- Mr- Moore speaks to me. Mies Erekine, may I offer you a seat in my boat ? ' No, thank-you,' I reply, quietly. '0. . It is much more comfortable than the larger cue. ' My aim is not likely to let me be comfortable any where, and I had much rather talk to Belle.' Of coursA I know that my society cannot offer the same attractions as Miss M'Intyre's, but yet, out of kindness to ae-as a pledge that I am forgiven for being the indirect arose of the pain you are enduring, will you not come with Jflcf ,, For. a moment I waver. Mr. Moore's voice is as tte voice of the syren. But no ! I am resolved for once to � arm.
