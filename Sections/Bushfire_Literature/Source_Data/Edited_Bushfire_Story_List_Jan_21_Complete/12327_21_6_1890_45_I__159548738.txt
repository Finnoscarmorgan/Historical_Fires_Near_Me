 MY WEDDING DAY. 

 A SOUTH AUSTBA1JAN STORY. 

 [From Chambers's Journal.X 

 In Two Chapters.�Chapter I. 

 Well, Miss Grey, you arc going to have �? scorcher," said Mr. Green as he greeted me one summer morning. 

 I would gladly have doubted his word, for it 

 was Christmas Day, and, moreover, my wedding . day as well; but early as it was, the sun wan shining from a cloudless sky�"shining with all his mightand though he had browned the grass, and baked the earth, and pumped up every drop of water long ago, leaving nothing but hot stones in the creek beds, he set to work as earnestly as if he had just taken a contract 

 to dry up the deluge and wanted to get done � 

 in time. 

 "Ah, well," I said, trying to make the best of it�" all, well, blessed is the bride the sun shines on, you know." 

 I left tne shady verandah, and went across to the woolshed to give a finishing touch to the wedding breakfast, already laid there on a long table improvised for the occasion. Only the decorating part was left to me; and as I arranged such greenery and flowers as I had, i he old saw kept running in my head, "Blessed :'s the bride tne sun shines on." Surely the i men is true this once, for was there ever such a splendid fellow as Jack, or such a lucky girl : s I ? I changed my opinion of old saws before 

 he day was over; but there, that's telling. 

 Then I thought of my past life, and wondered ' if I was the same Mary Grey who, two years . �yes, only two years ago, had been All alone 

 in the world. I remembered my timid, scared feeling at being among strangers when I came as governess to this up-country run. How queer the life had seemed at first, and how home-like it seemed now. It was hard to realize that I could ever be afraid of Mrs. Green, who was like a loving mother to me. I soon got to like my work too; and then� yes, then came Jack, and had things been ever so bad, life would have seemed coulcur dc 

 rose to me. 

 So I was dreaming over my work on that hot Christmas morning thirty years ago, when I waajjdisturbed by Minnie Green. "Oh, Miss Grey," she said, "Mr. Rushton has come, and Mr. Stanley" [Dick Stanley was to be Jack's best man], "and Mr. Bruce, and,�with em phasis�" the parson 1 Such a funny little man, Miss Grey, with yellow hair, and a pink face like a baby's, and white hands. Do parsons always have pink faces and white 

 hands T" 

 I never had an opportunity of answering this question, for just then Jack appeared, and Minnie having gone to have another look at the cleric English complexion and white hands ?which had so impressed her, we fell into a conversation, interesting enough to ourselves, but of no concern to outsiders, till we were in terrupted by Mrs. Green. 

 "Well, upon my word," she said, "what on earth can you two have to talk about? Come, Mary; it is time for you to think of dressing. You can't have anything very particular to say to Jack here; and if you_ have there is all the rest of your life to say it in." With which profound remark she sent Jack to the dining room, where a picnic sort of first breakfast was going on; and taking me to my room she brought me a cup of tea, and told me to rest a little, for I had a thirty-mile ride before me. 

 Now, though my dress was simple in the extreme, and I could have put it on myself in five minutes, being a bride I must be dressed. Mrs. Green and Minnie, who was to be my bridesmaid, undertook this office, and hindered me sadly. My dress was plain white muslin, simply made, and I had not intended wearing a veil; but Mrs. Green said that as they seldom saw a wedding, and she did not suppose I would be married again in a hurry, I might as well do the thing in style while I was about it; so, to please her, I shrouded myself in a length of plain tulle that covered me almost from head to foot, and really the effect was rather good. 

 At last I was dressed; but somehow we managed to be late, and it was a quarter of an liour behind time when I went across to the woolshed on Mr. Green's ann; while Biddy held an umbrella over my head, and Mrs. Green followed sticking in utterly unnecessary pins to the very last moment. Every one was waiting; and the shed, decorated with such greenery as was available, looked quite festive. At one end stood the breakfast-table with the cake, home made, but imposing, a towering monument to Mrs. Green's housewifely skill. By a small table stood the clergyman in his surplice, looking a trifle out of place; while round about [ were ranged all available seats from chairs to milking-stools and slab benches with stick I legs. They were all occupied, for, as I have 

 already said, a wedding was not an every-day I occurrence, and people had turned out in full 

 force. 

 We advanced with all possible decorum, and the ceremony proceeded as usual till the ring had been put on and the blessing given, when someone, breathless and dusty, dashed in at 

 the door and cried�" Fire! Bush fire! Close here!" Instantly most of the forms were upset, 

 and there was a rush for the door. 

 "Hi! Stop a minute," cried Jack, as he col lared his two friends $nd dragged them .back ; " we will get this over how." 

 The clergyman hesitated, then skipping a good deal, he began the exhortation in which wives get so much good advice and husbands 

 so little. 

 " Oh, nevermind all that,"cried Jack, stomp ing with impatience; "we will have the 'amazement' and all the rest of it some other time. What have we to sign ? Be quick.". 

 Jack's friends made the poor clergyman show where we had to sign; and we aU did it in a desperate hurry, the two witnesses sorawling something when their turn came and bolting at once. Jack just took me in his arms ana gave me a hurried kiss. " Good-by, dear little wife," he whispered�" good-byand he was gone, leaving the clergyman and me alone together. 

 He (the clergyman) was ayoung man justoub from home. He had a clear complexion, and fair hair parted down the middle, and was alto gether themildestlookinglittleman imaginable, his little round face just now displaying the blackest possible astonishment. "Yehusbands �loveth himself�ye wives�subject�plaiting of hair and wearing of gold�amazement," he muttered incoherently, looking from me, stand ing alone in my white veil ana dress, to the de serted and upturned forms, and the cake tower ing in solemn grandeur at the end of the room. I believe he manfully intended to do his duty, if no one else did, and finish that ceremony to the bitter end; but to read that exhortation at one poor woman left all alone would have been, to say the least of it, personal; so he gave ib up and shook hands, as is the practice of clergy 

 men. 

 " I�I wish you every happiness. Mrs. Hush ton," he stammered; then, remembering that I had just been unceremoniously deserted by my bridegroom, and not being sure whether such was the custom of the country or not, he mut tered something about" sympathy;" and then, 

 fathering his wits together by a violent effort, 

 e buret out, like Mr. Winkle�"Where are � 

 they ? What is the meaning of this most mde- - 

 coreus behaviour';" 

 I did not answer, but ran to the door to look 

 out. 

 "What does this mean?" ho repeated, fol lowing me. 

 "Can't you see?' Can't you smell?" I an swered, impatiently. " It is a bush fire." 

 The head station was built in a valley at the foot of a range of hills that formed a sort of semi-circle behind it. They were thickly wooded with stringybark, and covered with fern and grasstrees, and from among them there now rose, through air already quivering with heat, a column of thick white smoke, that floated upwards in billowy clouds. The fire was near�that one could tell by the smell of burning gum leaves; and though it could not have been burning long it promised to be a large fire, and a fierce one, for, as we watohed,. puns of reddish-brown rose before the white smoke, showing that the flames were getting 

 stronger. 

 ' The first set of men had disappeared over the ridge already; but Jaok and his friends were only half-way up, and had stopped to cut boughs from some young saplings. They looked back, and I snatched off my veil and waved it to Jack; they returned the salute with a flourish of their branches, and then re sumed their climb, while I twisted that unfor tunate veil into a turban and went to the house with the bewildered parson. 

 We found Mr. Green giving orders for the boughs with which the verandah-posts were decorated in honour of Christmas to be pulled down and all inflammable things to be put 

 away 

 "Will the fire come here?" asked the Rev. Augustus Smith anxiously. 

 "Not if we can help it," said Mr. Green; " but it will be hard work stopping it on a day like this, and it is well to be ready." 

 " If the fire don't come the sparks will," said Biddy, whose experience of bush fires was ex tensive ; " and them branches is just the things to ketch." 

 "Yes; get them down at once," said Mr. Green, and he hurried off, calling back to his wife, " Send up some tea to the men as soon as you can." 

 I went to my room to change mv dress, and ? there on the bed was my habit laid out for my 

 homeward ride with Jack. "Dear me! how differently the day was turning out from what ? wo expected, ";I thought. If it had not been 

 . for that fire I would have been putting on my 

 habit instead of this print morning dress. No. On second thoughts I decided things had hap pened so fast that, supposing the ceremony to nave been finished properly, we would just have sat down to brealcfast, and I would be cutting the cake; instead of which I went to the kitchen and cut large hunks of bread with 

 cheese to match. 

 It really was a disappointing wedding day. What was the good of getting married only to lose sight of my bridegroom at once, and have to work away as if nothing had happened? And Jack, poor fellow, what a day he must be having, hard at work in the heat and dust and smoke. I felt half inclined to give in and have a real good cry; but laughed instead, for through the window I saw the Rev. Augustus working hard, under Biddy's directions, taking ?down and carrying away the decorations put up with so much care an hour or so before. 

 Mrs. Green and I set to work at onco on woman's work in time of fire�boiling kettles and getting tea and provisions ready for the men�no light task in this instance, for there were thirty or forty men, and no other station near enough to share in the providing. When the first batch was ready it was taken up the hill by two 

 of the men's wives. 

 Mr. Smith and I next busied ourselves in taking out and filling all the tubs in the estab lishment, and in them bags and branches to be used in beating, should the fire come near the house. 

 We paused, Mr. Smith and I, when we had done all we could, and, gazing upwards, won 

 dered what it must feed like to be before that awful fire. Even where we were the air qui vered and danced with the heat and smoke, and the baked earth almost hurt our feet. What must it be up there ? we wondered. The wind had strengthened, driving the smoke across the sky; and the sunlight coming through it shed a lurid yellow glare on aU 

 around. Behind the hill the smoke rose thicker, faster, and darker, and the deep sullen roar of the fire could be heard. As we watched 

 a figure appeared on the top of the hill, then another, ana another, till quite a dozen were in sight. I could just make out Mr. Green with Jack and his friends beside him. They seemed to be consulting about something. More men kept coming up by twos and threes, dragging or carrying scorched branches; some flung themselves down in the nearest shade with the characteristic impulse of old hands at bush fires to take a rest when they could get it. The rest stood or lolled in groups, evidently waiting for orders. At last the Counoil of War on the hilltop came to an end; Mr. Green 

 pointed along the ridge and shook hands with 

 Jack, who with ten or a dozen men started off in the direction indicated. 

 Wo had not noticed�or at least I had not, for of course I had eyes for no one else while Jack was in sight�that all this time the two women had been scrambling down the hill, ac companied by a man, who turned off to the stables, while the women came down to the house, whither we followed. 

 "Mr. Green says will you give Jackson tea and tucker for ten men ; Mr. Rushton is going over to the big range," Mrs. Brown, one of the women, was saying as we come in. 

 We all fell to work at onoe. Mr. Smith cut 

 beef and sliced plum pudding, while _ Mrs. Green and I made substantial sandwiches; Biddy hurried up the kettles; and Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Jones packed things up as soon as they were ready. As we worked we asked brief questions, and got them answered still more briefly, with most aggravating interrup tions at interesting points. 

 " Is it a big fire? j 

 " Where were tliey when you got up?" 

 "Just coming off the steep range. They had stopped the lire all along, but it got into the stringybark and came along over their heads. Are these the bags, Mrs. Green ? Yes, they had to run. It got behind Mr. Rushton and a lot of 'em. Where do you keep the clean towels ?" 

 Imagine my feelings when at this point she dived nead first into a cupboard and became deaf to questions. I can see it now, that country kitchen, fresh whitewashed in honour of Christmas, with a bunch of gum boughs hung from the ceiling by_ way of a fly-catcher. A good-sized room, with a roughly flagged floor, just now intolerably hot, for we had a roaring fire in the large fireplace, on which two large kettles and a fountain were singing and spluttering. The window-panes were hot to the touch; plates taken from the shelves were ready warmed, and the butter was a clear transparent oil. It certainly was warm work. 

 At the end of the long table stood Mr. Smith, just now with knife and fork suspended, as he gazed at Mrs. Brown, who was now in tent on sorting towels. 

 "But�but, Mrs. Brown" he gasped. 

 "What's that?" she said, emerging from the cupboard. 

 " How did they escape ?" 

 "Oh, they come through it, of course. Here's a towel to wrap that pudding in." 

 I suppose, if I had had time to think of it, I would have been wretched about Jack's dan ger. I was anxious as it was; but we were ail so busy that I had no time to fret; besides, I knew he was safe. If he had been killed or badly hurt nothing would have hindered Mrs. Brown from telling me every detail. 

 I suppose we all looked hot; but poor Mr. Smith was the picture of misery, as he stood in his hot black clothes slicing beef in a tem perature considerably above 100�. 

 "Why don't you take off your coat?"said Biddy, noticing his distress. 

 Poor little man; I believe he blushed furi ously, but can't be sure, for it was a simple im possibility for his face to get any redder than it already was. 

 "Do, Mr. Smith," said Mrs. Green. "I wouldn't work in a hot thing like that for any thing ; besides, it's real good cloth, and it's sure to. get spoilt. Here, Biddy, take Mr. Smith's coat, and hang it up somewhere out of the way." 

 "Looksharp, sir,"said.Biddy, holding out 

 1; " Pve 

 her hand; " Pve no time to lose." 

 So he had to give it up. And I think that after a while he was glad, though just at first he looked hotter and more uncomfortable than 

 ever. 

 When we had packed up the provisions and seen Jackson start we all went into the baok 

 verandah and looked upatthehill. The fire was nearer now, and the smoke was thicker; ashes and bits of burnt fern and gum leaves were falling all around; the sun shone hotter, and the parched air seemed to scorch one's face. On the hilltop the men were cutting down branches, and evidently getting ready for a struggle. 

 "They are going to burn a track," said Mrs. 

 Brown. "I expect they'd like their tucker 

 now; they Won t have time to eat when the fire comes." 

 " Where is it now ?" I asked. 

 "About half a mile off,' but it won't take long to come," said Mrs. Brown. 

 "But," said Mr. Smith, looking puzzled, 

 " why don't they extinguish it farther off ?" 

 *' Honnuea flioir noo'l " aaM T\\.Tt*a Rrrt 

 Because they can t," said Mrs. Brown. 

 " It's in a grass-tree gully. If they were fools enough to try to stand against it they would be shrivelled up like so much brown paper." And she went into the kitchen, where Mrs. Green and Biddy were already preparing more tea and provisions. 

 All this time I had been longing to hear more about Jack, but every one had been too busy to answer questions; now I tried again. 

 "What?" said Mrs. Brown. "Oh, Mr. Rushton ? He's not hurt; not that I know on, at least. Some one got his arm burnt, but I don't think it was him"�in an aggravatingly doubtful tone. "Mrs. Jones here saw it all; I only saw them afterwards. They did look like sweeps, and no mistake." 

 "I didn't see much," said Mrs. Jones modestly; "I only see half a dozen men beat ing like mad; and all at once the fire got into the trees and come along over their heads; and they never took no notice till the sparks and things had lighted the fern behind them. Where's the sugar, Mrs. Green ? Yes; they had to run for it, thoy did! But it was all so smoky you couldn't make out which was which. The fem was blazing, and the burning bark was coming down like rain. If it had been uphill they had to go, not down, they wouldn't have got away, 110, not one of 'em. Oh, no! Mr. Rushton isn't hurt: he's got his eyebrows singed, and lost the ends off his moustaches, that's all. My husband has lost half his beard, and got a hole the sizeof your twohandS in the back of his waistcoat."
