 RED DICK THE STOCKMAN. CHAPTER XIII.�SUPER-MUNDANE. 

 BY "BUSH NATURALIST." 

 According to Jack Ralsh, if the phantom stockman came at all it would be at half-past 12�the very time that Red Dick took his dis- 

 aatrous ride. It wanted still two hours of that time. As all the party were tired, I undertook to keep watch until midnight, and then I was to call up Mr. and Mrs. Thornley and the two stockmen. The cattle had been very quiet not a stir among them, except an odd outsider feeding for a few yards away from the mob, as is always the case. So my host and hostess, after thanking me for my help, wished me good-night, and, when shaking hands, gave me sly injunctions not to sleep during my watch, or I might miss seeing the ghost, which would be very provoking after hearing so much about it. It was not long before the sonorous sounds proceeding from their tent told that one, if not both, was oblivious to nil mundane affairs, and I knew that I was the only one left to keep guard over this crime-haunted spot. I doubt if I ever shall forget that night's lonely camp-watch on the little scrub-surrounded plain in Northern Queensland. It is a memory picture indelibly photographed upon my brain. As I rode slowly round the cattle, gently edging in some of those inveterate crawlers found in every mob that will feed out at night, no matter how good the grass travelled over the day previous, I naturally could not help thinking of my old .stockman lted Dick. I thought of the time when I had known him at his best, when he first came to the Gulf, and of my fancy thnt somewhere I had seen him before. Again, I wondered who lie was. That he was a man of education was certain. Then I thought of the last time that I had camped at this waterhole, when "I had seen such a glorious sunrise and such beautiful nature-pictures. Then came over me the remembrance of the orgy at the hotel, anil of that peculiar pro phetic vision in which T beheld, in some unex plainablc way, the burning of the hotel and the death of poor Dick, just as, I afterwards heard, they actually occurred. As to the ghost story, it did not trouble me in the least. I had never been frightened of Dick when in the flesh, so I could see no reason to fear him if he came in the shadowy form of a ghost. The cattle, too, were not mine ; and although I should have been sorry to sec a smash among them, as, if they were scattered, it would entail a good deal of extra work through their boxing with the station herds, yet no loss would ensue to me; and, however selfish it may be, such is a vcrv comforting re flection when danger is impending. The night was moonlight, hut cloudy at times. The thunder-clouds seemed coining up again. Sometimes the whole plain and the cattle were clearly to be seen, then again the darkneas 

 would be almost as great as if there had been no moon shining at all. The time passed very very slowly. Again and again I looked at my watch, then I would quietly ride round the cattle, back again to the tents, and then another look at the watch. I almost wished that Dick really would appear, or anything�whether natural or supernatural�happen to break the monotony of the night. It wanted a quarter to 12. I got very sleepy, and so thought that to keep myself awake I would ride up to the spot where the old hotel had stood. I went, and as I paused and gazed at the ruins a strange nervous shiver passed through me, from the crown of my head even to the soles of my feet. I was astonished, for I was not at all frightened, therefore it could not possibly bo caused by fear. In after years I experienced the same peculiar influence when attending a so-called spiritualistic seance in Brisbane. The only signs of the one-time noisy Dead Finish hotel were the corner-post of the veranda and a grass-covered mound denoting where the chimney had fallen, the charred remnants of which had caused a luxuriant growth of grass. But of the stockyard, which nad escaped the general fire, many of the posts were still stand ing, and at one end there yet remained the slaughtering gallows upon which I had seen that ominous crow. It almost seemed as if a higher power had ordained that this terrible emblem of the death penalty should for ever remain here as a fitting monument to represent the hellish scenes that had desecrated this fair spot, for the cross-beam still rested upon the forked uprights, and still there dangled from it the hide-rope, now so shrivelled and twisted by exposure that the loose end turned up seemingly into the form of a noose out of which the rotting victim apparently had dropped. A scene which not very long ago was common even in Britain! As I sat upon my horse, at this midnight hour, and through some morbid unhealthy feeling gazed at this decaying gibbet, I heard a slight rustling sound, and felt that something most unmistakably yet invisibly had passed by me. I was unable to check the shudder that came over me, an unusual nervous fear, which even the "hoot hoot," "hoot hoot," coming from the direction of the gallows, upon which I could see between me and the moon was perched the unshapely form of the large boo book owl, was unable to drive from me. I looked at this ungainly bird, and wondered if it also was ominous of woe, that it should choose exactly the midnight hour to perch upon such a place. My naturalist's knowledge told me no ! That in all probability this bird perched upon this bare pole because it was a convenient look-out from which to pounce upon some unwary rat in the grass beneath. Yet so strong a hold does morbid imagination gain upon the physical side of man that it really required an effort of mind before I felt that reason and common sense had mastered the superstitious, aided as this latter was by such favourable cir cumstances. Riding back again to the tents I called up Mr. Thornley. On ray telling him how quiet the cattle had been, he remarked that it was unnecessary to call any of the rest of the party. " Let the poor fellows sleep while they can, for they are tired enough without rousing them up to watch for an imaginary ghost, and they will have a hard day of it to-morrow. I only hope Jack Ralsh will be back in time to let us get an early start." " I shall watch with you until alter the fatal time, which is now indeed close at hand," I said, "so I think you are quite right to let the men sleep it out." " And I intend to watch too," said Mrs. Thornley, as she quietly came up behind us. " Helen, my dear, you would be far better in the tent. What on earth makes you get up ? You surely are not really silly enough to believe in this apparition!" "No, Tom, certainly not. And I cannot explain why I want to Bit up and watch. Yet I have a strange feeling of coming danger, a pre sentiment of something terrible going to hap pen." " Fiddle-de-dee with your woman's presenti ments and nonsense! Don't let Jack Balsh's yarns overturn your usual common sense. Why Helen, dear," he continued, after having looked closely at his wife for a few moments, I never in the whole of our wedded life �aw you so nervous. You arc actually trembling. Are you not well, Nellie ?" and as he callea her by the pet name of bygone days he put his arm around her waist to support her, and kissed her, for their marriage haa been a happy one. " Thank you, Tom, for that kiss. I do not feel at all well. I can't control this trem bling, and oh ! I have had such a horrid dream. I again saw that ugly old gipsy queen; the same I saw in Yorkshire when I was a girl, and whom I dreamed that I saw the night that baby died, and again she pointed her finger at me, and she said�said�" <7What, dearest?" "That the time of the fulfilment of her pro phecy had come!" Just at that moment the wretched wail of a dingo broke the stillness of the night, and was three times repeated from the direction of the old hotel. "My1 dear, dear wife, you must not think of such foolish things as nightmare dreams. These abominable dingoes are enough to make anyone nervous. Come back to the tent, dearest, and get a glass of wine." And he was gently leading her away, when I touched him upon the shoulder, and pointing towards the ruins of the old shanty, whispered the one word -"Look!" The earnest tone of my voice arrested him. He turned, and so did Helen. The moon was shining brightly and fair on to the spot where the hotel had stood. There was no shade, nothing to confuse our view. All was as clear and distinct as our bright Australian moon can make things. To our unspeakable astonishment there was to be clearly seen in this bright moonlight a horse, apparently hitcliod by tuc bridle to the one remaining veranda post of the old Dead Finish hotel. " This coincidence is extraordinary," said the squatter ; " but it must be some one travel ling up from the Lower Flinders, and who wisely prefers these cool fine nights to the hpat of the day. Ah! there he is by the side of his horse. By heaven!" he continued, "he is hatless!" And, to our utter dismay, and even horror, this man hastily seized hold of the bridle and climbed, or rather scrambled, into the saddle. We now gazed in amazement. Again I felt that strange cold chill run through mo from head to foot. I glanced at Mr. Thornley. His face expressed unmistakable incredulous astonishment ?-complete dumbfounded surprise. Not a trace of fear, but such surprise as only the confirmed materialist can feel when he is actually brought face to face with the super* 

 mundane. Poor Mrs. Thornley was holding tightly to her husband's arm; her face was pale as death, yet she gazed at the newly appeared horseman as does the trembling bird when under the fatal fascination of the rattle snake. For a moment or two the rider seemed unable to get his proper seat. He reeled to and fro in the saddlo as does a drunken roan. Then we observed him dig his spill's into the Hanks of the horse, thus causing the animal to dart off at racing speed. Then there arose from this ghostly rider such a wild maniacal cry a* only the madness of drink can evoke. On towards us came this phantom horse and this ghostly horseman, and, as he swerved away towards the cattle, I whispered: " It is Red Dick, most undoubtedly!" Onward galloped the phantom � straight towards the main mob, into the midst of them. We heard the sharp crack of a ghostly whip, and another wild nulloo from the maniac; then there was a sound as of a trampling army or of rolling thunder, for the cattle, with one impulse, had sprung to their feet and�were gone! Still onward round the plain rode the ghostly stockman, now cracking his whip, now hullooing as if to check some cattle. He turned at the end; then back by the water's edge, making direct for the big gum-tree by the tents. Then, in attempting to pass under its drooping branches, as did Red Dick of old, he struck against a limb, reeled from his horse, apparently fell to the ground close beside the now terrified group of spectators, and dis appeared. Alt was Richard Wynn!" shrieked Helen, and she fell senseless into the arms of her husband. 

 Chapter XIV. CONCLUSION. The scene now was one beyond my power to describe. The men had all jumped up; dismay and terror even were depicted on every counte nance. Fear was the dominant feeling. Strong men though they were, they actually trembled with nervousness. Of all terrors those whose cause is unknown are the most terrible. The horses that had been kept ready saddled, my own among the number, had broken their bridles and galloped madly away. Not a hoof of cattle was to be seen, and the master himself was heedless of anything but the form of his toor senseless wife, by whose side he was now neeling, uncertain indeed whether the thread of life had not been snapped asunder by such an unwonted strain. After a short time, however, the stockman instincts returned, and the thought was of the cattle. Where had they gone? Seeing their master beside himself with grief the men turned to me for orders. "There is nothing for it but to wait till day light," I said. " The cattle are by now miles away and split up beyond the possibility of col lecting. Jack Ralsh will be here in three hours or so, and he will then find us a horse or two. You will all have to come back to the station and camp there until the wet season is over. It will take weeks to collect the cattle again even if the wet does not set in immediately. If it does, you will never get 100 of them." To the uninitiated it may seem strange that such a large mob of cattle can be so utterly lost, but such a thing is quite possible in an unfenced, indeed unoccupied, country. Again, those readers who have never seen a cattle "smash," as in bush parlance anything that causes a sudden break-up of a droving mob is called, can form no idea of the results of a sudden and universal panic through the herd. It is with them as with people in a theatre on tire, when terror usurps all controlling power; each individual strives to get away, anyway, anyhow. The terrific force of the first rush of 1500 cattle when panic-struck is something tremendous. I have seen the whole side of a new strong stockyard thus completely levelled to the ground. In that case many were killed and more injured. It was certain that scores of Mr. Thornley's cattle would be killed and maimed by coming in contact with the sharp jagged ends of the Drigalow and gidia. It was lucky that the cattle had rushed from the direction of the camp tents and not towards them, otherwise nothing could have saved the entire party from being trampled under foot by this living avalanche. "But what about poor Mrs. Thornley?" I think I hear my fair readers exclaim. " Did that terrible prophecy really come true ? You surely cannot expect anyone to believe such rubbish as that?" Well, well! The idea of calling an occur rence rubbish just because it did not happen to you! But things were not quite so bad with Mrs. Thornley as that. Again would I remind you that prophecies by no means invariably come true even when uttered by queen gipsies. If you remember, the terrible words of the gipsy to the poor girl at the stile under the elm trees of Silcoates were to the effect "that through Richard Wynn�although after his death�Helen would lose wealth, husband, children, and be mad until death." Well, nothing of the sort occurred. Mr. Thornley did not die; children they had lost, but only by ordinary disease ; wealth they certainly did lose by this smash in the cattle ; and although such a frightful night had its effects upon the mind of Mrs. Thornley for a long time, causing excessive nervousness and timidity, yet upon returning�after being my guest during the wet season�to Victoria and civilised life, time caused the wound to heal. My story is ended, now that I have told of one of those strange events of my life which have led to my belief in the super-mundane existence of mankind. Upon my tolling this history of Red Dick to others I have dis covered that to many�although it has been told to me as a secret not to be made known on any pretence�there havo happened strange things all pointing to the same possibility of existence after death, and to the occasional return of the spirit to earth, more particularly when death had snsued through violence. It only remains for me to vindicate the character of Jack Ralsh. When he returned and found that the smash had actually occurred he absolutely refused the �200 bonus, and returned the cheque to the squatter, saying, " I am not the man to take a mean advantage of any man. Moreover, lam going to stop and help you to collect the cattle, for no one knows the Gulf country as I do. We'll get a lot of them yet. Never fear." Mr. Thornley had only just time to fix his camp snugly at the home-station before the wet season set in in earnest. After the rains, by dint of hard and arduous riding, 500 head were collected. With these Jack Ralsh started, took them safely through the fifty-mile scrub, and got the Leichhardt blocks after all, for it 

 turned out that the Diaraantina mob of cattle had crossed on to the Gregory Biver. From the time of his recognition by his old sweetheart the phantom stockman was no more known to haunt the Dead Finish plain. A bush fire swept away the solitary veranda post and the ominoun gibbet. Nature resumed her sway. Bit by bit the grasses grew, the shrubs blossomed, the birds returned, the sun shone, and the spot again became fair and pleasant to the eye. Not one trace remained to tell of the hellish scenes, of the human demons, of the foul degradation it had gone through. Peace and beauty reigned. Verily do I believe that such will bo the case over the whole ol: this earth's surface when man asserts his manhood, and banishes that raan-varopire alcohol from his domain! [the end.]
