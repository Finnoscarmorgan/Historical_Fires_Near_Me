He had been brought I up.in .the lap of luxury, had received a'l military education which was useless in I anything , but military appointment". I Secretaryships, and other ships 'of I the clerical [order were difficult to be ob-1 tained. As elsewhere, when offices of I this kind , were vacant there were a I hundred applicants trying to get them, I and of the; applicants numerous were the I applications from young Englishmen, who! hadgonetb the colony to better them-1 solves,, with but a sous in many bases to j help themselves, trusting mostly lo interest j their letters of introduction to colonial I firms likely to'be of use. Herbert' Anno- j loye could not be ranked amongst Ibis J impecunious class; for he hod money�his I mother�s money;�not a largo sum�-only a I very few thousand�but ample to further j his intentions.

Five yearn had posted,over their heads and threesmaljpledgeaofaffection had been added to their happy lot. Since then Herbert Annelaye, had made . a good round sum .by selling his share to his partner. ? , i �They were now to start for. England at last, after the delay caused by a| dangerous , illness to Mr. . Annelaye, typhoid fever, of a serious, kind, which had prostrated him to such a degree tho doc- 1 tors feared the effects of the voyage and English climate upon him.

The scrutiny was evidently . satisfactory. Puck volunteered a kiss, putting his arms round Aunt Connie�s neck. �My, darlings,� she said, kissing the little ones all round, and taking (he baby girl in her arms. �Aunty has tea and cakes all ready for you; dear little mother must -He down and rest a wee after such a long day.� �What a fairy palace,� said Vera, as she entered ; the little �Nest � and ad mired everything from tho cool looking fern leaves; chintz covered furniture, to the dainty, little tea service and basket of. freshly gathered strawberries. �No thank you, dear� (in answer to a question from Connie); �Thanks, to your dear husband wo had a'substantial -meal at Albury, winding up with tho most deliciously cool molonas cold-as ico.� , �Ah, that�s Norman�s doing,� said Mrs. Fortescue.. �Icq is not to bo had, in Albury yot, so Normnn always has tho frait.ond. wine put in the tank until it is wanted; I declared hiimst�-bo iced: the first time wo lunched at the hotel.� .. �Cflpio along, Annelaye; the girls are dying to have a �talkoe talkee.� WoM leave them�come, we.are pot wanted.� Annelaye jumped up beside his friend, and they drove up �to s the house to gether. ) - ? �There is i nothing Jike a warm bath; some iced B. and S., and then a .good smoke, for setting a man,up,after. v a hot journey.� i, � �Wo, jhavo a first rate bath room, with plenty of water.
