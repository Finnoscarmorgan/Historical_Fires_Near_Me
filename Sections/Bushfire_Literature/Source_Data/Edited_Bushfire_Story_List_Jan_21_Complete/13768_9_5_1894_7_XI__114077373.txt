CHAPTER XL � (Continued;) This trial had excited great sensation, 3ie chamber of justice -was literally packed I from floor to ceiling 'with human heads ; j not one square inch, of the room 'but what was utilised, and human eyes � sympathetic, awestruck, eager, curious, and. hungry, ex cited eyes gazed from every corner of the spacious 'building on the central figure, who stood there throughout the whole of the im pressive ceremony, which, beginning with a serious adjuration, had lapsed into a solemn chant. Indeed, to those around, John Fane might have been in the next world, which they felt sure the jury were about to place I him, but for his physical presence there. I When the sing-song voice of the clerk of the court had died away, Mr. Warden � who TTould certainly claim the respect of iihose around Viim^ if not *by fri' manner, it was by bis burly appearance, his thoughtful face 

 and deep bass voice, that drowned any other aoise in the court � rose from his place. With one hand resting on. the table, the. other in his trousers pocket, he began to harangue the jury upon the. case now before the court, speaking in the measured tones of ordinary conversation. The Attorney-General in. opening the case to the jury occupied about three hours. He began thus : � ' May it please your lordship and gentle men of the jury : This- is no ordinary case of murder you are sworn to try. , There is no question here as to degrees of crime. It is not a case in which mercy is likely, to be extended ; it is essentially a question of murder, and it is your duty to inquire into it � a duty which. is cast upon you by the obligations of the oatt^you have taken. I have a painful duty to :',?i^f orm, and I trust I may perform it withoiTtvtmdue severity or harshness. Unhappily, the evidence that I shall call against the prisoner is only too clear. Some of you, perhaps, have heard him spoken of as being a man of great generosity and kind deeds amongst his tenants and villagers of Faversham ; but this is not a matter of sentiment, it is a matter of justice, and justice must be done. After stating the nature of the charge ? against the prisoner, he proceeded to give an outline of the evidence he was about to pro duce.- It appeared that Isba Fane, wife of the accused, met her death on the evening of October 10. She was a woman of great attractions, and a foreigner. It was never ksi&wn when or -where the accused met his wife. All that is known was that during bis two years' absence on the continent, pre vious to the death of his father, he met and married her -without the knowledge of the. late Squire Fane. On this subject both the deceased and accused were very , reserved. According to the evidence to be taken from several witnesses, the young squire and his wife lived, until the past two years, without a domestic trouble or quarrel between them. They were known through out . Faversham for their great hospitality, and were much respected by their tenants and other villagers for their charity and goodness to the neighboring poor. The deceased was not liked generally in Faver sham, and in some instances she caused much talk by her manner of behavior with, some of the gentlemen. The accused was very popular with all classes. He was never known to show any jealousy towards the de ceased until the last two years, and the de ceased, as will be shown in evidence , had given him good cause for such jealousy. This jealousy was no doubt the motive of the accused for the murder. It was true that the evidence brought against the prisoner would be purely circumstantial ; but the circumstances were clear and cogent, and no single link would be missing. For the past two years there- was known to be many quarrels between the deceased and the accused ; and on October 10 last, after one of these quarrels, Mrs. Fane disappeared Snd was never seen or -.beard of until a few weeks back, when her body was discovered by Detective Dare in a tomb on a piece of ground known as the Ruins, belonging .to the accused. The Attorney-General asked to be allowed to call the particular atten lon of the jury to the fact that the accused -iione held the key to that piece of ground and carried it on his person. The Ruins, as it is called, was an ancient burial-place once belonging to the nuns of Davington Hill, and many of the headstones and tombs are still there. The inedical evidence could not agree as to the direct cause of death, owing to the decomposed state of the body when found, but one thing was certain, the body was put there, as it was found -face downwards and the slab of the tomb 'yras carefully replaced. At lite inquest the body had been recognised as that of Mrs. Fane, of Faversham Hall, by several persons who knew the deceased well, and by the accused, who when confronted with the body could not deny its identification. He also by his manner on this occasion had strengthened the case against himself. Major' Thorn, a well-known gentleman residing in the dis trict of Davington, and Patrick Cleary, game keeper' thte accused, will by_ their evidence prove that Squire Fane was fully aware of the fact that the top of the tomb was loose and had known it to be in that condition ever since he had been master of the Hall Mr. Warden went on to state that -the ,dd-s meanor of the accused, which would be shown by the evidence of his valet, William 

 Brown, and Deborah Watson, when told of Mrs. Fane's absence, was as of one fully aware .of the fact, that he knew his wife had gone and -where she had gone. He (the Attorney-General) wished the gentlemen of the jury to look at the probabilities as to how and when the murder had been com mitted. It was evident that the accused and deceased bad quarrelled over a gentle man-named Sir Francis Panton, in -whose company the deceased was very often eeen, this causing much gossip in the town of Faversham. The accused having heard his wife's name spoken of too freely in con junction with Sir Francis Panton, spoke to her about it, and she resented it. The temper of the accused is known to be very violent when once aroused, as on this occa sion. Now, his suspicions having been awakened, he was seen to watch his wife for the greater part of the ^evening of October 10 ; and when she went out it was supposed he followed her, and must have met her near the Ruins. Overcome with rage and jealousy, he killed hex and placed her body in the tomb. The witness Kate Rowe, a gipsy, will prove that she saw a gentleman and lady near the Ruins on that night, the gentleman bearing much resem blance to the accused. , The first witness the Attorney-General would call would be one of considerable importance, William Brown, valet to the accused, who would testify as to how he found the accused on the morning following the murder, his strange manner and bearing, his boots stained with red soil � in Faversham this soil is only found on the road leading to the Ruins. He will also testify that the accused had not slept in his bed that night, and had not changed his evening clothes j and on the evening of the same day, when the witness went to put out the evening clothes for the accused, the coat was miss ing. The proof is clear that the murder was committed by the prisoner. This coat i (holding up a dress coat much crushed and stained) was found, after the arrest of the prisoner, - .stowed away in a box belonging to the deceased, by Detective Dare, in the presence of his valet, and acknowledged at the time as the lost coat belonging to his master. The stains on the coat had been examined and found to be those of human blood. There were witnesses to prove that the accused wished the disappearance of his wife kept as quiet as possible, under the circumstances, by *'� offering bribes, which would be proved in the instance of Farmer Butts when the diamond brooch belonging to the Fane set was found, -which was sup posed to have been worn by the deceased on the night of the murder. The accused never exerted himself in any way to find out what had become of his wife ; in fact 'his manner, nervousness, and irritability since October 10 last were against him. The whole of the Attorney-General's speech was unimpassioned and judicial. It was very earnest, Was marked by cogency and closeness of reasoning, and was full of hard destructive facts. He begged the jury to dismiss all sentiment, and appealed strongly to their reason. No fact that could be brought to view was missed, and no symptom was given of a desire to distort ?evidence. The first day of the trial was occupied by the Attorney-General's address, and by a brief examination of one or two unimportant witnesses. So far, the proceedings apparently made little impression upon John Fane, for beyond every now and then lifting his eyelids he made no sign. The jury, composed of 12 quiet-looking men, drawn from agricultural scenes, clearly took the profoundest interest in the pro ceedings. Some of them from time to time jotted down notes. CHAPTER XH. The Trial (Continued). �The second day of -the trial of John Fane began in real earnest,- and the difficulty of the Attorney-General's taskbecame apparent. When the Court had become seated, Mr. Warden once again arose from his place at the lawyer's table, took a scrutinising survey first of the judge, then of the jury : coughed slightly, and called William Brown. As the Clerk of the Court ' took up the name, John Fane's valet, a clean-shaven rnqn of short stature, came forward, entered the witness-box in a very unwilling manner,' and looked at the Attorney-General with a scowl upon his face. The oath having been administered, and when Mr. Warden had given the man an opportunity to pull himself together, he said � ' What is your- name ?' � r� William Brown.' 'Tour occupation?' 'Valet.' � To whom?' ' To Squire Vane:' ' How long have jaa been in his employ?' ' For the past six years.' ' Can you tell me how long . you have known the deceased f* � As long as I have been with. Squire Fane.' - ** Will you answer my 'question f' 'I have already done so,' growled Brown. 'Then you did sot know joax master 

 before he married the deceased ?' asked the Judge. a No, me Lord.' 'Were your master and mistress on amiable terms towards each other?' con tinued the Attorney-GeneraL ' No.' ' Then they quarrelled?' � They did.' 'Can you tell me what they quarrelled about ?' 'I don't knowj I am not given to listening. ' Well, you are an exception, to the rule. Of course they quarrelled, most married people quarrel. Can you remember the night your mistress disappeared there was a quarrel � .what was it about ?' ' The Squire objected to his wife spend ing so much time, with a gentleman, and madam said she would do as she pleased.' j 'Do you remember the name of tfjJr gentleman ?' 'I can't say I do.' ' Did your master use threatening words on this occasion ?' ' No sir, he only said he -would rather kill her at once than she should carry on so.' There was a smile of satisfaction on the face of the Attorney-General at this state | ment. } 'Tour master quarrelled with his wife 

 j over a gentleman named Sir Francis Panton.' Now, could you tell me if this gentleman -was in Faversham at the time the last quarrel took place ?' ' No, sir ; he left a fortnight before the other guests of the Hall.' ' Do you know why ?' ?f I heard him tell master he was obliged to go back to Paris on business, and -would not return to England for some time.' ' That is all right. Now tell me, was it true your late mistress was known to make clandestine interviews with this gen tleman P' ' I can't say.' ' Did you ever meet her slipping out to the shrubbery after dinner P* ' I object to these questions being asked ; I do not see what reference they have to the case,' said Mr. Redburn, rising. But, , after much wrangling and the citation of numberless authorities, after the inter change of many sharp civilities and con temptuous smiles, the question was allowed, and the Attorney-General continued. ' Answer my question,' he said, addressing Brown. ' I can't remember I did, sir.' ' You were valet to the accused, and you would be able to recognise the coat that -was lost on October 10 last when you saw it. j Now, could you tell me if this is it ?' said the Attorney-General, holding up a coat. ' Pass it up to the witness,' he continued. 

 ' Do you recognise that now ?' ' Yes, sir, that belongs to the master.' ' When did he wear it last?' ' It may be he -wore it on October 10 last.' 'Why October 10?' ' Because he never -wore his evening suits since V-ip wife -went away.' ' I believe you were with Detective Dare | when this coat -was found?' ' I was, sir.' 'Do you recognise this?' said the Attorney-General, holding up a small blood stained handkerchief with lace around it. 'I do not,' answered Brown with emphasis. ' You don't recognise it as your mistress'.' ' I never had anything to do with my mistress's clothes,' replied Brown with much dignity. There was much laughter, as the face of the witness at that moment was a study of disgust, and the answer caused Mr. Warden to look rather silly. ' What time did you see your master last on the evening your mistresB left f' ' I can't say.' ' Was it before 10 o'clock ?' 'i never saw him after 8 o'clock that evening.' 'Tell me -what was the appearance of your master when you saw him the next morning in the library ?' ' He was asleep, and looked very tired, as if he had 'been up all night.' ' Did you notice anything particular about his dress ?' 'He was wearing hiB evening clothes, and he looked as if he had been tossing about a good deal j his clothes were much crushed.' ? ?? ' ? ' Had he the appearance of having been outf' ' Yes, sir ; his boots were all stained with the red clay found on the road leading to the Ruins.' ' Was he in the habit of taking walks before he retired for the night ?' *' Sometimes, not very often.' 'Where was your piaster at 11 o'clock ?that evening ?' ' In bed, I suppose.' (Laughter.) - ?' But you told me he had not slept in his bed that night. Do you not always attend to your master the last thing at night?' . 'I never -waited later than 10 o'clock.' .� You told me the evening of the final quarrel between your master and mistress that he followed her out very angry ?' (to be co.ntuiu.ud.)
