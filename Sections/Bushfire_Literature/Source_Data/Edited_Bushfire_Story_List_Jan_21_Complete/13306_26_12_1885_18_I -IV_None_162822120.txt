Jenny. 

 A STORY OF THE NORTH QUEENSLAND PLANTATIONS. 

 By Edward Bevan. 

 Chapter I. 

 The heat was intense � a something almost tangible in its weight and oppressiveness. The blue-green cane-leaves drooped as if totally overcome, and in the distance the heat arose shimmering from the ground, forming a haze like the smoke of a bush fire. Scarcely a sound was to be heard but the never-ceasing creak of the cicadas, and now and then the 

 distant chatter of the South Sea Islanders working in the canefields, occasionally broken by the weird solo of one more excited than the rest, whose voice would rise distinct in a not inharmonious yell that made the little lizards come with quick rushes through the dead cane leaves and listen intently. Yet the scene was a beautiful one in spite of the heat, and one might with but a little stretch of imagination fancy oneself in the " Sunny South," " 'way down upon de ole plantation," instead of being blistered with the sun of North Queensland. Taste and capital can do much to beautify a country, and both came to North Queensland when the planters broke the greenhide squatter era, and gave a distinct and special tone to Northern society. They came of a moneyed race, who, for generations back, had been accustomed to luxury� whose ancestors, some of them, perhaps, had first established the semi-regal plantation life of the old times in the Southern States. Most of them were men of taste and no little culture, who looked with considerable disfavour upon the idea of "roughing it " when the climate demanded imperatively that one should live comfortably, if not luxuriously. Mr. Sinclair at least was a most sincere believer in the luxuries of this life, and, like Oliver Wendell Holmes, would for them have willingly dispensed with the necessities. He had sent an experienced overseer on some eighteen months before he thought of setting out from England, in order to "form " the plantation, with orders to erect a house, the plans of which for coolness and shade were a delicious dream. The overseer, hard practical man of business that he was, had the house erected on the rising ground towards the back of the estate. But once finished, his instructions ended; so that when Mr. Sinclair arrived the house was there, but it stood in a wilderness. The truth must be told that, when Mrs. Sinclair and her daughter Jenny first inspected the premises, they looked so miserably deserted that the two retired to that portion sacred to themselves and wept bitterly. Jenny was the first to recover and to console her mother. "They say that anything will grow in this climate, mother, and you'll see how beautiful we will make it. Look what a splendid terrace we can get out there� what a lovely view of the estate, with a setting of feathery palm trees," she said. So these two women set themselves to plan and arrange until the bare house became, in their imaginations, a palace in Utopia. Jenny was right in her estimate of how pretty they could make their home look. Now, the house, with its white roof of iron, its deep cool verandahs, with masses of purple bouganvillea blossom protecting them from the search- ing sunbeams, nestled, comfortably amidst a garden ablaze with tropical flowers, whilst behind it a patch of dark-green scrub, with creepers falling from the topmost boughs of giant cedars, and twisting and twining in every conceiv- able manner, afforded a dark background that showed in splendid contrast to the vivid colouring of the foreground. The garden in front was laid out with great taste. In front of the house was a trim and spacious lawn covered with a thick carpet of buffalo grass, and edged with beds containing plants that one can only find in hothouses in England, the view behind them being confined by thick- foliaged bananas and plants of variegated grasses. This on two sides. On the third� the terrace to which Jenny had directed her mother's attention on the day they arrived� the view was beautiful in the extreme. Beds of scarlet geranium bordered its edge, and on either side was a group of palms, with their beautiful feathery leaves. From the centre a flight of steps led down to the lower level and to the edge of a lagoon covered with sweet-scented purple lilies. Beyond this lay the fields of waving green cane leaves, the roofs of the mill buildings showing themselves away in the distance. Beyond these, again, was the dark foliage which grew upon the river bank, which shut out further view until the eye rested upon the distant blue of the coast range. Such was the house at Magnolia. And one of its occu- pants at least was in keeping with her surroundings. Miss Jenny Sinclair was belle of the district. She had arrived at Magnolia at the gauche age of "sweet seventeen," and since then had blossomed into the sweetest flower of woman- hood to be found in North Queensland. At least so said every male for a hundred miles round between the ages of seventeen and fifty. She had light brown hair, curling in masses over her forehead, in the shadow of which lay two bewitching gray eyes, fringed with long curling lashes. Her features were regular enough, without being of too rigid an outline, but her sweetest feature was that tiny rosebud of a mouth, so sensitive, so lovable that it actually gave character to her whole face. Her expression was womanly in the extreme� womanly in the trustful glance of her bright eyes, womanly in the pure, peaceful happiness of her whole face. To be in her presence was like receiving a moral douche ; one felt spiritually refreshed ; one's opinion of womankind rose a hundred per cent.; and if the consequences were not connected with a fluttering under- neath one's watchpocket, one's most pleasurable recollections would be of sweet-faced Jenny Sinclair. White was her favourite colour, and nearly every day saw her dressed in spotless raiment. Now and then, as if to aggravate her admirers, she would place some little 

 spray of brilliant blossom in her hair, or would bestow it where it would nestle against her neck. Ah, those lucky flowers! She was a little girl � the little women have moved the world � but, if she were small, she was "pure grit." There were two people that Jenny loved dearly � her father and her mother ; and to see Jenny run up, throw her arms round the former's neck and kiss him, was enough to make an iceberg jealous. Mr. Sinclair had been an army man, and one could even, now trace his military education in his erect bearing and in the manner in which he treated his inferiors in the social scale. Jenny's mother was just another little Jenny grown old, with, the same sweet expression, some what saddened, for she had lost three children, and Jenny was the only one left ; and it seemed that all the love born with those lost three had rested on the last dear one left to her. It was a sad face, but it was the face of one softened by sadness � of one who had been refined by the fire of sorrow. * * * * * * * Down in the canefield the islanders were working in a row along the cane, cutting it for the crushing that was then just commencing. The sun was just setting, and was yet throwing its dying yet heated rays over the trees by the river, glancing on the bright cane-knives as they were wielded by the toiling niggers. Black figures clad in blue serge appeared and disappeared along the row of cane, and now and then one would burst into his native song, that sounded remarkably like a " yodel" out of tune. Carts laden with cane were grinding their way towards the mill in a long line, whilst others were being filled by parties of "boys," as the islanders were called, each trying to outdo the rest in the j amount he contributed. "Close up sun go down ; close up kai-kai" (food), were the expressions heard amongst them. They were happy-looking fellows enough, in spite of the so-called "slavery" to which they are subjected. When these boys arrived they were puny, miserable-looking articles of humanity that one could almost see through; now they ' were stout, burly men, well clad, evidently well fed and cared for, and, like other men that have good con- dition, cared to do as little work as they possibly could. They were merry as grigs, laughing, joking, and chaffing amongst themselves like schoolboy out for a holi- day. They were the happiest, fattest, most comfortable- looking lot of shiny-faced "slaves" that the eye could rest upon. Suddenly the distant bell that told of "knock-off" time came wafting along, and with shout and song they tucked their cane-knives under their arms, gathered their belongings in the shape of raiment together, and slouched along home to their grass houses. Behind them all, with hands plunged deep into the pockets of his snowy moleskin pants, walked Jack Dudley, his face sad, his eyes upon the ground in front of him, and the wail that kept time in his thoughts to his lingering footsteps was always the one thing � "I love her ! I love her ! Dearest and best, what can I do to win her ?" A soft felt hat with a very wide brim covered his head, and his curly brown locks emerged from under the front of it and fell negligently over his forehead. A complexion of a deep, brown, well-cut nose ; dark, expressive eyes ; a dark, drooping, silky moustache, covering a determined mouth and firm chin � such was the appearance of my hero Jack, at the time I write of. A white shirt open at the neck, the sleeves rolled up halfway to his elbow, snowy pants with felt and pouch ; blucher boots to terminate all� such was his attire. The dress of any working man, the unmistakable bearing of a gentleman. 'What can I do?' thought Jack. 'Here I am, an actual beggar in pocket and yet treated like a man with thousands. I came out free in mind and action. Now, as far as my mind goes, it is anchored once and forever in the j same spot. Its a case of the 'gallant captain's daughter,' and the overseer that 'didn't oughter.' Why in fortune's name did the governor bring me up and educate me as if I had thousands a year ? After all the good times I had in dear old England, times during which there was no whisper of having to work for one's living, hero I am cast anyhow into this country, where the gentleman is the man with money, and the owner of thousands is the aristocrat, although he may have no more breeding about him than Paddy's pig. And little Jenny? I'm no nearer gaining my darling than I was when I first saw her. It's pretty evident that staying on here at thirty shillings a week and found, will not do any- thing. They talk about black labour on plantation being slavery, but by the great Jove it's the white labour that is slave-driven. You've got to do something for your- self, Jack Dudley ! You've got to hit out and do some- thing to make money ! If you stick at this game for any length of time vou would lose your independence, although Sinclair � God bless him � treats you like, a son. Hullo! What the deuce is that?" A confused babel of islanders voices rose not fifty yards away � voices in savage anger, and amidst the row a voice yelling for " Missa Dudley." Jack burst through the cane just in time to see a huge Tonga Islander from an adjoining plantation deal one of his boys, who went by the sobriquet of "Black Beetle," a sickening blow with a club. Other Tonga boys were there, their heads decorated with plumes of cockatoo feathers, heavy bead necklaces round their necks and arms; their chests bare, the muscles standing out in bold relief, and on their legs and round their waists they wore a voluminous arrangement of Indian red cloth. In some cases their close curling hair had been limed � in a manner that it is whispered has been adopted by some fashionable ladies� and presented various shades, from light straw to a deep red-brown colour. These boys were "assisting" their compatriots by jumping round, yelling horribly, and administrating a lusty thump with their clubs whenever they saw a chance. All this presented itself to Jack's vision in an instant, and without the least hesitation - he plunged into the yelling group, dealing blows right and left. Three "boys" bit the dust in the first half minute, then Jack received a terrific blow on the leg that brought him to Mother Earth, but as he fell he managed to pick a club from the ground, that had fallen from the hands of one of the combatants, and with a sweep into which he put his best will he brought it into contact with his assailant's shins, in such a manner as to cause his complete discomfiture. How things might have fared with Jack it is hard to say, had not "Black Beetle" recovered somewhat, and "taken a hand," thumping a prostrate "boy" to his heart's content, dealing blows right and left, and yelling at the top of his voice � "You no more look out Mary belong 'o me," embellishing his abuse with coarse adjectives. Then two white men, who had been ploughing, made their appearance, and the Tonga "boys" took to their heels and fled. It was with considerable difficulty that Jack reached his hut, "Black Beetle" being most officious in offering his assistance, and evidently regarding Jack as the preserver of his life. On their arrival he retired to his hut, where, amidst an admiring crowd of his countrymen, he detailed with many a "My word !" and many a warlike wave of the club he still held, how he had worsted the enemy, how he had rescued ' Missa Dudley,' and in fact how he had beaten, and was still equal to the task of beating, the whole of the inhabitants of the Island of Tonga, past, present, and future. After considerable inquiries it was ascertained that a stalwart young Tongan had made advances, more or less successful, towards gaining the affections of "Black Beetle's" wife, or Mary, as they are all called, one of the consequences being the strife that had taken place, and which "Black Beetle " considered so final, that he subse- quently confided to Jack that "that fellar man Tonga no more look out Mary belong 'o me."  Chapter II Jenny was sad. There was something the matter with her that she herself could not analyse. Her feelings were in no way affected because she had refused young Edmond- stone, of the Alma plantation. Quite the contrary. She always thought that young gentleman a "silly donkey," and did not hesitate to express herself to that effect to her mother. Not for an instant did she consider that young Edmondstone was the wealthiest match in the district, own- ing one plantation, holding a large interest in another, and possessing a bank balance to which his bank manager bowed down and worshipped. Money was no consideration with Jenny. What she wanted in a husband was good breeding, manliness, gentleness, and courage; and yet it 

 seemed to her that, although there were plenty of nice fellows when she first met them, they all of them went the same way after a few months, and became what she was pleased to call "absurd." No, her feeling of depression was certainly not because of young Edmondstone. Nor was it because Jack Dudley was leaving � her father told them about it at lunch � and going goodness only knew where or when. Jack, indeed ! What was Jack to her ? Jack had never hung about her, agreeing with everything she said. On the contrary, he had expressed an opinion quite in opposition to hers on several occasions. He had never forgotten her bouquets; rather had he appeared quite annoyed even that others had. He had not annoyed her by always hanging about her. No, if any- thing, he had rather avoided her. And yet � and yet � there was something that she could read deep down in Jack's eyes that told her silently something that she would dearly like him to tell her, and yet that she was almost afraid to hear. But he was going. Let him go ! He never, never could have cared twopence about her. It was all a mistake, and she was a "silly," and such a "silly" that, as she sat on the soft grass dreamily watching the sun sink behind the distant forest line, her eyes filled with tears. There would be no one now to talk to like a brother, who would tease her until she angered, and then laugh at her ; no one who would treat her as if she was a woman, and not a child to be talked nonsense to ; no one who could really appreciate the music she so loved herself. No, all that would be at an end at any rate. What was he going off like this for ? Her father had always treated him kindly. He was the son of one of his oldest friends, Sir John Dudley, and he had made him welcome at all times to his house� had in fact treated him like a son. And now, without one word of explanation, he was going away amongst strangers ; going away somewhere where he might die, and no one care to know who he was or where he came from. This last thought was too much for poor little Jenny. The picture she had conjured up was too distressingly affecting, and she bowed her beautiful little head and sobbed bitterly. "Why, Jenny!" suddenly exclaimed a voice quite close to her, "what can be the matter ? " Jenny almost screamed as she recognised Jack's voice ; yet she stifled her sobs, and without lifting her eyes, answered : "Nothing � only � I � hurt my foot � that is� I'm not very well. But what does it matter to you?" The latter part of this remarkable address was, as Jack subsequently described it, most "snappy." 'Well, Jenny, I don't know that it is any particular business of mine. I wish it were. I wish that I had the right always to keep your tears away. Perhaps Mr. Edmondstone�" "Mr. Edmondstone's a donkey, and you're another," was the tart reply. "What you say is not true. You don't care one atom if I cry my eyes out. Why don't you go away at once as you're going ? What do you come up here for ?" And then, as she glanced at his pained and troubled face, and as he turned slowly to go, as he was bidden, she said in a piteous little voice, "No, Jack, no, don't go away. I'm silly. I didn't mean to be unkind." For an instant he turned, and stood looking straight into her tear-laden eyes, hesitating whether to go or to meet his fate. Then, perhaps, he read some encouragement in those wet lashes, for he gravely returned and threw himself on the grass beside her. "Don't look at me," she said, "I must look horrid. I always do when I've been crying." "Jenny," came Jack's grave voice, "you are never anything but lovely to my mind. You ask me why I am going away, and reproach me with ingratitude for the kindness that has been shown me. Do you think that I shall ever forget the happy time that I have passed here � with you? Jenny � my darling � can you not see how much I love you? Can you not understand what misery it has been for me to see all these fellows, so much richer than l am, and in so much better a position to pay their addresses to you, always about, and to know, Jenny, that I � nothing but a mere plantation overseer � was as far from you as the earth from the stars? What have I to hope for ? How can I expect to gain your love? What show have I with all those other men in the field ? " "Noodles!' came a staccatoed little exclamation from the young lady, who was assiduously pulling at the grass, her head turned away from him." "So I am going away. I don't know where at present, and I don't care much, I can fight my bitterness out better by running away from one who, I know, can never care for me." "But � Jack � how do you know that no one � cares for you?" "Jenny?" No answer. "Can it be possible that you care for me ?" Still no answer. Then, in the dusk that had gathered down upon them, Jack's arm stole round that dear waist; Jack's strong arm drew that yielding little figure to him. "Jenny, do you care for me?'' "No, Jack, I love you," and the little head nestled on his shoulder in sweet shame. No more sadness after that; no more doubting as to the cause of her trouble. Jenny had discovered, as most women do discover, that the one thing necessary to her life was the love of a true man. She had it, and was content to look no further than the present that gave him to her. The past was a forgotten dream, the future a vast blank that was peopled with the presence of the man she loved best ; but the present, with its wealth of happiness that was hers to cling to, and her whole loving nature went out unreservedly to the man she now knew she loved so dearly. * * * * * Half-an-hour later Jenny entered the house, Jack fol- lowing not far off. "Where have you been to, Jenny ?" asked her mother. "Out on the terrace, mother, and Jack has come up to dinner, and to give an account of himself.' "Why, Jack ! " exclaimed Mrs. Sinclair, "I hear you are going to leave us ! Where are you going, boy? " "Well, Mrs. Sinclair, I don't quite know yet, but the fact is, I want to see the South Sea Islands, and I have had an offer to go as Government agent in a schooner starting from this port." " The Islands ! " exclaimed Jenny, "Why, isn't it awfully dangerous work, Jack? " " Not a bit,' he replied, "men go down there, and make out that they have passed through all sorts of dangers and horrors, but it is all nonsense. They just want to make heroes of themselves. I've heard so much about the place that I'm going down there for a trip. We shall not be more than a few months away, and shall return to this port." "I hope what you say is right, Jack," said Mrs. Sin- clair ; "you high-spirited fellows are rather too apt to make light of danger, but I think you are of the stuff that comes through difficulties triumphantly. But take care of your- self. We are all fond of you at Magnolia, and you must return safely to us." What an anxious yet loving glance was that which met Jack's eyes as he lifted them to Jenny. Edmondstone, indeed ? There was no deception in what that trustful glance told him. It was not long after dinner that Jack found himself on the verandah, alone with Jenny. They had decided as yet to say nothing of their engagement. Love was so fresh, so new and delicious, that it seemed foolish to bring mundane considerations to break the spell. " So you will go, Jack, dear, after all your professing to love me ?" whispered Jenny. " I must, my darling ; if I get the appointment now I cannot draw back. Possibly it may lead to my getting some position under Government, and being able in a few years to take a dear little wife home. No matter where I am, darling, you will always be in my thoughts ; and when I return we will tell your father and mother � that's to say, if you haven't changed your mind." " Jack !" said Jenny, reproachfully ; " you know that I shall never cease loving you. If we must part, we must ; I suppose you know best. I shall pray God every night and morning to send my boy back safe to me." It was a quiet corner of the verandah; no one was about, and Jack once more took that dear little figure in his arms, and their lips met in one long lingering kiss.  "So you're our G. A., are you, Mr. Dudley?" said 

 Captain Hawker, of the schooner Dancing Polly, as they met some days later in the port. The captain was a short, thick-set man of about five-and-forty, pock-marked, of a lowering eye, and he appeared to have partaken somewhat freely of the cup that both cheers and intoxicates. "I am, Captain," replied Jack. "Hum! I suppose ye' re like the rest of us, eh? A short run and a full complement. Ye know when yer bread's well buttered. Ye've got eyes to see nothing ye're not supposed to see. Is that yer sort, or are ye one of them psalmsinging crew as tells about "our pore black brethern?" "You'll find me stand by you, Captain, as long as you stand by the Government instructions, but" � and here Jack's expression was unmistakably determined � "if you once attempt to 'run any rigs' upon me it will be the worst day in your life's history. You hear me !" The captain, somewhat discomforted, laughed awkwardly and replied, "In course, that's all right. We'll make that all right. Come and liquor ?" But Jack declined. His position with this man was a difficult one. It was pretty evident that he was not over- scrupulous in his dealings with the "pore black brethern." and it might become Jack's painful duty to put him in his right position. Under the circumstances, therefore, he thought it better that there should be as little familiarity between them as possible. Jack knew his position, and he meant to keep it ; he was determined that the captain should keep his. The Dancing Polly lay alongside the wharf. She was to go in a couple of days, taking return islanders� boys, that had served their term, and taking their trade with them were now off and back to barbarism, and in some cases cannibalism. "They wants a bit o' man; that's about their idea," remarked the captain. "Beef's nothing to them fellars if they can only get hold of a good fat miss'nary, or suthin of that sort. Religion taken internally 's about their figure," and he laughed heartily at his wondrous witticism. The trade the islanders took back with them was varied in the extreme. For some days previously they had been investing their earnings about the town, and shops were invaded by groups, guns overhauled, Snider rifles in- spected, and Indian red purchased. Many of them were adorned with bead necklaces and handkerchiefs wondrous in pattern and dazzling in colour. Tomahawks, pipes, saws, nails, tobacco, matches, gunpowder, linen, and beads, such were amongst the articles with which each islander filled his box. For these "boys" had many of them, during their stay of three years, shot up from weedy striplings into gallants whose thoughts were intent upon a dusky bride or brides, and their purchases were made with a view not only to captivate the fair, but to propitiate the pater. "One fellar tomahawk buy 'im four fellar pig; four fellar pig, one fellar Mary." Such were the quoted market prices of the island beauties, so that it was little wonder if deep thought and earnest consideration were brought to bear on purchases made with such an end in view. The currency of the realm was a closed book to them, and it was not unusual to hear an islander who had previously primed himself with market prices, as quoted by his countrymen, decline to give eighteen shillings for an article, as exorbitant and out of all reason, all he would give being "one fellar pound." The only article of wear- ing apparel on which they seldom or never ventured was that of boots. The shape, make, and size of their feet were so uncompromising that they gave up all hopes of arriving at such a pitch of civilisation as that denoted by the use of boots. New white stockman's moles were indis- pensable, as also were belt, pouch, and knife. At night they strolled about the town in gangs, staring in at the public-houses, some of them managing to obtain a taste of the forbidden liquor by some means with which they were evidently familiar. It was peculiar to note the bonhomie that existed be- tween the white working men and these islanders, or kanakas, who at election time were held up as taking the bread out of the mouths of the formers' wives and children � who were supposed to monopolise the labour that by right was the portion of the white man � who, it was stated, were overrunning the country. Here they were, the white men chaffing the black, the mouths of the latter expanding across their faces with amusement, and displaying teeth that might be envied by many a Caucasian. And the store- keepers, the demagogues and champions of the "wurking man"� -here they were, good honest souls, with smiles on their faces, cringing and truckling to the kanakas in order to get them to buy their goods. When the "wurking man" was in the ascendant, it was good enough to shout with the largest crowd ; but when the islanders had their masters' money in their pocket c' etait bien autre chose. It was these men, who would never have risen from the elevated posi- tion of dealing out tape, but who, thanks to the planters having employed black labour, had become large store- keepers, pocketing hundreds of the planters' pounds an- nually,� it was these men who in their deep thankfulness howled about "Queensland for the white man." Such is the gratitude to be expected and found in North Queensland. Beat a cur, and he will fawn on and cringe to you ; pet him and feed him, and he will snarl at and turn on you. At the period of the departure of the Dancing Polly, the prospects of the sugar industry, on which the prosperity of the North principally depended, were exceedingly poor. Millions had been expended on machinery, horses, the wages of skilled and unskilled labour; and storekeepers, merchants, and shipowners, the whole North in fact, had been profiting by the capital expended. A certain propor- tion of black labour Queensland planters were obliged to have, for in such a new country, where goldfields and tin- fields break out at odd times and seasons, when it was the custom of all the white men to leave on such occasions, without consulting their employers' interests in the least � when hundreds of thousands of pounds perhaps were de- pendent on the possession of that labour, it was evident that black labour they must have. The outlook, therefore, was very threatening when a Government adverse to this labour was placed in power. Mr. Sinclair's face became very clouded when he thought of the difficulties arising and what the effects of this opposi- tion might mean to him. He had invested every penny of his wife's and his own fortune in this plantation ; in fact had gone further and obtained advances from the banks. No one could have anticipated such a crisis as this arising, � a crisis that might prove fatal to half the North. So, when Jack departed, he left the Sinclairs, father and mother, to heavy thoughts, indeed. He carried with him the fond love of a sweet girl. She had always her love to think of and pray for. But with the elder people, to whom the golden promise of their youths was dead, it was hard indeed for them to think that at an early day they might, have to look straitened, circumstances, if not ruin, in the face.  Chapter III. "The Dancing Polly, schooner, Captain Hawker, for the South Seas, with return Islanders. Mr. J. Dudley, G.A." Such was the announcement that was read by Jenny, through eyes half blinded with tears, in the local paper, and her thoughts followed that ship, blown about and buffetted by heaven, with such a longing that seemed to her almost enough to make it turn and come back to port, captain, G. A., return Islanders, and all. Poor Jenny ! There are breakers ahead, little girl ; cruel locks that will wrench and tear at your loving heart, until even you pray that death may gather you home. * * * * * There is a fresh breeze from the Sou' -West, and over a waste of seething water the Dancing Polly is pitching and rolling, now rising and throwing the white spray in masses from her bows, now plunging into the trough of the sea as if she would dive into the dark green water, and carry her living freight with her. She is a week out, and Jack Dudley, who stands on the poop smoking a briar pipe, and dressed in that careless d�shabille that landsmen adopt at sea, has had ample time to study the character of the captain with whom he sails. Truth to tell, the more he sees of him the less he likes him. Drunk when he came aboard, drunk he has remained since, if one may judge by a flushed and bloated face, and a breath that smells like a distillery in active operation. Further, Jack discovered that, although the vessel was nominally in the captain's charge, the com- mand virtually devolved upon the mate, one of those reck- less, devil-may-care adventurers of whom so many are to be found in the colonies. This latter, also, indulged with 

 considerable freedom in the rum that had been brought with them, and exhibited a large, whole- hearted opinion as to the manner of enlisting Islanders that made Jack think, that before the voyage was over he was likely to experience considerable trouble. The captain's ill -disguised dislike of him was evidently shared by the mate, who, from his behaviour, led him to think that he had a seaman's con- tempt for what he considered over-scruplousness in a landsman. The crew were a mixed lot, and looked more like an assortment of pirates than a party engaged in " en- listing" islanders. They consisted of several South Sea Islanders, civilised as far as conformity to European habili- ments and the worst of European vices go, but with faces so villainous that it was easy to see that once roused they could exhibit the worst qualifications of the savage. Besides these were four sailors of varied nationalities � one Greek, two Danes, and an Irishman, ready for any devil- ment under the sun, provided there was fighting in it. About the decks, attired in their bright-coloured hand- kerchiefs lay the return islanders, day after day watching the horizon for the first sign of their beloved islands, and smoking like funnels. Altogether the scene was unique in these modern times, it did look so very much like what a slaver must have been in the old days. The Captain had been at first officious in his attentions, trying to get Jack to drink by all sorts of means. He tried persuasion, but it failed ; reasoning, but his arguments were, in colonial phraseology, "too thin." Finally, he tried bullying. "I suppose, Mr. Dudley, you think yerself too good to drink with the likes of us. Ye're blue-blood, you are? But let me tell yer that, swell as ye are, yo're not man enough for me. Ye're one of them snivelling sort as carries tales about the 'slave-trade' and gets honest seamen into trouble. Ye psalm-singing hound!" he yelled in his drunken fury. "Repeat that again, Captain Hawker," said Jack, look- ing very pale, but what the Americans call "ugly." "Kindly repeat that again." "Ye think ye're going to bounce me, do yer ? Me, as commands this 'ere ship ! Ye're a low-lived � " The rest of the sentence was finished in the scuppers to lee-ward, for Jack had not held the light-weight champion- ship at Oxford during three successive years, to be insulted gratuitously by a drunken seaman. There was a rush of men standing about to pick the cap- tain out, and muttered growls as to "what the h � he was doing with the skipper?' One man hustled Jack rather unceremoniously, and got sent after his master for his pains. The crew looked ugly, and the Islanders, with eyes gleaming with excitement crowded round the combatants. Altogether things did not look pleasant for Jack when the mate arrived, and wanted to know "what all this shivoo was about ? " The Captain, purple in the face, with blood streaming from a nasty flesh wound across his features, yelled to the crew to "put that � in irons;" but the mate, with a not too friendly glance at Jack, which was returned with interest, seized the angry commander by the arm and dragged him off to his cabin, where the two could be heard in angry discussion, that subsequently toned down to an abusive mumble. The crew eyed Jack, and Jack the crew ; but after the latter had expended a little empty curs- ing they retired to the fo'scle to talk the affair over. By-and-bye the mate emerged from the cabin, and with a sort of annoyed smile on his face, said to Jack, "You must'nt take no notice of what the captain said, Mr. Dudley. He's got a little more liquor aboard than's good for 'im. He's a bit roughish at times, and does'nt know what he's saying, so it's to be hoped you won't bear any ill-will." "Look here, Mr. Maxwell," replied Jack, "there is no one on this vessel that desires to maintain peace and order more than I, but if Captain Hawker thinks that he has a right to insult me, he will find himself grievously mistaken. I am come as Government agent aboard this vessel, and I shall do my duty in that capacity without the advice or in- terference of anyone." The mate retired growling out something about a " blooming drunk," and "no intention to insult." After this little episode the captain treated Jack with as much politeness as he was capable of showing, but there evidently lurked a recollection of the punishment he had received, and on several occasions he felt certain that the deep confabulations between mate and captain related to him. At last one evening, a joyous yell from the islanders announced "Land ahead," and away on the port-bow there appeared a dark jagged line apparently floating in the sky. As they approached nearer this deception ceased, land and sea met, and the island appeared more plainly. No run for cattle there, no anxiety about burning grass, for the whole island was covered with the rank virgin forest that springs from volcanic soil alone. Trees laden with vines grew almost to the water's edge, the island being girt with but a thin line of yellow sand. Here and there a huge volcanic rock sprang bold and bare through the sur- rounding vegetation, and birds of gorgeous plumage flew with endless chattering from tree to tree, For some dis- tance from the shore the water was comparatively smooth outside which the white breakers made an edging of foam. And the heat of the climate in those jungles was intense. The groups of cocoanut trees that marked the vicinity of a native village, were almost forced without the aid of labour. The earth gave forth a sort of warm steam like that of a hothouse. There were no boys to go ashore on this island so the schooner bore away to the north east when more islands became visible. Then there nearly happened to the Dancing Polly an event that has terminated the career of many a good vessel. Just as they were approaching an island on which they had to land some return boys, the breeze suddenly failed them and there came on a dead calm. A very heavy swell is nearly always setting in towards those treacherous coral reefs encircling the island, on the outside of which the sea is of such a depth that it is impossible to anchor. Here then was the Dancing Polly, dancing apparently to her death, sails flapping hopelessly against her masts, and nothing to save her. Useless was it to put the boats out to try and keep her from that fatal reef, the swell swept her steadily towards the white line of breakers. To increase the horror of the situation the night fell, a dull, dark, oppressive hot night, just such a one as was a fitting accompaniment to the wreck of a gallant ship. As for the human beings on board there was the choice of a death by drowning on the one hand, or that of being butch- ered by the savages on the other. None on board that ship at least looked upon the falling into the hands of the natives as anything but certain death. Now they could hear the sound of the swell breaking on the reef. Another hour , might see many of them in eter- nity. The captain raved and swore, and was helpless. The mate watched everything in dogged desperation, like a man accustomed to act for himself, and as one who constantly held his life in his hands. One death was as good as another to him. It mattered but little when or how it came. He had led his own life, sparing none, considering none, devoting all his means to the indulgence of himself alone, and now � Well, it was to end, that was all. Who shall tell what Jack's thoughts were as they drifted towards that belt of white? Ah! It was bitter to him to die thus. Never again to see those sweet eyes, that haunted him always, beaming brimful of love into his own. Never again to near that sweet whisper of "I love you, Jack ! " Never to hold that dear little figure in his arms again. Future life indeed ? What had a future life to promise against the sweets of this. What if they should meet again in spirit ! Would Jenny's eyes smile as sweetly? No, it was not pos- sible. Were he sure of eternal happiness �were such even now within his grasp, Jack felt within him that which would cast it from him as worthless, compared to the bliss of holding his loved one only once more in his arms, and letting his soul die out, his lips pressed to hers. The white line of breakers were not a hundred yards from them, the boats were out and provisions and nautical instruments were being passed into them, under rapid directions delivered by the mate, when suddenly there came a faint puff of wind from landwards. " Haul the yards round! Hard aport with that helm!" yelled the captain. There was an instant of fearful suspense. Then there came another puff, and the schooner wore slowly round Then another, and she seemed to be holding her own. After half-an-hour, that seemed like ten hours, during which it would be hard to say if she were drifting on to the reef, or 

 if she were stationary, the breeze became more steady, and finally every one breathed freely, when it was evident she was making way, and increasing her distance from that treacherous coral. That night the captain was, drunk, as he said, to cele- brate the occasion ; as Jack said to himself, 'to make sure that his wretched nature was still in the ascendant.' * * * * * * " Now then, get out those boats there ! Where's them niggers' boxes. Now Mr. G. A., I suppose you will go with the boats," shouted the captain. In was some three days later, and the vessel was abreast an island, on which return boys were to be landed. This island was of some extent, and the boys came from an inland tribe that were at war with the coast tribe, and some doubt existed as to their being allowed to land peaceably. This they were obliged to risk, however, and rifles and re- volvers were passed into the boats in case they were re- quired. The captain had some idea of recruiting a few boys from this island, and a quantity of trade was also taken in as exchange for articles required. Three black boys and a white man, all armed, comprised Jack's boat's crew, whilst the mate went in another boat. When all was ready, they started to pull towards a beach that looked like a good landing place, being freer of the dense scrub which afforded protection and cover to evil-disposed niggers in ambush. When within about a hundred and fifty yards from shore a "crack" was heard, a puff of smoke went up from a bushy point, and their first welcome � a bullet � struck the water some 20 yards in front of Jack's boat, and rico- cheted between it and the mate's. "I will come to meet you, darling!" sang Jack's white man, as he bent to his oar. " Seems as if we were old acquaintance, sir, by the familiar way they greet us," he added. Amongst the boys to be landed was Jack's old friend "Black Beetle" who belonged to the coast tribe, and, who was very indignant at this manner of welcoming his return. 'My word, Missa Dudley, bye'm bye me shoot 'im that fellar," he remarked, and he handled his Snider as if longing to begin. No further shots were, however, fired, and the boats were permitted to land peaceably. Then the boys' boxes were taken out and placed on the beach ; the trade, consist- ing of tobacco, Indian red, tomahawks, and knives, were displayed temptingly on the sand; the boats, with one of the crew to keep watch, were kept afloat in case of emergency, and the islanders came down in groups to in- spect the treasure brought back by their countrymen, and to haggle for trade. " Doesn't look particular healthy," remarked the mate ; " they've left their women behind, so you'd better look out for squalls," remarked the mate to Jack. Everything appeared to be going on peaceably. The chief had received a present of a tomahawk and two knives, and further wanted a roll of Indian red ; but this the mate refused. All of a sudden the mate sang out, "Lookout for yourselves ; make for the boats !" and Jack had time to see an islander deal one of his crew a terrific blow with a club, when he suddenly lost consciousness, having been felled from behind in a similar manner. There was a run of a few yards to the boats, the re- mainder of the boats' crews shooting the foremost of their assailants. Then the boats were pushed off, and the men scrambled in, spears and arrows following them in a shower, making it a wonder that any escaped. The mate was speared through the arm, and revenged himself by boring the chief with a bullet at about 50 yards. Several of the boat's crew were wounded with arrows. But where was the Government agent? Lying on the sand, face downwards, the blood flowing from a desperate wound at the back of his head. Dead ? Well, the mate had no time to inquire ; but one thing was sure, that if he were not dead now, he most assuredly would be killed before they got back to see. And so the Dancing Polly sailed away without her G. A. ; but somehow fehe managed to recruit her comple- ment, and, further, when she returned her log showed that she was full at the time of the G. A.'s death.  Chapter IV. Affairs in Magnolia were going all wrong. Day after day saw the gloom in Mr. Sinclair's face deeper and more hopeless. It was of no use his working hard, early and late. Fate seemed to have decided on his downfall, and over he must go. In the first place the crops were suffer- ing terribly from a long and merciless drought ; in the second the market for sugar for that year was almost destroyed by the importation of beetroot sugar, that for the time being took the place of cane-sugar, which had little or no sale ; thirdly, there were the difficulties of obtaining labour to cope with. The supply of island labour was, by reason of most stringent regulations formed by the Govern- ment then in power, almost quashed. To supply its place labour from all corners of the world had been introduced, and had proved useless except to empty the pockets of the planters and fill the colonial gaols. Finally, the banks of whom he had borrowed money to assist him in the first outlay were now closing in upon him and demanding payment. The ways of colonial banks are strange. Whilst the appearance of things is good, nothing can be more accom- modating than a bank. Want its money? Indeed, no! Such a thing would be the last thought of that bank. But, only let one's affairs become just a little mixed; let the temporary depression in business place its debtor under a cloud, and, although that debtor will in the course of time be able to pay 40s. in the pound, down comes the bank. A bank is an institution without consideration or discrimination ; and the man that can best get to the right side of a bank is the man possessed of nothing but con- summate effrontery and "brass." Only let a timid man attempt such a thing, though he be as honest as the day and sound as the Bank of England, and he will get figura- tively sat upon and extinguished. Mr. Sinclair happened to be a gentleman, a man accus- tomed to have his word taken without question � a man brought up to loathe and detest the least symptom of "cheek " � and he suffered accordingly. His feelings were trampled upon by a set of directors that had all but truckled to him to get him to borrow from them, and day by day he grew more gloomy and depressed. Worse than all, he began to show signs of impatience to those to whom he had always been kind � to his wife and little Jennv. They suffered in silence and without com- plaining; but poor Jenny thought that her cup was full when he reproached her with having refused young Edmon- stone. " I could not, mother � I could not. Not if he had as many millions as he has thousands," she cried, weeping bitterly. And then, falling on her mother's neck, she told the best friend she had on earth the story of her love for Jack. Her mother comforted and soothed her as best she could ; but poor Jenny went about the house like a ghost for many days afterwards, afraid to meet her father lest he should even look reproachfully at her. At last the crash came. Late one night Mr. Sinclair came home and went into his bedroom. He threw himself into a chair by his wife's bedside, and leant forward and buried his face in his hands, resting them on the bed in front of him. His wife, that had loved him so long and so faithfully, stole gently to him and twined her arm round his neck ? "What is the matter, dear? Tell me the worst," she cried ; " I can bear it." Then it all came out : they were irretrievably ruined. Both of their fortunes had been swamped in the general smash. They must leave Magnolia at once, for the manager for the bank was coming in to take charge. She, good worthy woman that she was, faced the calamity bravely, and did her best, but without avail, to cheer him. He would go into his' dressing-room and lie down; he "could not sleep," he said. So they parted ; and he pressed the last kiss she was to receive on earth from those dear lips on her brow before he left her. The next day Mr. Sinclair was found lying in the bed in his dressing-room, dressed and dead. Jennv had never experienced the bitter grief of losing a loved relative; but now she thought that her heart would break as she remembered that almost his last words had been reproachful. She scarcely had time to think of her own grief, however, for her mother was seriously ill from the effects of the sudden double shock. Mr. Sinclair had died, they said from the effects of a fit brought on by too 

 great a strain on the nerves; and now the house was hushed, and Jenny trod that once happy home with eyes wild with grief and almost mad with the pain of bitter sorrow . For mother� dear, darling, patient mother� was dying. First her father, and then her dearest and best � her mother. Oh ! the agony of prayer that Jenny offered to the Supreme Being at that sad time ! What had she done that this double grief should come upon her? But it was to be. All Jenny's prayers and supplications were un- availing; and within a week of her husband this fond mother was laid by his side, and Jenny was alone in the world. Hardly had this shock fallen before the local paper an- nounced the return of the Dancing Polly without poor Jack. Killed ? More deaths ? Was all love to be wrenched out of her life in one swoop ? Then was there, indeed, little worth living for. The brightness and glory of her life were gone, and Jenny prayed to be taken as well. Then at this terrible time, that she looked back upon in her after-life as on a horrible dream, her health gave way to the strain of grief, and Jenny was brought to the verge of the next world. Luckily she had kind friends who nursed her through her long illness ; but when she recovered she looked more like one called back from the dead than the once bright- eyed merry Jenny. It was pitiable to see that tiny figure, clad in black, wander about the house, with her face pale and hopeless. Ah! that horrible word, ' Never !' Never again to feel the touch of the "vanished hand," nor hear the sound of the '' voice that is still;" those kindly voices that never spoke to her but in terms of kindness and endear- ment. Not in the whole wide world was there a single soul whom she had loved like those that had faded so suddenly from out her sunny life. There was one that loved her, certainly, and whose kindly sympathy had been deeply felt. Young Edmonstone had done all that lay in his power to render her aid and com- fort, and it was with his mother that she was now staying. Never had she thought better of this young fellow, who was at heart so kind and gentle. But the time came when she found she must do something for herself � something to make a living, at which she might feel independent. Her friends did all they could to per- suade her to stay, but she could not bear the sight of the place where she had suffered so much misery ; so with their aid she got the situation of a governess in the family of some good people in Sydney. "I cannot tell you how much I have felt your kind- ness," she said to young Edmonstone, before leaving, in answer to his unuttered appeal to her for love. "You asked me once for what it was not in my power to give you. I feel deeply and am thankful for the regard you bear me ; and, oh, so grateful for the manner in which you have shown it You are an honest, worthy man, Mr.' Edmon- stone, and I hope that in your future life you will meet a mate that is worthy of you. But for me, love is dead. I am not fit to be the wife of any man. I shall drag out my life as I am, and only hope that the day may come � and come soon � when I shall join my dear dead in a happier world than this." With this poor Edmonstone had to content himself, and poor little Jenny, in her black dress, and looking smaller than ever, as she stood on the deck of the steamer, faded from his sight and from his life, and went out alone to fight her way through the world. * * * * * Six months had passed since Jenny left Magnolia, and, although she still wore her black dress, the climate of New South Wales had forced the roses back into her cheeks, and a subdued sadness that was inexpressibly affecting to see in one so young had settled down upon her life. Everyone liked her. The young girls whom she had en- gaged to teach thought that no one in the world was to be compared to Miss Sinclair, and their parents treated the little woman with as much kindness and consideration as they would show to their own kindred. They had heard her story ; and to Mrs. Brownlow, kind, motherly woman, had Jenny confided the story of poor Jack's death in the islands. Now and then Jenny got news from North Queensland. Once it was that Captain Hawker and the mate of the Dancing Polly had been condemned to a long term of im- prisonment for kidnapping. Then there came to Sydney a rumour that a Government agent, supposed to have been killed in the islands, was not dead, but had been seen a per- fect wreck from fever and unable to move, under the care of a missionary. One day Mrs. Brownlow, who was reading the paper, suddenly said to Jenny: " Why, look here, dear ! Here is a Sir J. Dudley come to Sydney. That must be the father of your poor friend." Jenny's heart leapt into her mouth as she thought of see- ing the relative of one whom she had held so dear. A few days afterwards Mrs. Brownlow came into the schoolroom with a very grave face, and said � " Jenny, Sir John Dudley has called to see you. My child, you must prepare yourself for a very great surprise. He is waiting for you in the drawing-room." Jenny, with a bewildered look, went down stairs as if in a dream. She opened the door and saw someone sitting there with his back towards her, and with his hair close cropped to his head. Jenny, feeling herself trembling at she knew not what, advanced into the room, surprised that her visitor did not rise to greet her. Could he be ill ? She passed round so that she could see his face, stared for a moment at him with eyes gradually widening with astonish- ment; then she threw her arms into the air, and, without uttering a sound, fell into the arms of Jack himself. It was some minutes before she came to herself, and found herself lying on the sofa. Once she opened her eyes and gazed into Jack's face that was bending above her, and then closed them again with a smile, as if she thought it was a dream that she would not break. Then she recovered herself, and with murmuring surprise whispered : "Can it be really be? Is it you, Jack? or is it only a dream ? " It was Jack, but Jack so changed that it was scarcely any wonder that she did not know him. His hair was short, and he was pale and enfeebled like an old man. His story was a short one. Struck down by a blow from behind, he lost consciousness, and when he came to himself had found himself nursed and tended by " Black Beetle." The boy had never forgotten Jack's aid when he was in peril, and by dint of using his eloquence to some effect, and his rifle to more, had convinced his countrymen that Jack was not to be murdered and eaten. He nursed him through the fever caused by his wound, and he was beginning to get about, when he was struck down with the malaria peculiar to the country, and which has proved so fatal to white men living in those islands. He was nearly dead with this when a missionary schooner visited the island and took him to their station. Here he recovered, and returned to Sydney by a sailing vessel. On arriving in Sydney; he found that both his father and his elder brothers were dead, and that he had come into the title and fortune. He was on his way to join the Sinclairs at Magnolia when he received a letter from a firm of solicitors at the port, who, thinking he might like to know the news of those with whom he had been familiar, told him of their sad death and of Jenny's presence in Sydney. "And so," concluded Jack, "here I am, and all I want, to hear is my little girl telling me that she loves me still." " I love you, Jack," she murmured, " once and for all time. And you, Jack? and have you no confessions to make me of a dusky bride with a ring through her nose ? " she added laughingly. A few months later little Jenny Sinclair became Lady Dudley, and a stately little lady she made, too. Captain Hawker died in prison from being deprived of the grog that had sustained his life so long. Mr. Edmonstone married a planter's daughter, became stout, and when the two families Dudleys and Edmonstones met in Sydney last year Jenny slily compared his looks with those of her brown stalwart husband, and decided that her taste had not led her astray. THE END.
