THE STORYTELLER. 

 THE EOMANCE OF IT. 

 By M. FORREST. 

 No doubt it was about as romantic a thing as one could expect to happen in this deadly dull bush life, but it was a pity that it was so cold. Jean shivered, and wished that 

 she had put on thicker shoes. 

 Across the paddock a chill wind blew, moaning round the house in a creepy man ner, rattling windows and rustling through the grass in a fashion calculated to make one unwillingly nervous. Jean had told herself that she could be brave in an emer gency; all highly-strung women can per form wonders of endurance when they are called upon to show their mettle, and Jean was not going to turn back now. 

 As she crouched by the verandah steps, which led down to the paddock, she heard the latch of the gate on the far side fall, and the faint creak of saddle leather. She guessed that it must be nearly 1 o'clock� 1 o'clock on a cold July morning. She de cided that the summer was the best time to choose for eloping after all; but he wouldn't bear of waiting for the summer; by that time she would have been expected! back in Brisbane, and there would be garden . parties at Government-house. The new 

 Governor was given to entertaining, people J 

 said. She wondered what her partners of last winter's dances would Bay when they heard that she had eloped with the stock man at Herston Downs. Bobbie Garrill would laugh in that slow, irritating way of his, and say something clever. They couldn't realise that her lovec^as one of nature's gentlemen, and so handsome. That made up for everything, and how he loved her. She drew lier silk shawl closer about her shoulders'. Robbie had given her that shawl, the result of a bet she bad won trom him at the boating carnival last year. The carpet-snake skin oelt she wore was the only present she had from her stockman, but then theirs had necessarily been a secret wooing. 

 A horse neighed across the paddock, and I she started up.

 In the dim shadows of the myall trees she 

 conld see two deeper moving shadows, and she heard nis step crunch on the short black ened stubble, where the bush fire had swept last week. She slipped down the steps noiselessly, and was in his arms in�an 

 instant, -fie nibbed . her * cold hands j silently in his rough square-tipped fingers, 

 and fed her to where the horses were, tethered. 

 'With a swing of bis strong arms she was in the saddle, and as she gathered the reins into her band and adjusted ber riding skirt, 

 he whispered, looking up from under the. brim of his felt bat as he tightened ber. saddle girth. 

 "You ain't frightened, Miss Jean?" 1 She wished that be wouldn't call her { "Miss." It savoured too much of subordi nation, and she would rather be captured 

 thaif coaxed.. She laid one band lightly on j 

 his shoulder. 

 "No; why should I be?" she asked. 

 "Because you are miles too good for Ihg I likes of me." . j 

 She wished that he would not say "likes." ' Bobbie Cairill was particular about bis 1 grammar, but then�she did not love 

 Bobbie. 

 As they crossed the further paddock, and passed through the little gate which opened on to the main road, beside the wooden culverts, a few drops of rain fell on ber face. 

 "I hope it isn't going to rain." she said, anxkmsiy, fastening the flimsy shawl across 

 ber woollen biouse.

 A sharp canter brought the blood back to her cheeks, and a watery moon showed through a rift m the cloud. They were pawing the wide Warrkal Swamps now and a flight of wild duck flew quacking overt head. It was here that he had one dav gathered wbtea-lilies for her, and she had noticed what handsome eyes he had. She wondered if be remembered that day. Then 

 he spoke� 

 "This is where the roan bullock was bogged in the summer," he said. "The 

 boss and me had no end of a job with 

 him." 

 A mile farther on a chock-and-log fence crossed the road, and, as the stockman leaned over to onen the high gate, the moon looked out and flooded the damp grass and the wild lime-trees which grew near the 

 gate with silver. 

 "It's going to clear after all," he said, lifting the iron catch, and glancing back at 

 her with a smile. 

 His clean-cut limbs .clasped his horse's 6ides, and he ihrew his broad shoulders back with thegrace of perfect muscular de velopment!- He was & splendid-looking man, she thought, and she began to see romance smiling into her life aghin. To think '.hat she, Jeaa.Ffoliot, should be tun ning away with this man, and all for love! 

 It wa>� fascinating to view it thus! The world well lost for love! She felt a glow of delighted self-sacrifice pass over ber, and she laughed back at bim, shaking ber reins to prevent her, hack from Ailing into his mueclera eking jog. 

 "Let us canter again," she said. 

 Round the corner of the road a traveller was approaching them. A traveller who was riding by night to be in time to warn the big stations that the river was coming down a banker, a good-natured sort of man who didn't mind putting himself out for other people's profit, though reaping no pecuniary advantage himself. They could see him clearly in the rapidly-brightening moonlight. He was riding a white horse, and was singing softly to himself as he 

 came. / 

 The stockman swore under his breath. 

 "Lord send he's drunk," he said, for in an instant they had recognised him, and the stockman doubted not that he bad done likewise. But he was not drunk�he never was�and lie hailed them with no ap parent surprise, as they tried to pass him without speaking- . 

 "Good night. Miss Ffobot. I hope there s nothing wrong at the station?" he added seemingly as an after-thought. 

 Jean bent ber head. 

 "No," die arid, and the stockman drove his i till it danced to

 an tried to drive his horse's head between them, but the white horse held its ground. - 

 "Miss Ffotiot's her own mistress," he said savagely. 

 But Jean sat still in her saddle, her head drooping. 

 The traveller took not the slightest notice of the angry man. 

 "You are wet and cold," she said. "When 

 you get into the township you won't care 

 �for obvious reasons�to go to the hotel. You will be damp and miserable before you start on your journey down the country; the river 16 rising by Inglcncuk, and tnev say the bridge is unsound, but there is worse than that.

 known your dead mother: and, my dear, silly little girl, remember that oil and water, no matter how pure the water and how sweet the oil, cannot mix." 

 "Shut you mouth, d�ho you," said the stockman, and he laid his big hand on Jean's waist as though he would drag her from her saddle, and out of the way of the 

 traveller's words. 

 She shrunk from bim ever so little, and

 he traveller looked across at the stock man quietly. 

 "If you nave anything to say-I'll settle with you afterwards, Connor," lie said softly, "bliss Jean is a free agent, and can of course do as she pleases. - That is what surprises me in finding yon took the trouble to sneak off by night in this very uncom
