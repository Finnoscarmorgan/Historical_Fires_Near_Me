 Anolnnr aazzuog .morning proKe out irom the east, speedily ohasiogthe chill and dew of the moonlit night. By the time the sun was two hours' high, its beams were- hot and its light a blaze; and myriads of j the insect. world- filled the ear with their Io* continuous ' hum, whioh swells fuller and fuller uutil itbegina to oeaae, almost sud denly, under the intense heat of .noon. 

 rhe'driving of a hundred and fifty' head of lean cattle between two and three hun' dred miles through a parched country is a serious charge. The youug Australian's breakfast was completed before his compan ions had well begun theirs, so that, by the time Willoughby was ready to mount, the drove was strangling loosely but impatiently up the road.- ,Tbe driver with difficulty held in his strong stook-horse (which rnnuifested no jess impatienod to be 0$) shifting him self restlessly in the saddl/, as hetlingerid talking to his couutryraun'on the.' road in front, -'and throwing alternate ^ glances to ward the cattle, aud toward the dour wlien'oe bis companion, was to appear. . . . With no little' sntistaotion Reuben Kable saw the Englishman's toot in the stirrup at last i arid,'with' a' 'rough '' Gub'd-day',' cap tain'!'' to the old weather-beaten tar they wereleaving behind) add' a nod to the host, be gave, his hotao the head, and -s(ightly bending forward prer ? the .horde's neck to gain power,,. ha gave a three-quarter swing found of-the long thong abaya hJB( head, and back it came with a crack like a rifle. 1 '';H$y, bey, hey ! yoh�ho| !

 and dust swept rapidly round ao elbow .of the bush; und 'the lieutenant saw- nothing but the dingy white cloud ea it rose and swept away on the wind. - The old gentleman- soon afterwards or dered his horse, and rode leisurely un to wards Sydney, with considerably more sa tisfaction than be had felt for some time. His family, had now been -nearly . three, months in Melbourne,, and the agent whom, he had entrusted to discover for him a tract of land worth purchasing, was yet 'unsuc cessful; probably beoause Lieutenant BracJ ton also rented of him the cottage ,-he wa's oooupying in the: town, Willoughby had suggested a personal tour of inspection ; but tho further they advanoed into the in terior, the more sterile and unsatisfactory everything appeared to Europeans, unused to the scorched appearance of Australian vegetation iu the summer months. At length, the names of .Yass, and Argyle, and Sydney came to be ' mentioned by the ''tra vellers they met, as places so near that they felt the inclination to pursue the journey forward, and at least iospebt'the elder Sol-, oriy before finally settling in the new? ''?'*? , From Lupton's inn to the fine fiats at the foot of Mittagong range, where Reuben Kable inten'ded'-to rest his oattle during Ihe haat of the day, is something above thir teen miles, . In some parts the Toad passes overground full of loose stone, which, pul 'feriaed by , the -heot 'and-orusn'fof feet and vehioles, becomes, in summer a thick bed of hot dust ;;' in others, 'steap hills add to ; tne toil of travelling; aud almost the whole -way a close, bush Jbordew the road on both ?ides, rendering the1 air l stagnant and sul try, : Somewhat less than three hours ex ertion; however, brought: the horsemendown into the flats, stretohing far ' away' ia'.^'opet) plains to the left. ^No lobgar urged by dog' , and man, the weary drove relaxed , their, pace, and, turning off the road, . wandered; slowly on in straggling and broken groupB 'toward the spot to wbioh their instinct ;drew' them for water. Willoughby, following hip ?companions example, dismounted iu the shade of the trees ; which here, rooted in rich ground, and supplied with a pleotitude of moisture, sustain spreading heads of the^ thickest foliage that furniah ;the wayfarer .with the most delightful resting- place, . ,., The horses were soon unsaddled and un-r bridled ;:not, however, 1 without .befog first hobbled. 1 ' A 1 mounted bushman'a .'accoutre meets are his horse'a hobblesijor else a long tethtr rope, whioh is ooiledii round the animals neck when travellinp; ; a good blanket or a cloak, made of oposum skins sewn together, to the size of about eight or nine feet by seven, and onpable, when sound ..arid doubled, of,tu.rning.off. a night's rain ^ a tin quart pot, 'and sundry bags containing tea, sugar,' 'hamper,' and beef. The quart pot is gonerally strapped to the saddle in front, on one side; the hobbles on the other; the ration-bags banging aoross, and the blanket, or oposum cloak, carefully formed in,to a long hard roll, and fastened sometimes before and soinetiimM (behind, is bent over the horse's back. ' The tinder box, or its modern substitute, the luoifer rnaioh box, is invariably stowed iu the most dry and secure place the owner oan fiud for it upon his own person.. Willoughby was already biishman enough to recollect his portion of the duties, when be saw his' companion busy .in. kindling a, fire and gatheriug tho fuel; and, by the1 time the slicka wore.bluzing, the two quart pots were filled, ready to be placed in front pifjVhe. fire op the' ^ind.wntfl r'si^lo., ' In ten minutes more mighti bo �oon-th�.Au8traliau- [who fell, to u oertuin extent, bound' to en �0C the part of head-oook; iii oonsideratiop. 

 of the leBi inferior proficiency of his fellow traveller), sitting tailor-fashion' in front . of the fire, watohing intently for the full bubble of the water,- and- directly it showed itself, dropping oarefully into the pot a oapaoious handful of tea. The olick of the opening pooket- knives followed, and the meal wua begun ; the dogs standing round imploring, as earnestly and appealingly as they cau by silence and Bteadfast gazing, their share of their master's provision. ? For a couple of hours the bushmen rested' and refreshed themselves; the hearty. meal, the pipe, . and a yarn soon while away so in rich time beneath a shady tree of a hot day. Whilst Willoughby tied up the bags, and refastened all to the saddles, Reuben Kable took his whip, and walked round the cattle, turning them along the road. Re vived by their rest aud feed, men, :and horses, and dogs, now went on at a lively pitce for /the range. By sundown it was passed, upwards of twelve miles further on the whole accomplished, and the 'mob' safely paddooked for the night. Having now given to the reader a suffi cient sketoh of the customs of stock-driving, it would be wearisome to follow the travel lers a^tep by step. On the road. to Mauaroo Plains, a stook-yard or paddock my be se cured for tho safe custody of the drove every night ; but un the tracts to the far-out dis tricts in some, directions the driver isicom palled ooaasionally to camp in the bush, and watch the oattle all night. In suoh cases, however, thera is generally a second hand, and fhe. .night jb divided in. two,. watoh;es'!bk'Ween: them.' '' Several firea are' sometimes lit at the mouth of a ravine, girt round by rooks too step to be scaled by the oattle, and the drivers' Bleep by ttie fire'el' encompassed by their dogs ; tha beasts are then as secure as if' in a yard. ' So- \\nuoh trouble is involved in the, reoovary- of oattle _jvhioh __sjtray ..away Jon a .journey,, far from their, own run or grazing- ground, that stbokmeo omit no precaution or. vi gilanoe to prevent it, The, beasts generally make back, in course of time.' to' their .own run ; but they-rreturn very leisurely� -some- times taking six weeks ip traversing home wards only as mubh ground as they were driven over in as many days; never taking the road/ but Wandering through all the green spots they oan find adjaoent to their route ; luxuriating for a couple of days in a retired grassy 'plat -here, then orossing l a range, aod lingering awhile in some'rioh secluded. nook at, its .base; and so on to the-end of their progress homeward. ./,$ -. Reuben Kabel's object in removing his 

 herd was partly to resoue them from the wild oondition into which they had got through running, amongst a labrynth of mountains quite inaccessible in many places to the horsemen, and partly to remove them to good pasturage, from a locality whioh the bush fires of the past season had left, almost without blade of grass. The tract' of oountry, .he wds 'goiiig to is 'a vast' plain) retaining the . aboriginal appellation .of Manarjo,'aod is 'considered to oontain some of the best graziDg ground for horned oattle in the Australian colonies. A rough idea of its situation may be given by observing that it occupies , the ^extreme point of the eastern lino of ridast, and thus lies, coast wise between the eastern ' and southern settlements^ Far above the sea, and utterly bare of forest, over its main expanse, its winter is pioroing aud desolate. Its extent is such;- that in some parts a rider may' tire a good horse two days: in succes sipn. in riding from bush to. bush. But ^ in pia6BSi'iorig'/naVrloiv' joint's' ' of straggling; forest atretoh.out.fiir 'into! theiopoa ; waste,' strangely bewildering 'the traveller, and tendering the attempt to traverse the ground in foggy-^eather, very, dangerous to^the in expeHerioeai' ??'? Additional periPalso ; arises from the enequality of the 'ground;' i No ranges of importance interseot its surface to serve as landmarks at a distance ! but irregular hollows of various deptbj and little lines of elevated surface no less irregular, ' present^hemaelves.in all direotions. ,. ^.. v Toward.' Ihe 'evening of the. fifth.. day,. Reuben Kab(e suddenly pointed out to his oompanion the termination |pf their journey.' It was a lonely hut, in the depth of the horseshoe bight they bad just entered. From the belt of, the forest they had passed to tlfat on the opposite side of the bight seemed. , little more ' than'' a stone's throw, though the actual distance was three mileB, the hut itself looked like a toy ; the oapaoious stockyard behind was disouraable ; but the idea did not suggest itself of a cattle station. The effect of these gigantic plains in this particular is most surprising, especially on the first occasion that the eye is subjected to their enchantment. About another hour brought thejwearied men and horses to the little bark hut, the jaded cattle being left to mingle with a few of their new assopjatos, which were graxing with sleek hides and plump carcases by a big waterhole at the foot of one of the more prominent elevations' on the line oi the bight. The stockman and butkeeper were both out, and half a dozen kangaroo dogs came hastily out from vari ous, quarters to dispute ;the. entrance of the hut-iwithr their: master ;:? but presently as' one and another recognised him, they changed their bark of defiance into antics and y#lpa oi welcome. ''-'- �-^Xj- r'�V-- V.-.i'-'.^.- The inhabitant of a town may in some de cree imagine the senet-of -enjoyment wbioh is experienced by the bushmau on reaohing ais own hut in a distant part of the oountry, ifter one of these protracted and harassing ourneys ; but ho will still rewajn ignorant �f the delight which ,is felt on rising next morning after a Jnfgbt's;Jresl;/tind- looking jbroad with a feeling that you have now free footin the wilderness;' that your next loor neighbour Will not complain oF your v xespassing on him, if you do: but oiroum-' t loribe .your operations within a circle' of ten n niles 'in . dminetdr.

'' Thea'sBist ance of a blaok, however, was requisite to make sure of: ibe most practicable pass through the ranges; and one was snon found, and mounted' on the stockkeeper's spare horse. Once more 'the young men Bet* out together, with a 'feeling of familiarity, approaching almost to that of brotherhood and an hourly inareasinji sympathy ;' frank- ness and fearlessness were,m�.in ale.aienu in, the character of tbth4. ' ' ' ~ v ' 4 v c *' | The weather continued as it had for some weeks, till the evening of the day on whioh' they set out ; when one of those sudden and complete changes in the state of the atmosphere took, place, to which, the whole of this elovateri region (particularly at this part} is so subject. As they turned the crown of the gap, up wbioh they':had;made their way, the blaok ' fellow suddenly quiokened - his paoe, with the exclamation, ' Murry make haste ! I believe murry togra directly* His countryman reined: his horse and oast bis eye duwn the ravine. ' He's right, Willoughby; here's. a regular fog ooming up the gullies as fast as it can sweep; these fogs will soak one through in about an hour as bad as being run through a* waterbole; :-:W�ll,';it's)no I odds.'; wo' oan' t get away from it.' Willoughby now turned and looked, downward towards (besplaica. Every object was hidden ; the whole of the immense expanse , was one rolling, sea of mist. ' Before they 'could withdraw their eyes from the magnificent spectaolu, the de luge of yapqur was scaling pp.int.after. point of ..the mountain, until it rose iu volumes , up rthe:. very, ravine at the brink of Which' the/ stood, 'and, moving with the Bpeed of �t earn;. was over them, around them, and far away boyond them, in a few seconds. A|moB| in un instant, too, it. swa� it is ihiokes't ;'. hot a tre� oould be seen at- twenty feat distant, and the. whote of the air around was one wide-spread extent of moving motes of spray. / '; .; ' , ' Now, Joe, the Jlairine,' said the Austra liao, addressing his, black countryman v by his standing title among the whites, ,' mini} you don't tnke the wrong gully down the mountain.' ' . I Oh baal (not) me-stupid, 'Mister Kable, said the blaokfellow.'' What for' you pialla (-a/A) like that ?';''r MV, 'Well, push along ; it'll be , no j joke |to oamp 6n.the.*mbuntain;in this .fo^i'i-' ^ v-1 'The guide did as he was urged. The road was devious, and in many places pre 

 oipitous I but he pursued his course with alt the unerring instinct of savage life, Before the darkuess ,liad established itself amongst the more dense timber of the mountain, the party bad-issued into the scantier bush and longer lingering light of (he low grounds; The black immediately struok across 'to' intarseot a toad, wbioh span conducted them pnqe more to a atation. Here the horses were hobbled and turned out,' and the riders were soon sharing' with, the stockman and his hut-keeper the ever welcome pot of tea, and some cold corned beef and damper. .... A light rain fell next morning.; but it was' too trivial' to be allowed to impede their progress. About the middle of the afternoon, Willoughby remarked that it was begiuing to come down more' and? more heavily, ar-d bade fair for an evening and night of heavy'1 rain. Reuben, who had now ; taken the ;lead as guide, directed ihijt' attention to the mouth of a gully towards Wh'i6h! the'y'were advancing,' and-' replied � 'About a, mile. and a half will bring us to the station/ where we shall be sure of dry houBe-room aqd .plshtyH^ eat, iijit rjainB.for a week.*' ' ''.'.'.,'. . '' ' A' few.'fairit h'6rsei'tra6k8 ' were' here and there visible, as they walked their horses up the; abarply-risiDgihollow ; but there was nothing like tha token of traffic to a muOh or long inhabited spot. Wiiloughby peroeived that fhey^had turned 4jr,�o^ly?in to one of ..the. larger, rangesolibe .lowland*, and about half an hour elapsed before they reached the crown 6f,the ridge, where it was lowest � a spot known in bush lan guage -as 'a gap.' .These gaps .or low. paints 'of the ridges, ;ar^ of, pourse, takan^ advantage of, whenever prablioablo for cros sing' arrange! of' hills; and' the gap: is, at; lained by following up to it the moat gently sloping level, and otherwise unobstructed gully. Beyond the gap the ground again fell, but w;th an easy declivity ; the main line of it was covered by a swamp, so that ihe horsemen had to keep the edge of the space, where the sapling timber again almost barred their^pasBuge. v At length, between Forcing their way. by main. strength, through; the sapling,, scrub, and jumping. the dea.d, trees whioiriay fallpain all directions athwarc the swamp,, the , horses made good iheirj way to the. bottom. ? Here. the. spurs lhat' ran down from the leading, ridge, mudsbs' twixt two of whioh was oontainsd the iwamp they had follotred, terminated'io opan ground. ' The Australian rode ibriskty up on to the1 hip of the one on the righ'ti snd there oh'ecking his horse and facing ? toward the clear expanse of the flat in front,' awaited the approach of.

A oomplele bay, you' tMi between this spur of the rang^e and the next; I should think there is a good 'fifty acres; and that's cultivation ground enough for any new iettler* .Tfonder is the huj; mailer and men, , I bisiieyr, 'all mess . together ; but .it's, a good big, one.

There is nothing that cauiea us to rea lize the presence of a strong practical mind like its achieving, in our very sight, a sound and able project. From this time Wil loughby Braoton, though by no means in ferior in ability ou his own more perilous element, felt an irresistible attraction for Reuben's character, how finally to ' result will be seen hereafter. Aa no flattery of thanks' was required, so few, simple, and sinoere were those that were rendered. The young men made, their way down and 'across, the. flat,, where, as yet, only a few acres, were fenced off for agriculture, and 'once more reoeived tha 'cheerful hospi talities of a bush hut. The owner was ab sent, and the man in charge was unable' to say when he was likoly to returnjroai Port Phillip district, whither he had proceeded with 'the remainder of his horned cattle. The ,�'ex't|I, day :'th'ey' �noe more rode off iai company, ' parting, whore .their roada di- verged,1' with m'u'tual regret; and not till Willoughby bad given his promise to make a trip to Broken Bay;. immediately the af fairs of his own fjwjjv.'were auspiciously arranged. ?
