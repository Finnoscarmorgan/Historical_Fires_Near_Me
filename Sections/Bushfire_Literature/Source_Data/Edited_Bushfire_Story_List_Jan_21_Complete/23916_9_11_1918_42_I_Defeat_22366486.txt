 MUTMUTBILLY. AN AUSTRALIAN SOTRY. 

 CHAPTER I.�Defeat. (Telegram). Department of Public Instruction, Sydney. "You will take charge of public school, Mutmutbilly, on November 20. "J. DAWSON." 

 By FLORA YOUNG. 

 "Mutmutbilly! I had never heard of the place. It must be in the Never- Never surely. I looked up my Moore's Admanac, and found that the scene of 

 my future labours was on the Southern Tablelands. I was sorry. I had hoped to be sent out to Bourke or Wilcannia, but literary aspirants, smarting under the lash of defeat, can .no more ?oe choosers than can the members of a certain other fraternity, especially after storm ing the department with "An immediate removal into the country or my resigna tion." The genial chief had looked hard into my eyes and understood or thought he did, which suited me just as well. The fatherly look of compassion in the fine grey eyes said quite plainly, "Poor lassie, she's had a doing ; some man of course," and he was right. It was a man who had driven the iron Into my soul, although not in the way the chief thought. "Where will I be sent?" was the cue .clear thought in my tired and confused brain during the tram-ride home. Home I I had no home. To rid myaelf for ever of the miserable apology I bad for a Lome was the real motive (or the supreme effort I had made to win. And I had lost. 1 hurried up to my room. To have spoken civilly to her Just then would have been impossible. Throwing my out door things on a chair, I took a letter from my purse�the very touch of it made my spirit writhe. That crumpled bit of paper bad been my undoing. No, It was not from a faithless lover, the dtar old chief was out there, but from that individual, the lifting of wiuseiea can make or mar, the representative of a treat publishing firm, "Miss Campbell, "Sear Madam,�l have gone taiefully through your MBB., and while thank ing you for submitting your copy to us, 1 regret to say that I cannot recom mend its acceptance. It certainly sf o�s a fair amount of ability, the plot is good, but the crudeness and Ice >her�ney of the beginner is very evident, and your frequent use of old etme platitudes manes the ,<jhaaces of your story being -.ccepM-1 very remote.�Yours very faithfully, "C. S. HINTON.'� I crushed the unholy thing in my hand, and burnt it in the grate. Then I fling myself on the bed, and with ay lead buried in the pillow, gave vent to the pent-up misery ot years of bitter a.nell nesd, and of the present maddening de lea t. The only words that escaped nee were, "I bate her, I bate her. Qod i I hate her." With all the enthusiasm of youth *nd inexperience 1 had counted on success. Over and over again 1 had rehearsed the scene when I was to hand over the pro feeds of my book to Aunt Emma, aud .thus lor ever rid myself of the fting of having eaten of her charity. There were other things ; but that was the goal for wrbicn 1 ran, and now the very ho (.torn h&il fAllfln nut of mv ainrld. I 

 must still wear the hateful badge of imicuteuncsa ; but at least 1 wouid get where her cold, greedy eyes could no longer gloat over my degradation. Hence tny visit to the Mecca of all weary and beavy-ladea teacher pilgrims�the Chief's office. Four years before I had written a story of twenty chapters�"Odeyne Bt. Clalr." The very name, I thought, would melt the heart of tbe flintiest editor alive. Odey ?e was fair as a lily, pure as the snow, bright as tbe sun, gentle as a dove, and (t,ut I did not realise tbat , .till long after) as spineless as a jelly fish. The bero, Lancelot Desmond, was �but what of him? It was the woe begone Odeyne wbo was to do the trick. I wrote to a woll-known editor, in quite A magnanimous tone, offering to submit my MS3. to him, and received �n answer � (ew dayo later. That very evening Odeyae took her first journey through the streets of Sydney. It was not tbe last though, by a long way, and after con siderably adding to the Government ex chequer, I sent�in sheer disgust with the world m general and editors in particu lar�tbe hapless Odeyne to tbe fats gen erally reserved for tbe emissaries of a pertain nameless gentlemen�to blazes. After tbat, if by any chance I opened the newspaper at tbe literary page, I hastily turned over tbe sheet ; but the time came wben the scales fell from my �yes, and because tbe imbecile child of my brain bad been bidden from the eye of man, 1 drew a long breath of relief, and the longing to bring forth a aeultby child took possession of me. I wrote a short sketch, and sent it fo a well-known Journalist, Paul Twy ford. with tbe request that he would tell Be whether or no I bad itfee "gilt." His answer, was* "You certainly ?too* 

 symptoms o! the cacoethes scribendl. My advice to you is, 'keep on.' '-'� I then began what I fondly called my first book, "Shadows." One hour each ulgiit, undef th� very nose of Aunt Emma, who thought I was doing school work, was devoted to "Shadows," and every morning found me eagerly waiting for the first streak of day to begin work. The precious thing was finished at last, and sent away. Dm ing the following weeks I lingered� with a wavm glow at my heart �over the Australian literature lessons. Then came the letter. CHAPTER ll.�Myself. I struggled into the world with squirming face, clenched fists, and to gasp ing cry of protest, on my father's dairy farm near, the Shoalhaveu River, ob March 18, 1891. AU that I possess of my old home is a group of mental pictures, and some ot tbe.se, no doubt, would have been lost in the shadowy past but for the fact that some incident, trivial in itself, helped to imprint them indelibly, on my childish 'brain. One very beautiful scene, for instance, might have been oblitera ted but for a hairy grub. It was in bold colours, a confusion of green, red, pink, blue, yellow, white, and purple, our flower garden, with my mother mov ing in and among the blooms, trowel in hand. I was sitting on a border of Dutch clover, munching a plppee (my baby name for a small cake), when I saw the grub crawling up the path. My shrieks of terror were hushed in that haven of refuge for toddlerdom�mother's arms. The next one was in quieter tones. The cows were being driven into the yard at 

 milking time, a long procession oi eieea, prosperous-looking bovines. Watching tbem from tae garden gate, I shouted with glee because a willy-wagtail was bavlng 4 ride on Buttercup's beck ; but Mrs. Wagtail was far too busy helping ber&elf to some of Buttercup's snort yellow hairs, to line a nest for tbe ex pected little wagtails, to acknowledge my applause. It is probably because my feeling* were more deeply involved tbat tbe Rosie* Daigy-Beauty picture stands out more vividly than tbe others. Some one bad given me a young duck, "all for my own," and having settled tbe difficult problem of namiag, by giving it mil three favourites, proceeded, with my awakened mother-love, to put my darl ing to sleep. Bitting on the back door step, with knees raised to make a good lap, I rocked backwards and forwards with so mueb earnestness tbat several times I nearly overbalanced, singing the while at the top of my voice* "Dye-bye, bj e-bye, Rosle-Dalsy-Beaut-ee, bye-bye, bye-bye, Rosie-Daisy-Beau-00-00-tee, bye bye " But Baby Duck evidently preferred to waddle across the yard than to bt soothed to sleep in daylight, for with an angry "quack, quack." she struggled out of my lap. My. outraged maternal feelings found relief in a manner, tbat soon brought Daddie and Mummle on the scene. la the nest of the group, tbe beautiful, broad Bhoalbaven sparkled in the sun. Id all the glory of a new white frock and blue sash, I was held in Daddies arms on tbe deck of a steamer, as be pointed out Pig Island, to me, I was disappointed, because I could not see big, black pigs running along tbe banks. Again, when Daddy told me to look at the inoutb of Broughton Creek, I won- 

 �ered where tbe teeth were, and later on ?y little soul was filled with amazement at "all tbe soap," which Daddie explain ed as "breakers." Tbe next picture was in sombre colours, �no several detached scenes were thrown vp on tbe large canvas. In the first, the world was full of smoke, and every one spoke of bush fires, and walked about quickly. The following one showed Dad die galloping home on black Gipsy, and calling out, "Annie, Annie, for Ood'a take go lor the Tburgates ; .the bush paddock has caught." * Soon a lot of men galloped past, and I thought it must be the races. All tbe women and girls I knew teemed to be at our place, making �cones and tea, and I laugbed at all tbe buckets of tea they carried away. Then there was a confusion of women crying, and runuing in and out of the rooms with sheets and towels, of Mummie lying �n the bed moaning, and men carrying something into the house, and my won dering if it was because it was so heavy that they looked as if they wanted to cry. Out of the confusion there seemed to come another day. The smoke had �leared, and tbe sun was shining. I liked to see all the people about the garden and in tbe bouse, and laughed at the lunny little house on wheels, with the klack pampas growing on tbe top of it, tbat stood outside the gate, and wondered vby no one would tell me what was in the long, black box, wblcb the men car ried down tbe path, and why they all followed tbe funny little house up tbe road. Cissie Thurgate carried me to the corner of the garden, and said that It was Daddic's funeral, and waa the big gest ever seen in the district. I was �o pleased because Daddie bad the big gest funeral. Jbe last ot my picture* ii ?omewaal 

 blurred. I was at the Thurgates. Cls ?ie was fastening a new 'dress on me, and told we to keep it nice and clean, because Aunt Kinma was coming to take me to Sydney, to see all the big shops. "And Muinmie, too," I asserted. But Ci6sie shook her bead. The doctors In Sydney couldn't make Muinmie better, and bo God look her to Heaven, to be with Daddie. 1 cried, because I wanted to go to (leaven, to be with Daddi� too. My earliest recollection of life�that is Buetalned recollection, without unintelli gible blanks�began in my fifth year; when Aunt Einuia told me I *was a big girl, and must go to school. It was some years later that I realised my pictures, and drew them forth from the recesses of my train, to be, In the long, grey years when I was being "brought up" by Aunt Emma, my heart's dearest treasures. So much tor who I am ; now for what. I am. I coufc?s to having views of my own on the matter, but not bearing the Imprint of a business transaction�they are not reliable. Aunt Emma, in her, anxiety to do her duty by her dead brother's child, worked herself up to the magnanimity of parting with a whole kalf-crown, in order to learn�per medium of my bumps�in what way I could test (or worst) �am my daily bread. And so, oue morning during my early teens, she presented me to a "duly Qualified prac titioner," � middle-aged man, with a black beard and a very white forehead. "Humph ! Hagh I And so you want to know what thi? young lady is most adapted for ?" passing a very eflemln ate hand over my be�d and giving me tbe creeps. * "Bhe has considerable musical and ar tistic ability." 

 A grunt from Aunt Emma. "Sne would make a good dressmaker or milliner, having method and applica tion strongly developed. She is econ omical" (a- murmur of dissent from Aunt Emma), "and would make a devoted wife and mother, and she would, ye-�s, I would) Bay she would b� * successful nurse. She is fond of approbation, and thinks a great deal more than she aays ; she is also rather hasty in temper and Judg ment, impulsive, very obliging, and apt to jump at conclusions ; fond of scenery, and Very determined, once she makes up ber mind.'* "Would she make a good teacher?" rather impatiently from Aunt Emma. "A good teacher ? Humph ) Hagb ! Yes. She is fond of children, and has the gift of imparting knowledge strongly developed. Yes, I should say she would be successful as % teacher." And so, for one halt-crown my charac ter was given, and my future settled. And vow for "the outside of the plat ter." To be strictly impartial, I will take a leaf from one ot the school exer cise books. "Describe in full � prominent citisea of Bydney. "Miss Campbell. "Miss Campbell is a prominent eittsem of Sydney. She is our teacher, and is very nice. Miss Campbell's hair does not fris like the other teacher's; 1 think it is a pity that sfae does sot put it in curling pins. She is not pretty like Miss ford, but I like the way ber face shines when she laughs. Miss Campbell has very beautiful eyes, and they look vo soft at you. Her face is somewhat pale, and there are freckles over it. I think that is all. She is rather, small and does not rouse." 

 CHAPTER 111.-Phi?. I left Sydney by tbe Tenaora mail at 8.30 one November evening (1915) for my new school. Some of my teacher friends "saw me off," and Aunt Emma did her duty too. As the train moved out of tbe station, and she was lost to view, I uttered a low, fervent "Thank God 1" The Journey was uneventful but pleasant, although the carriage was crowded., We arrived at the station where I was to disembark at 3.30 am. The spirit of the new life�with no hard faced Aunt Emma looming on the horizon �was strong within me, and I stepped out on to the badly, lighted little plat form with a light heart. A young man (the groom) came up to me and asked } "Are you the new teacher for Mutmut billy ?�� "Yes." "Have you much luggage?" "This suit case, and a trunk la the brake van." "Oh, that's to be left in the office to-night, and sent out in the waggon to-morrow. You don't want anything out of it, I suppose ?" "No. Will it be sura to go out to morrow ?" "Certain. Tbe waggon came in with the wool this evening. We'll get along DOW." I followed my guide through tbe tiny waiting room to where a coach was standing in the road. I got in, aad in less than a Quarter of an hour we 'ar rived at the" hotel. The groom unlocked a side door and brought me straight to my room., Taking a small lamp from the hall table, he handed it to me, and wished me goodnight. � . � � ? "I suppose you'll go into the parlour, lor breakfast, Miss Campbell?" 

 I bad not thought about it, but Mabel so evidently expected me to say "Yes" that I did so, and she led the way to the parlour, where three men were al ready at breakfast. AU looked up ex pectantly, and said "Good morning^' I was at once drawn into the conversation, and was surprised to be addressed as Miss Campbell, and told what a fine family* the Maxwells were. It was my first taste of the brotherhood of the bush. The eldest of the three men was a shire engineer spending a few days at* this outpost. He was a humorous, fath erly man, who conversed fluently on Egyptian architecture, the religions of the East, Australian poetry, and every other subject which his neighbour�an earne6t-faced theological student*-* brought up. He (the student) was drink ling deeply of the other man's fountain of knowledge. The third man was an accountant at the local branch of tho Commercial Bank. He had enlisted, and was going into camp the following week. He went to work immediately after breakfast, and the other two made my first morning in strange surroundings pass very pleasantly. At 11 o'clock Mabel came in to say that Maxwell's trap was coming up the road, but she supposed they'd wait for lunch now as It was so late. The men went out on to the veranda, end I looked nervously out of the Window, as the hooded buggy drew up before the front door. "Miss Campbell here?" called out the occupant, who was partly bidden by the hood, to the men on the veranda. He then drove round to the back. "It's Johnny," said the engineer com ing back to the parlour, "A" fine lad. 1 always put up there when I'm on my rounds in that part of the shire ; they 

 keep open house." "How long will it take us to get there ?" "Oh, you'll do it easily between 4 and S o'clock. It's a hot day and .... Hello I" breaiciog off as a young man came to the door, "Here we are 1 Mr. John Maxwell, Miss Campbell, better known as 'Johnny.' " Johnny Maxwell had one of the ugliest and nicest facet imaginable. He was about 19, tall, lithe, and sunburnt, and he came towards me with outstretched band. "I bet you don't Always call me Johnny," be said, turning to the engin eer after shaking hands with me. "Heavens, no I The other is too good to waste. Miss Campbell, our young friend, has a family pet name, which I, being of the family in a N sense, am per mitted to use. Shall I pass it on, Johnny ?" The boy laughed rather consciously. "Just as well to get it over." "It's Ptaia." "Phi* I" "Yes. Possibly you have read 'The Sentimental Bloke V "Oh, ye?." *'You remember the expression. 'I likes your ugly phis ?' " At the truth dawned on me, 1 had to laugh. It was io obvious, and Johnny heartily Joined io. Then I went to get my traps together, as we were to start Immediately after lunch. 1 liked my first whin of MutmutbiHy, \\To be continued.)
