 CHAPTER VII.-(Continued.) 

 As soon as Nixon,' the saddler, had got .he body in his waggon, he lost no time in setting out for the station. He was a good-natured anti feeling man in the main ; nevertheless lie inly resolved that every inch of leather that came lu contact with the dead body would be used on the Currumbede harness. Not a scrap of it would he tak<� to anv other station, much less carry home 

 with him. 

 Mr. Lesslng and Billy rode together a little behind the waggon. Billy was much excited ami somewhat frightened. The wild, superstitious nnture lie in- herited from a long line of dusky an- cestors was perturbed ; nor did it ap- pear that his Chinese father had en- dowed his offspring with any of the Oriental phlegm. The eyes in his dark face were bulging, and seemed to be nearly all whites. Mr. Lesslng, on the contrary, seemed the same as ever. Whatever his thoughts were, the mask like fitce did not reveal them. He was as taciturn as ever, only breaking the silence twice-once by remarking, " It was curiong your finding Mr. Hope's whip beside Master Charles," and the second time by saying, " Doesn't Mr. Hope appear to be hurrying oh the funeral ? Is such haste really re- quired ?" 

 When they readied the homo paddock, Mr. Lesslng sa.d he would ride on and prepare Miss Summers for what had happened, aud left Billy and Nixon lo follow at a slower paee. 

 Miss Jane was in the sitting-room when he arrived. r " My dear Miss Sum- men�. I am the bearer of very bad news." 

 " Something has happened to Char- lie !" she exclaimed. 

 " Yes." 

 The poor lady put her hand to her heart as if she would faint, and, sinking on a chair, asked in a dry-tougued voice. " Has he been thrown from his horse �" 

 "No. The sun." 

 " Ah." The sound was something be- tween an exclamation and a sob. 

 " The poor fellow has had a sunstroke, and I fear he will not recover." 

 " He is dead." 

 "Yes, Miss Summers, it would be cruel to prolong your" agony. I can hear the wheels of the waggon at the gate. He is dead." 

 Then he left her, and went to help Nixon and Billy to bear Charlie's body 

 to his bedroom. 

 While they Btood by the bed, Miss Jane entered, and, with a cry of "Oh, Charlie, Charlie !" flung her arms round hi� neck, and wept as if her heart would 

 break. 

 Nixon wiped the perspiration from his

 fat sallow face with the sleeve of his coat, and after a minute's thought he said, " The best thine I can �"� is to drive back to town. Jason, the car- penter, was sober when I left to-day, and if he work all night I shall be able to be back by sunrise to-morrow with the-the box. Come along, Bill, and give me a hand to get the things out of the waggon," and the two men left 

 the room. 

 When they were, gone, Mr. Lessing said, " I will not attempt to console you, Miss Summers, but I am anxious to help you. If you will go to your room, and take the rest that your nerves require, I will do anything that is needed to prepare poor Charles for his 

 burial." 

 "O* no, no, Mr. Lessing. I would not let anyone touch him except myeelf. Please go away and leave us." 

 Without' saying anything more he 

 obeyed her. 

 Two hours later Miss Summers came to him. " There is one thing you could do for me, Mr. Lessing. I would like to have Charlie shaved. He did not shave this morning. I do not know how to do it." 

 " Certainly, Miss Summers ; if you get some, hot water I will do it for you," Mr. Lessing answered ; and getting a razor and the water they went together to the room. 

 It was now dusk, and a candle was burning at the head of the bed. The clothes which the dead man had worn at the fire had been changed for'white linen ; the eheet came up to his breast, and his arms lay by his side. 

 He had been washed, and every trace of blackness got by working at the fire had been removed. Miss Jane put a towel round his neck to save the shirt and white �ilk tie, in which she had dressed him, and, taking the candle, held it so as to give Lessing the best light for his work. In a few minutes one side of the dead face was covered with lather, and Lessing, taking up the razor, was about to use it, when, all at once, the ghastllness of the office seemed to strike him. A fit of trembling took hold of him, his hand shaking, so that for more than a minute he could not pioceed with his task. There seemed to be something awful, something gro- tesquely horrible, about the white face, wich the foam covering one cheek. Then, with a great effort, he recovered his nerve, and as quickly as possible finished what he had to do. As soon as he was done, Miss Jane sponged and dried the dead man's face, and removed the towel from his breast. " Poor boy, my poor boy," she eald, " ki he not beautiful ? When I was brushing his hair I found a little bruise here, on his right temple. I suppose he must have got it when he fell." 

 "Yes," Mr. Lessing replied, "or lie may have received it after his death, when we placed him in the waggon, or on the way home ; the road is uneven in places. Where will he be interred, 

 Miss Summers V" 

 " His mother is burled in the Nande- war Cemetery : I expect that my brother will bury lum beside her." Here Mis�? Jane, who had restrained her grief whllu there was work to be done, broke down again. 

 .' Pardon my troubling you, Mies Sum- mers, but, as your brother is not here, fchould we not send a messenger to the town wich instructions for the grave to be got ready ?, I confess I forgot about the necessity of this till after Nixon had gone." " 

 Poor Miss Jane dried her eye�? again, and �aid, " Yes,,I must see to it." 

 " If you allow me, I will go and find Billy, and tell him what is required of him, and you can write a short note to the proper persons in the township, and he eau start with it at once. I am sorry that, being a stranger, I cannot attend to the matter myself, and save you all the trouble." 

 '.Thank you, Mr. Lessing, I will go and write the note at once." 

 In another hour, in the starlit night, the half-caste was riding with the letter, which would Insure' that by daylight the next morning'men would be busy opening the burying-place of the Sum- mers fatally. >, 

 Now. all tbi* time Keith Hope had 

 been pushing on at the top of his horse's speed to reach Almyr's. As it was, the euii had been set some time, and the only light was that of the stars when he arrived there. The servant who showed him into the drawing-room told him that the family was still-at dinner, and went with his message that he wished to see Mr. Summons at once. While she waa going, Keith could hear a peal of merri- ment coming from the dining-room, in which he could easily distinguish Mr. Sumrnors's jovial laugh, and, with a lover's imagination, ho fancied lie could also detect that of Ella. 'The ,�ound wrung his heart. Why had fate or- dained that he, who loved her as no one elpo in the world could, should be the one to deliver to her such heavy tiding.? as those he bore. This feeling was so expressed on his face that when Mi-. Summers entered ti moment later and looked at him, the joke ho was about to make died on his tongue, and he said at once, in an anxious voice : 

 " Nothing wrong, is there, Hope ?" 

 " Yes, Mr. Summers. I am the bearer of very bad nowa Charlie has got sun- 

 stroke." 

 " Is he ill ?" 

 " Ile is dead." > 

 Keith never cared to talk about this scene. He told me once that the ten minutes that followed were the worst ever ho spent irt lils life. Mr. Summers seemed to be stunned. He eat down on a chair, and stared straight in front of liim with vacant eyes. At last, to rouse him, Keith said, " Had we not better let Miss Almyr know, and get her to tell 

 Ella ?" 

 Mr. Summers did not appear to hear him. Keith went to the door, and called-" Mips Almyr, may I see you, please, for a minute ?" 

 With the quick intuition which' so many women possess, Ella guessed that 

 there was something wrong, and carne with her friend. Ae soon as she saw Mr. Summers, she said, "Oh, I know something terrible has happened. Tell me what it is, father." Mr. Summers looked at her for a moment with dull eyes, as if he did not recognise her, and then turned his face away again. He did not speak. 

 For a minute they remained so, the man sitting staving vacantly, and the beautiful girl standing beside him, her large blue eyes dilated with terror at some unknown calamity ; and then Keith could not bear io see her suffer so any longer. He crossed the room, and very gently took her hand. 

 " Ella, dearest, be brave," he said ; and then, by a happy inspiration, ho added, "Be brave for your father's sake." * 

 The poor girl made an effort to calm herself, but did not speak. 

 " It has been dreadfully hot to-day, Ella, and there was a bush fire on Currumbede. Charlie went to put it out, and he worked too hard." 

 . Keith paused. The girl was listen- ing attentively. The little hand he held grew firm, as if every muscle were being braced to meet the coming shock. 

 " Owing to the heat he took very ill." Again he paused. How could he bring himself to say the awful word he was approaching ? He hesitated so long that Ella looked in his face, and then looked at her father, and- she knew the truth. Keith and she were stand- ing close together. She said nothing, asked for no details ; but, as naturally as if Hope had been her accepted lover for years, she drew closer to him, and, resting her head on his shoulder, cried as if her heart would break. 

 Keith stood with his arms round the weeping girl, and for a time did not try Jo comfort her. He felt that the tears^she was shedding wove easing her heart, and that silent sympathy was the best thing he could give ber. He was more than half-ashamed that at such a moment the thought of his own good for- tune should obtrude itself. The crisis had made Ella know her own heart. She loved him. The woman who was all the world and �11 his life to him was his at last. 

 Meanwhile, ML�s Alniyr had slipped quietly from the room to tell her father of Charlie Summons's death. Half-an hour later, when he came to the draw- ing-room, he found Ella sitting beside Keith, listening to all he could tell her about her brother. Mr. Summers had not changed his position. Mr. Almyr went up to him, and, laying his hand on his shoulder, said, " I am awfully sorry for you, old man." The touch seemed to bring him to himself. 

 Mr. Almyr took him back to the dining-room, and poured out a glass of whisky for him, which he drank at once. "I must go li�me now. Can you let the man run up the buggy horses ?" he asked. . 

 '. It will be a bad night for driving through the bush." Mr. Almvr said.

 " Would it not do if you started first thing in the morning ?" 

 " No, I must go at once. Tell Ella to get ready." 

 Gerty took her father on one side. " It 

 would be a shame Jo let Ella venture out at this hour ofvthe night. There is no 

 moon. Let one of the men ride with Mr. Summers, and Mr. Hope can drive Ella to Currumbede early to-morrow morning." 

 Mr. Almyr readily saw the common sense of this proposal, and easily per- suaded Mr. Summers, whose one Idea was to get home to his dead son, to accede to it. 

 I will not delay to describe Mr. Sum- mers'� ride through the darkness, nor harrow your feelings with the account of h's grief, as ho spent what remained of the night beside the bed on which Charlie lay for the last time. Very, early in the morning, Nixon drove into the yard with the. coffin ; and without any loss of time the body was placed in it, and the funeral shortly afterwards started for Nandewar.
