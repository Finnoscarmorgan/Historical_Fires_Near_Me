 CUT OFF FROM THEWORLD. 

 By PRANK T. BULLEN, Author of 'The Cruise of the 'Cachalot,' ' &c. 

 CHAPTER XVTIL� iTW-imiwU 

 -.Three times the Meeanee rose and fell be fore those monstrous waves, and when sue emerged at the last she was as nearly a wreck as any ship's repairer would wish to see. There was practically nothing left of her but the bare hull; even her stalwart funnel was crushed into a disreputable former caricature of itself. But then calm supervened. The brilliant stars, which had shone down serenely upon the desperate struggle as they would upon the elimina tion of the world, saw her battered hulk 

 still floating, but helplessly, her engines stilled because her fires were out. Of the host of trim fittings thai abound upon tue deck of such a ship when in ordinary trim only a few twisted stanchions and splin tered fragments remained. Even the bridge, whereon Jemmy, his second officer, quar ter-master, and the sea cunaie still clung, staggered drunkenly on about ciie-ihird ol He supports .is rl;e 'icioriius ship railed gently to the slight swell. 'Come, Charlton,' cried Jemmy to his second officer, 'and you, quarter-master, we must see how we stand. Blow your whistle, Ckarlcon, for the watch, that will tell how many of them are left. And you, Joe, Jump forward, and see what they are like in the forecastle.' The wliistle rang out vpon the still night aw. and wax pr-isenily responded to by four out of twenty hag gard, trembling wretches that had been spared, and as they stood before their offi; cers in the dark there came crawling up from below a few of the fire gang and one engineer. He could hardly speak, but managed to convey to Jemmy the informa tion that the stokehold was full of water, that two-thirds of his men were dead of the sudden outburst of steam upon the inrush, water, and that he knew nothing of the en gineers that were off duty. 'Pull yourself together, Kinstra,' said the skipper kindly. 'See if you can find the chief and the watch below. And get steam on the donkey as soon as you can. ko that you can pump her out. She's all right, you know, only shipped a tremendous lot of water. Now be off with you� there's a good chap.' Kinstra drew his hand wearily- across his brow, made a great ef fort and disappeared, while Jemmy and Charlton descended to the saloon to see about the passengers. See, did 1 say? AlaM that was what they could not do, for the great apartment was' in utter darkness, owing to the failure of the electric light. Instantly, Jemmy cried, 'Now come on, Charlton, the lamp-room. All our lights are out. We must hoist the ''not under control' lights first, or we may have the final stroke delivered if anything's under way near us.' On deck agaiu to find a motley crowd awaiting orders. 'You there, chief?' roared Jemmy. 'Ay, aajn here,' growled the sturdy Scot, 'by the blessin' o' Goed. Aanx juist col leckin' a few men tae mak a start wi' lights an* pumpin' first. The main engines can wait. I sh'd think. Yes. I'll see to tinner,' 

 and he disappeared. Gradually the terrified Lascars became as sured that all was not over and that their duties still remained. . Those unreasonable sahibs who would persist in fighting against fate were after them with strong cryings and occasional violence, for it was time to | forget prudence in these things. Where fore, before very long, Jemmy and a gang of shivering stewards were down in the saloon with lamps held high and some idea of the desolation could be gained. It was a scene hardly to be' described. The water that had wrought tbc ruin had all drained away, leaving the wreckage not merely from the tables out of the humans that had been seated at them. They were apparently piled in heaps, clinging together many beyond fear or reason, others dully resigned to their fate, but none apparently had any idea of hope left to them. One swift and comprehensive glance around, and Jemmy raised his strong, clear voice. 'Come, ladies and gentlemen, all the dan ger is over. The ship is still afloat and likely to remain so. Please try and get Jo your cabins. There is no more danger, assure you.' ? There was a movement among the sodden groups a babble of querulous voices, and then the stewards, by sheer force of habit, irent among the temporarily distracted folk and began to look out their own particular Charges in order to conduct them to their cabins. Meanwhile ? Jemmy stood like a tower, uttering cheerful words, and by some instinct repeating again and again, as one does to a terrified child, 'It's all right, there's no danger now, not the least in the world. Don't be alarmed, don't worry,' 

 and to on. And gradually, a; the limp forms struggled to tneir feet aim! doubttui-y crept away in the dim light from the. Ian- : terns, under the guidance of tue stewaids, they recovered- cbnnaeiice, even1 feeung � quite uncalled-for sense ol shame tnat ihey suould have been so utterly demoralised by ? fear. .. Returning on deck Jemmy found, to his intense relief, that' not one of fa.s pincers or engineers had been taken from him. A' good many Asiatics were gone � how many could not be known yet, and it did not seem to mat ter very much, cold-blooded as the assertion may read, for it is an axiom among those j who have to deal with Eastern laces that. I with the exception of the wondea'ui '. Japanese, they dread suffering a_ great deal but death not at all, and therefore it seems i impossible to regard their destruction in the! same light as that of our fellow-country- j men and women. j Down below the chief engineer and his fellows had been toiling to such good pur-'j pose that already the steam was rising in: the donkey boiler, and so all that couid be done was to move cautiously, not.ng the damage, meanwhile fervently wishing, as seameu do under all circumstances, for the ' blessed light of day. In order not to waste ? time Jemmy gathered all his officers into his cabin whicn, from its position, high on , the bridge deck, had escaped the general j ruin, and there producing a' comforting; glass, which he usually kept for pilots, &c, '- he congratulated them and himself on being alive. 'I think,' he said, 'that there must have been an earthquake of enormous violence somewhere beneath us which threw up those immense waves. Some fools will call them tidal waves, but we know that in the sense those words are popularly used there is nothing of the sort. We met those waves end on. four or five mighty hills of water, raised by the upheaval of the sea-bed, and if this ship hadn't been of the finest pos sible construction, and her fittings worthy of the splendid yard she came from, she would by now have been just a place for the sBa-poople to play in and rejoice over the plentiful feast provided for them by whatever gods they understand. We. at any rate, have every reason to feel glad that we are still alive. 1 don't know how the passengers are, but I hope none of the ladies will die of the shock. 'Now, boys, get to your bunks all of you except who ryer has got the watch We can do nothing , till daylight, and very little then I think� the present business is for the engineers, not us. Call me if there's any need� I don t suppose- there will be� and all hands at daylieht. Long before day dawned the indefatigable engineers had got her pumped out and tno dynamo working, so that she was well lit again in every part, and when the golden stream of the new day came Haunting across the sky a dense black column of smoke, arising from the muck c'amaged funnel, told all 4he suWound.ng sky tuat the .Meeanee was rapidly gett.n* under way again. All hands were Epeedily astir, but very little could be done except to secure portions of the upper works that were ready to fall, and t0 chop and tear away other portions that were hopeless. The roll of the crew was called, and it was found that twenty-six of | them were missing and dead. The latter ) were reverently disposed of, and then, ! pending the snip being restored to her full speed, Jemmy, with his officers, turned his attention to his passengers. . Already, by the labors of the reassured waiters, the saloon had been restored to its normal appearance, and. as one by one the ladies and gentlemen came on deck the officers met them with smiling faces. It took some little time to explain to them what really had happened, for by some amazing vagary of the brain the average passenger, no matter what his experience, has the most absurd notions of sea conditions of the most ordinary type. I 'dare not bur den my pages wich the banalities I have beard retailed to passengers in reply to their infantile questions, I can only re peat that the average passenger, no mat ter how old a hand, knows practically -no more than the latest griffin, and it ia utterly absurd to expect him to understand any reasonable explanation you may offer. What, however, did excite Jemmy's ire was that he suddenly observed the ten dency to attribute what the passengers were pleased to call their miraculous de liverance to him. He heard phrases ?dropped of 'noble conduct, coolness in tho presence of awful danger, ability of the highest order,', and. so on, until the night beiore they were due at the Sand Heads all culminated in a request to him to be present at a meeting in the saloon after dinner. Backed by all the principal pas sengers he could not excuse himself and so the meeting came off. To his horror an address was read, couched in terms of the most .fulsome flattery ^ to himself, a little praise, given to his officers, and a few decorous words of condolence also were distributed to the manes of the dead Asia tics. ? He listened in utmost discomfort, almost consternation, as the well-rounded sen tences^poured forth, and as soon as ever the cheers had subsided he sprang to his feet, his face aflame, - and cried, ?'Ladies and gentlemen, if all you have said of me had been true the conclusions you have drawn would have been too flit tering. But, unconsciously, what you have said is all wrong. The ship was struck by a succession of earthquake waves which reduced her to a wreck and nearly sunk her. In that dread hour I was as helpless as that young lady there, except that my natural instinct caused me to make for the' bridge. I did! nothing because I could not do anything.- You might all have been drowned in the saloon for all the help I could give you. As far as doing is concerned the chief engineer is the hero, the man 'who wnnt doTvn in the midst of that chamber of horrors, the engine-room and stokehold; and got her going. If anyone deserves patting on the back it is he, it is certainly not me. Please don't do it, I beg of you^ I may be worthy of your admiration, I hope I am, but I haven't been called upon to prove it yet, so let it wait.' To Jemmy's surprise, after a dead silence of a few seconds, the cheers rose in greater volumes than ever, for ordi narily tho world takes a man at his own valuation. The exceptions are cases of this kind, where perfectly sincere disclaimers are set down as heroic modesty, &c. The only alteration made was that ilackenzie, the chief engineer, was dragged from his work, growling and refusing, with many bad ?words, to take any part in. the proceedings beyond having a stiff glass of his native beverage. And then the meeting broke up. Jemmy sneaking off in order to avoid pri vate congratulations and hoping to gain hie cabin unaecosted. In vain ft gentle hand arrested him, a tearful voice, bade him stay just a. minute, and Miss Vivien, the civic, thp flirt, the runagate, practically cast Jier self at hi8 feet. For a moment Jemmy wae nonplussed, but he had grown very rapidly this passage, and, recovering himself,, he whispered, 'Ooino to my cabin, 1 will send mv bat for 

 yon.' ' She sHranfc lacirand *!2owe-r 'Hitf to^o..He.riia�t-ned4o:iiis bertli, suinmoned hie bey, and instructed him, then sat down and waited,, quite., -jaimly-ewr .whet wouli .happen.. In ten minutes the boy/reappeared, conducting Miss Vivieii; ?whom he invited to recline on his settee. The boy set the door wide on the outer hook and waited, according to his , instructions.^ (Presently coffee, Jiqueur, and iigareiftes appeared, ..?*�.; all of which Miss Vivien was partial, and in the meantime there flowed \\ra /steady' stream of explanation from ' Jemmy -utterls - intelligible to the boy. . . i What sort ci -refined torture .it inflicted; upon Miss Vivien it'is impossible to say, but it must have been hard to bear, because at last sne gasped, 'Is it necessary, to have this black man as a -witness?' ? 'Quite,' blandly replied Jemmy. 'At pre sent I am prepared for anything, even Iot meeting my wue td-niorrow. night, and . 1 do not propose to be caught. My dear M�s3 Vivien, you are a reckless young lady, who, like the majority of your sex, does not look aflead. You would lead a man to do wnat he would hate himself for, and then call him a ecoundTel for doing it. You woiul tempt me to ruin my career, not caring about yourself in the present gratification of youa j senses and I am absomteiy proof against your blandishments. I was caught once, for life, but it won't happen again, even it she who caught me were to die.' In thus speaking he was transformed. He looked totally evil as he felt the utmost con tempt for the beautiful animal before him. and in his heart, there arose & feeiirig of exultation that he was able thus to pre serve his honor, for well he knew that -bad it not been for his feeling of honor the knowledge of the penalty attaching to such behaviour as he had been tempted to, when found out, would hot have deterred him for : one moment, and she literally crept away. The 'greeting given to Jemmy the next ! morning by the pilot at the Sands Heads was a cheery one.. The great man said that some dim news had reached them oi j disaster resulting from an, awful -wave, but' everything was indefinite. u.e, aowevei i (Jemmy) was the first to bring any definite ! news, and as there was an uneasy feeiing all round the ports of the Bay of Bengal hr was certainto be assailed on every hand for information. In reply Jenimiv 'rave hiir a succint account of the disaster, and told him that his report was all ready for the newspaper men. Then they relapsed into ordinary seafaring talk, until the pilot, �ud denly stopping in his tramp athwart tne bridge, said: � 'Beg yer pardon, I'm sure, j captain. I've got a. private letter for ye) put into my hand with a 10-rupee note by a peon at tne office yesterday morning, and before I had time to turn round he wai gone. Tho swine, did he take me for a postman ?' With a shaking hand Jeinm}' tore open I the envelope and read: � '? 'My one man in all the world, my hus band, I wait for you. Long, long have been the hours, but heavenly the promise of re. ward. I hear you have been in danger^ j Pah! you are always in danger. I do not ' care for your danger, I only caTe for your love; the danger of loving, that is all' the trouble I have. I am starving for you, beloved, my one object here' on earth, my soul, my life, everything. I shall be wait ing on the pier for the ship; whether it be day or night can make no difference to your humble slave.� Your wife a � , ' ii'LENA.' A thousand sensations raced across Jemmy's mind as he read this letter. They cannot be assorted. But in the chief event they resolved themselves into a great satisfaction that he had been true to her in fact, if not in mind. His inner man warned him that thie was but a poor con solation, yet another voice whispered that it was due to his innate goodness that he had tliis satisfaction. And so, half ashamed and half-exultant, he awaited the meeting with his wife. CHAPTER XIX. As the Meeanee was skilfully -guided in alongside of the company's wharf Jemmy, on the bridge by the pilot, saw a lonely figure standing well out of the sun's glare and remote from the odoriferous crowd of coolies and Babus, as well as from the groups of white, friends of the incoming pas sengers. And he Was conscious of an ac celerated heart-beat, a decided /sense of de votion of his whole immaterial being. After all, she was his wife, had been to him what no other woman had, and her only fault was that she loved him beyond all reason and cared nothing for anybody whom she thought might possibly- come between her and her one object in. life. He wae not sufficiently versed in psychology to know that it was merely the physical side of him overwhelming the mental, and that the ar. gument would disappear as suddenly as it came, shortly after their meeting. | But there it was now, and so full armed that his lip curled with something very like contempt aa he surveyed the clustering groups of women beneath him, scarcely any of whom, he knew full well, would give any similar cause of complaint (o their husbands as Elena had to him. And, con sequently, whenever one of them caught hie eye he smiled a amile of serene aloof ness, perfectly maddening to its recipient, but exactly expressing his contempt for her. Then his boy brought him a chit, which read: � 'I am in your cabin � come to me soon, dear.� ELENA.' Waving his hand in diKmfesal to the boy, and muttering 'Aehcha,' he waited a minute or so until assured that the yhip was all right, then descended the bridga ladder with a steady, foot but whir!iiij� brain. It was but a step or two to hie' cabin, and tliere, radiant, glowing, glorious in her perfect beauty, sat his wife. Hhu sprang at him as he entered, pushing a#de the chick at the door, as a mother at her (Jiild from whom she had been parted lov a long while. At last he said:� 'Elena, darling, you muet let up on me for e. time. There are lots of people coming� you see how we are, just escaped ifrom the very jaws of death, and the ship n wreck. Do be reasonable.' She released him, replumed herself, ae it seemed to hum, by an instaiitarieoiiB jerk of her head, lay back on the settee a la. grande dnine, and murmured, 'I am ready for them.' And they came, oh, yen, th-.!jl~ arrived, not in ranjle spies but battalion-*. They -were of all peoples, nations, and lan guages and very, soon Jemmy had to cry, ?'Hold, enough. An imperative necessity ?was kid upon him to -bid farewell to als ft roughly, one job of it in the saloon, .So after issuing his orders and dismissing with abundant contumely the inotliM throng that crowded hia door, while tho assistant manager sat by Mrs. Tenison on the settee and wondered why his fwr-f amea manner with ladies seemed to have no at traction for her, he said to Elena.� 'Com--1, dear, we must face the music. Come and sit by my side while I bid fare well to my late passt'ngers, it will be a little recreation for you.' . , ,, . Down into the saioon ihey fared, their entry being the signal for uproarious ap 

 platt from the gentlemen.' They' td�& . tb*ir allotted Iseats, and tho assistant -man-, ager rose in glory. 'Ladies and gentle-. rm&n.J'1,lae:m4i.'faa the representative .of the company yo-i have honored by youv patronage I am, of course, uware how pre cioua time is to most or us. The comj ay. { is deeply appreciative of ycur desire to bid farewell to its: inost capable commander, ^Captain James Tenison,, and he ib hvre to thank.yoirfor the honor yp& do; him. Tin proceedings must be ae. brief- as poasibhV-in I order not to waste i yqUt-Hiwu.'.' - | AU the whole everjrfc, .among the j women, was,; fixed ^-n Mi*. Tenison, mfew tiilly . assessing lier -end 'gloiinng, with 'nip pressed wratfii-*: Who .wsBlshe. aud- how dare he keep from the knowledge of r -wholo ship's company of women that he was a married man? It was an outrage, nothing less, but with feminine inc-orieequenee thiy felt no lesentment against him, only hatred for the -innocent cause of . his ' duplicity. Every man, on the other hand, was busy admiring Elena, and if he thought of ' Jemmy at all it was merely to dism-ss him j with a semi-contemptuous 'lucky beggar' and return to the study -of thu amazingly ! beautiful women before him.. It was aj curious and instructive spectacle. ' I There mre the usual speeches marked by ; nothing but inability to utter tue thbug^is ?which filled each speaker as he rose, the usual absurd proposing und 6eccudmg, but at last Jemmy got his chance. He said � 'Ladies and gentlemen, men -who man*.;* shins upon the sea jnust take care of their freight or they can't get on. It may hurt your feelings to know it, but iny duty would compel mo to take as much -care, as j far as their lives Avere concerned, of a cargo of cattle as-of a cargo of men ami women, and I should do it as a matte*, -if ?business, All your talk about -heroes leaves ' me perfectly. cold. I firmly believe thai there is not one master of all the thousands aflout in our service who wouldn't do just tho sam5 as I have -done and for the same reason� because it was his duty. '' : 'Of course, it is very nice to hear you say such pretty things about me � it's too! nice, in fact� and if a' fellow isn't careful ' it's apt to give:him a swollen head, whicn I hone I am not likely to get. However, j I thank you with all my heart for your kind words and your good wishes, and so does my -wife here, who has come from England to join me and i� greeted by inis extraordinary news about her husband.' Thure were different expressions in all tne t-yos inw They In', as \\ou know, been fixed upon, the brilliant beauty even ?while her husband was speaking, the men's with intense appreciation, the women's with keenest criticism and, in many cases. Bearcely-vered dislike. Now the male eyes ! showed disappointment in that she waa hardly fair game, ancL moreover, heavily handicapped Decause she was the property of a hero, while the women, \\vith_ their elementary notions of justice to their own ? sex, saw in her only one who had sup- j planted them, and or whom Captain Teni- ! son had doubtless been thinking all the ; while hP had been flirting with them so j vigorously .They saw it all now; not a word or act of his could be taken hold of I us meaning anything serious, for it was ob- I viou-. that he loved this bold-eyed, foreign looking woman, probably 'was in real spin, tual bondage to ner. Oh, they hated her very much indeed. She knew it well, saw it gleam in their hayd eyes, and tri umphed accordingly. It was her hour, and she felt that it was worth much struggle and privation to arrive at it as she had done. The function did not last long, and very few of his late passengers, especially among the ladies, lingered to bid him good-bye I personally, circumstances noted by Elena' j ! with intense satisfaction. But sue saw j little of him afterwards throughout the day, for he was in constant demand. A host of people had to be seen upon most im portant matters, and although they were all as studiously polite to Elena as the Anglo-Indian is noted for being to his womankind, it waa obvious that they con sidered her rather in tlie way, especially the superior officials of the company, who, ?while full of satisfaction at the way in which their ship had acquitted herself, and i foreseeing much profit accruing from the advertisement the affair would surely give them, were not at all pleased to see the captain's wife so much in evidence, and al though they said no word about it gave unmistakable signs of theiv dissatisfaction. At last thp long day was over and Jemmy was free to accompany his wife to the -home she had ready for him. the more or less comfortable flat in a huge building overlooking the Maidan, which she had occupied since her arrival, having taken it on account of her former expe riences at the hotel. They spoke little during the long drive from the ship, but when the gharry bad been dismissed, and the khitnmtgar had received his orders about dinner, being left alone, Jemmy sank | beside his wife on the sofa, _ murmuring. I 'Well, this Joes seem homelike, dear; so ' thoughtful of you. too. But I'm afraid it ; will t-e very lonely for you while s I am a-way. a? I know you don't make many friends.' Very gently she turned her eyes upon him, imperceptibly her arms tightened I round his neck, as she replied, 'My love, j you and I are not going to be parted any more, except by death. My place is witn you, near you, and that place I'll keep at whatever cost. I'll be no burden to you �I won't, indeed � but I must be with you. If you only knew the hell in which I have been living since last I saw your lovely face you would feel for me as I am sure vou do not now. Whatever God rules our lives and exacts punishment for what He considers we do wrong must be satisfied \\ with my sufferings whatever I have done, or may'do, againet His will. I have onlv lived on because of hope � hope now ful filled�and I can only live now by being satisfied in my one desire. And I will live, I -will be near you, unless you kill me, and surely you can't do that. Ob, my love, my love!' ? To this Jemmy listened in a sort of stupid rage. He knew he loved this beau tiful woman, but, -what in the name of all the gods in ihe pantheon of the worlds was he to do with her?� a creature of one idea, and that idea fatal to all his ideas of ?work and /ljfe. Just then the ascent of the servants, bringing the table gear, in preparation for dinner, relieved him a little, and his whirling thoughts broadened out into a calmer view of the situation. He recalled the many, times when difficult and painful situation in which he had neces sarily been placed during the performance of his duty had glided or gritted away, and he thought, 'By such and such a time I should- have forgotten all about this,' or, 'I have only got to . hold on and this will soon be over. Then I shall wonder why I thought eo much of it at the time,' and he became quite cheer ful. Indeed, th; meal was a pleasant one for Elena was in her happiest mood, and he had .flung care for the future to the four winds and determined to enjoy himself in the present, as he had every right to do. j Consequently.. that evening ranged among; 

 the j)leaB�ntest of l&ilife; all i�T'|li!�M Banter, undoalitelli^ (e&tee t-f ibe.wtin drop' lingering at the bottom �f tkef �u$ . He heard rail the news of.the Jobb �J % first-born, which, inadt him wo�dcr cart ously what he should 4�ve felt 3ike'a&a , Sather, and felt a dull ache at h� -' heart) hiard of J;be frivolity �f ihe Cav&Kera without the least' surprise, for he remeu* bered vividly the many questionable stc/iet told him, and. hints given him by tlie giddy old chap. ? . . �?--'?? However, he was swayed entirely byJjJS^ mood of his wife, .who wob evidently oetm. mined to ignore all -of tho past thirt :'S�� any paint in it. and in this frame he pe- siatcd during the -whole of his stay in Cal cutta. It was rather longer than usual, owing to the necessity for repairs, but they were made urgent in order to avoid sens ing a hired ship. So the tune rushed on until the day before sailing arrived. NoW Jemmy felt it incumbent opon him to face the difficulty which he knew to be fan pending, but had ignored, in order that he. might bo happy as long as possible. So that day when he came home to the cosy flat, after dinner had been cleared away, he said to his -wife, as calmly as Jl he knew she would agree with him, 'Well, darling, I shall have to bid you good-bv* to-morrow for another three months nearly. Never mind, the time will soon slip away1) especially it you make a few friends to fco about a bit� ^it's such a mistake to coon yourself up indoors, especially in Cat cutta.' She listened quietly until he had finished1, and then said gently, 'I thought you understood that I' was going with you. I booked my passage a fortnight ago undeft my own name, Mrs. Tenison. ond thj� Babu never noticed. How could you ima gine, after what has happened, that I would leave you again?' * . The man buried his face in his bands and groaned, for he recognised the finality, in the tone, saw how helpless he vas in the face of such a will as hers. A- -1 then he determined upon a big bluff. Pulling himself together he said, in as quiet a tone as her own, 'Very well, then 1 resign my position to-morrow morning. I will not endure as skipper what 1 have as mate, and worse.' 'That wiil be delightful,' the replied, with immense pleasure in her voice. 'I shall have you all to myself altogether then.' It was the last straw. Jemmy sprang to his feet, and glaring down at his wife, cried, 'Woman, haven t you got any de cency, any soul, no idea' of what belong* to life? I know you preUy well, hut surely there is somewhere about you a spark of decent feeling, something that would hate the idea of a man liko ?ne Icing turned into a pampered lapdog.' Quite deliberately she turned -o him aud said, ''Husband, if it were mine to choose between the highest place on earth and only occasional separation from you, and rags, hunger, and a hovel, with you always by my side, I should have not a moment's hesitation in choosing. Nothing on earth, counts but you. Where you arc there I. must and will be. What you think of me, or what you feel, doesn't matter. I want you, and you alone. I won't worry you any more than I can help. I'D be the quietest person on the Bhip, but, my love, if you go to sea in any ship, there I will be. Hookum hai!' (It is an order.) Jemmy was beaten and he knew it. H� was too much of a man to waste his tiaw in fruitless wishing that this tiling nad never been, and was ako too wise not to know that against a monomania of the kin A possessing his wife any decent man must struggle in vain, so he said not another | word, but went to bed. resigned to the in evitable. You may know what else M ought to have done, but I confess, afle* considerable experience, that I do no*. What I do know is that the Meeanee sailed again the next day with a full list of pau sengers. and that Mrs. Tenison 6at nearly at the bottom of the captain's table at tho first meal, being placed there by the second steward on her personal application. To Jemmy's intense satisfaction the wear ther across the bay was very bad, and from the time they left the Sands Heads to. Ele phant Point few but the most seasoned voyagers made their appearance at meals. Also, having interviewed the chief steward and the doctor upon the subject, no word was mentioned of the curious fact that th� captain's wife was on board as a passengen and that they never spoke. But somehow it leaked out, as such matters will on boawt the best-conducted ship, the result being that Mrs. Tenfeon was left severely alone, and so was the captain, all torts of b)am� being apportioned to her and none to him. For when people on board ship get hold of a mystery they rapidly invent facts to support it. Therefore, except for Hie constant discus sion and re-embellishing of the mysteriou* story, she was a dull ship. The glooming female that was always in her accustomed place at meals and never spoke % word, tiii smart captain, who always had a pleasant smile and a ready answer for all who od dressed him, but was always in a most des perate hurry to get on to the bridge again^ would have provided conversation for tba passengers of a Lusitania. But still theflj was a distinct sense of grievance. All first class passengers of more thau one vayaga feel a sort of proprietary right in the cap tain, and resent being deprived of it under any pretext whatever. And they are apt to show that mentment in ways well un derstood and dreaded by the ofnoia's at headquarters. How Elena endured her position Wflfl it miracle. Only by the inspiring, force of, an all-absorbing love could she haVo deme 80, She lived from meal to meal on the WpS of seeing her husband's face, but speak 10 her he never did. ' Never once did he take the slightest notice or appear to know thai' she was on board. No one ever spoke to, her except the servants, to whom she re plied in Hindustani, always very gently ana courteously, so that the Kala Mcm&ihib, as they palled her, from her invariable habit of dressing in black, was attended as if tube had been a princess in her own right. Then suddenly there sprang up a rumoi that this lonely, silent woman with tho inscrutable face and smouldering eyefi was the captain's unloved, cruelly-enlreateq wife- It went round about the ship like a} bush fire in the summer, and but that thi Bhip was -then steaming up the inland sea of Japan, on the last stage of her outward journey, heaven knows what -would have happened. As it was there came an entire revulsion of feeling towards her, and th-$ whole passenger list vied with one nnothe* in their attempts to be courteous to her, and incidentally^ (though that, of course, was never in their mind) to get her version of the story.

'\\ ' She was totally unprepared for the spd jkn glint of fury in Elena's ntually *l*$-y- (ooking eyea, or the sibilant voi2e*.wi'h ?which she refilled, 'you hateful, raodlle sonie old wonStn, go' and neglect your poor husband; it will be the best thing- for his tmppiness that you have done idnce you jbairied him?' ' Poor, wclMritentfoned lady. She was as �no who suddenly falls headlong and un prepared into icy cold water, and when the had recovered ber breath Elena was |K-ne to cool her white hot rage in her fSabin. Yet even then Bhe could not, or Would not see that such comments, and others far worse, though unspoken to her, srrre the inevitable outcome of her behavr our. How could she? A veritable mono maniac, that she was, dragging her husband ,to despair and ruin, would not seem real to her. She did not really know it, and that is the chief terror of the paranoiac who flourishes among us to-day, spreading misery incalculable. The vessel, as usual, remained ten days in Yokohama before turning round for borne, and Elena, bound by her contract, took himself off to the best hotei in the place on the day of arrival. She sent a thit on board to her husband directly, in forming him of her lodging-place, and tell ing him that she expected him to join her ' that evening and stay there, while the ship *ras in port, whenever he was at leisure. The receipt of this missive, although life bad expected it, reduced him to a very pic ure of despair. He had grown to dr=.ad ler so, to fear what she would do next, that ler' shadow fell across every thought, dar cened every hour. He was growing to iate her with a whole-souled fervor, and to ikte himself because he could see no way �y which hi could deliver himself. ' He sat at is desk with the letter in front t-f &im, and the messenger waiting pati tbtly outside, unable to think clearly, much less to write. To him came briskly the ship's doctor, a bright, cheery young ster who was travelling in his present posi tion for his own amusement and instruction in strange by-ways of hie profession. - He brought a report of the general health of the ship'e company during the voyage, Tmt when he saw the haggard face of the skip per lifted towards him he was appalled. He lad found Jemmy a good fellow, but had never grown intimate with him. Indeed, It was the principal curse of Jemmy's posi tion, now that he could find no one to con fide in, he had to bear his horrible burden Alone. A man daren't talk of thinks like that to his junior officers. 'Glory, captain,' exploded the. doctor, ^fphat vpu been doin'? What's wrong?' 'Nothing you can prescribe for, doctor, but sit down; if I don't tell somebody 1 Shall go ofi my chump, I know I Bhall.' For the next half-hour the 'asing of the �verladen mind went on, the doctor keenly ' receptive, and at the close of it the fetter said briskly:� ''This is where I tame in. I have made a special study of paranoia, and I hav3 had an eye upon your wife since she came on board, though she has never spoken to me nor. I to her. Many things are clear to me toow, though, whiph were mysterious be fore, and I think� nay, I am sure� I can help you if you'll do what I tell you. 'Write her a nice letter saying you'll flo what she wants, don't grouse at all, idon't say a single angry word. You'll be comfy enough with her, you know that, as long as you don't think of the voyage. Then I'll fix up a plan by means of which she shall miss the ship, and fehe'U have to stay here till you come back, or run the risk of your always miss ing her if she takes to chasing you. She's got plenty of money and it will do her good � at least as much good as any thing will, poor thing. The only thing at present known that will really cure tuch a frightful complaint is death.' Jemmy acquiesced gratefully; indeed, be rather clung to the doctor, and fling'ns ell his sorrows to the winds spent a tery pleasant week with his wife, for while he was with her she was an angel, ?ntirely unlike some of the worst cases �f the 6ame mania, where the unfortu nate man, whether alone or in company, |b alternately caressed and abused until there seems only madness or suicide be fore him. So happy was he that he actually began to feel compunction for the trick that was about to be played upon Elena. However, his confidant, the doc tor, speedily reinforced his mind, and on the last night provided him with an opiate which the attendant at the hotel tnanaged to give her in a cup of coffee at fcreakrast-time on the day of sailing. It was a crude scheme, necessitating the gnboraing of crude instruments, but it Worked like a charm. Elena fell asleep while getting ready to come down to the ?nip. and when she woke again the tfeeanee had been gone six hours. We must draw a veil over the scene when she realised what had happened, but can point to Jemmy on the bridge of his ship, free from nil awful incubus for another three months at leut.
