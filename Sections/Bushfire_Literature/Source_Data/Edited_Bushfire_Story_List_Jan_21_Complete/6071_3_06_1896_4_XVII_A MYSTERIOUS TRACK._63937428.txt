 The dining room in which the family and visitors gathered for lunch, was the principal apartment of the station premises. Sitting within, one could scarcely have imagined that the materials of which the house was con- structed were so primitive. It was papered with ordinary wallpaper, the ceiling being covered with a very light marble, the whole being pasted upon canvas. A fair size door opened upon a wide verandah, and windows 

 without glass, but with strong swing shutters, and reed blinds on the inside, gave ample light. The dwelling was constructed of roughly split timber and saplings, made weather-tight on roof and walls, with large sheets of stringy- bark. There was very little sawn timber anywhere about it, and what there was, had been cut by hand ; but Jack Holdfast had at this time been squatting at Western Plains for over seven years, and for three of them had been married. The whole place and its surroundings surprised everyone that saw it, for Marjory was so tasteful in arranging her somewhat primitive household furniture, as her husband was handy with his tools. Com- pared with the Twining's place and other residences within|two or three hundred miles, this Western Plains Station, although the farthest of any from civilization, was a luxurious mansion. Things generally would have been far rougher, but since Marjory's arrival, the gold dust and diamond trade with the blacks had assumed considerable proportions, and unknown to any of his neighbors Holdfast was a wealthy man. Money for such plea- sures or comforts or luxuries as they wanted was really no object. He had brought two shipwrights up with materials, at an extrava- gant cost, to. help build his yacht and boats ; and latterly he had two bullock teams con- tinually upon the road, when travelling was possible, to fetch supplies for the use of the station. He would have bought the freehold of his homestead, but it seemed so unlikely that he should be disturbed ; and then he was far from being sure as to exactly which of the Australian colonies he was resident in, The advent of Dorna, and our three travellers was the first serious intimation he had that he might find himself necessitated to protect himself against possible intruders. The lunch was a light pleasant repast, to be followed by the regular dinner at sundown and the men walked down to the stockyard afterward to look at the horses which had just been run up. As they went Hartley gave Holdfast a fair idea of the business which had brought. them to Western Plains. John Holdfast was a tall thin individual, an expert bushman, and ideal pioneer squatter. Tough, wiry and dexterous, he had pushed out farther and farther west, until at eight-and- thirty years of age he was known as one of the smartest of the adventur- ous band, who, reckless of danger, had made homes for themselves in the very heart of the continent. He could track like a native, was a dead shot, and a fearless rider ; in fact possessed a remarkable combination of that knowledge, skill, and experience, which alone had enabled him to hold his own with the varied aspects of wild nature in that far off spot. 'There's a mob of brumbies I hear camped about eight miles out. I want to clear them off, they become troublesome when they get too near the homestead,' said Holdfast. 'Saddles and bridles were soon forthcoming, and the party rode off from the yards by a track along the lake, and passed out of the paddocks into the bush. After awhile the track entirely disappeared, and they rode along through the lightly timbered country. 'This is a very remarkable thing you have told me,' said Holdfast when they had passed out of the paddocks, 'and I may say at once that I am willing to go with you, and take a share of what may be found at the end of the path of Zoo-Zoo. It will likely enough mean at least a month away, but it's my off sea- son, so that will not matter much. I have often wondered as to what there is at the end of the big desert, and it will be far safer for a fair-sized party to go together. Besides what you have told me seems to partly explain something which has often puzzled meï¿½ and others too. There's a mystery out here which has been the topic of many a conversation on the yacht and by camp fires, and I think that if we make up a sufficiently strong party we may fathom it.' 'What's that ?' inquired Hartley. 'Hist !' said Holdfast. His experienced eye had caught sight of the tracks of the mob of wild horses he was in search of. They now fell into single file behind him as he tracked the brumbies through the bush. Lifting his hand presently he turned his mare and told them to follow quietly, and they might see some sport. Fifty yards nearer the mob, which comprised a stallion and half-a-dozen mares, could be seen quietly feeding. The mare Holdfast was riding was evidently interested, for she pricked up her ears and trembled slightly. They had just reached an unusually large tree which had been partially burnt in a bush fire. Dismounting, Holdfast unfastened the girth and crupper, and took off both saddle and bridle, and let the mare go. She walked leisurely in the mob, and after a few minutes whinnied, and then commenced to bite at the grass. The party were now sheltered behind cover; Holdfast down on one knee, with a repeating rifle ready to raise to his shoulder, I watched the brumbies as they lifted their heads curiously, and looked towards the new arrival. 'Susan,' for that was the name of Hold- fast's mare, had been broken into the busi- ness, and instead of trotting across to them, stood still. 'Woa, lass !' said Holdfast, and at the familiar voice she put her. head down and be- gan to feed. The stallion immediately trotted over to her, and the rifle was raised to Holdfast's shoulder, but the mare was between him and the stallion.
