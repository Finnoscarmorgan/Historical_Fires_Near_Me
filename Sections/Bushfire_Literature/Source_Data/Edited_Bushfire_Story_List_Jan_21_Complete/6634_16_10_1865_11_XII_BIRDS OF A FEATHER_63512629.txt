 Keep rage alive till one be lost for over ! "-ROWK. 

 ' " Cooee ! cooee ! " A shrill cry-the first note prolonged, and the last uttered like the sharp crack of a whip, rang through a lonely gully, and flitted like'an evil bird,, from crag to crag, some six months' after the incidents detailed in the preceeding 

 chapter. 

 It was tittered by the black-fellow whom Ave have previously described as being retained in the household of Denisher, senior. He was still attired in his tattered and impel feet attire, but look- ed even less civilized than on his former introduction to the reader ; for a couple of boomerangs were stuck in his hide-belt, and he leaned on a long barbed spear as he listened for the response to the.prolonged signal. 

 ? At last it came-a faint murmur sailing on the wind, indicating .the'Owner, of the voice to be at some distance. 

 ' Again the native raised the shrill peculiar cry, and then threw himself at ease on the short scant turf, till the figure of a man was seen scrambling over the bouldeis, and shouldering his way through the tangled brushwood that choked the mouth of the ravine. It was the young squatter, Linley Denisher, whose livid countenance and blood-shot eyes, together with the ap- pearance of his left arm in a sling, betokened that he had met 

 with some accident. 

 He halted for a few minutes, breathing heavily, as he gained the ; ridge-where the blackfellow awaited his approach; and seemed by his manner Utile disposed for conversation on. any subject. ' ...... 

 " Ha, ha, Misser Lin ! " said the native, rising lazily from .his' recumbent posture, and grinning till his teeth showed like^the keys of" a pianoforte, �ii You bin pretty late a while, dis y'ere time. - It bin 'toppin here by itself watching: ober ridgeland 

 nebber-" ' 

 " Late or early, what the h-1 does that matter to 'yon?" interrupted the young squatter, fiercely. "Lead the A^ay and hold your fool's clack." v 

 A dull green light shot and sparkled in the blackfellpty^"|S.eyes, and there was a perceptible tighiQjiing of the hand th%.gras.ped the spear; but without reply he darted forwju-dj'-anu'^iided. .tlxiTmgh the obstructions, of the way^Avith alsin�o�%'�riake-lik'e motion, leaving young Denisher to scramble dfterpnm'as best he might., . /hrv .^n-.. 

 ? " Come, corni, Hooney," said thatindivid��l, after,a lengthy silence, in a half-peevish, half-conciliatory manner. '"." Th�i'�'� plenty of time ; it's no use pushing along like this, Ave're fools to quarrel." 

 " Baal me Avant to quarrel," returned the native, in an ill-used tone: baal, me want to quairel, but you been tell it yan (go) 

 along ob debbil." 

 " Well, never mind, Hooney, I -" 

 " You say me bin too much piedla (talk)," continued Hooney. "But 'spose you like to hear 'bout Missee Rate?" 

 " Kate Ashworth ? I do so." ansAvered the young man, quickly. " Why, have you been at Woonoona lately ? " 

 Tho blackfellow grinned, and nodded. 

 " Come let's hear all about it. You mustn't mind Avhat I said a bit ago, Hooney, the pain in my arm has made mesnappish. Why. I've got a red shirt and a pound of tobacco for you down at the old man's, and forgot all about bringing them with me." 

 The mention of the red shirt and 'bacca made the blackfelloAv's eyes glitter, but he still seemed rather doubtful, as lie answered, " you too murry cania (angry) Misser Lin, baal me like you get 'nappish. Well, me yan away down to Woonoona yesterday, all men aAvay ,dribe ' um up cattle, me ask chop wood for ' ti teheiv, ole 'ooman. Missus Aswort come out, me say "me murry hungry, Missus," she take me into 'titchen and gib it plenty damper, plenty tea, plenty bullock (meat) ; me hear serban-grirls pialla 'bout ole Misser Aswort him bin yan away to Tidney byan bve." 

 "Ha! then it will be our turn before long," exclaimed Denisher, savagely. " But go on, llnoney, about Miss Kate." 

 ". Me hear serban-girls pialla 'bout Missee Kate bin in lub Avid it young 'tockrhan, Misser Gray." 

 At the mention of this name, Denisher SAvore such a loud and savage oath, that the native sprang aside, as if anticipating a bloAV ; and dropped his spear. 

 "Love him! does she," said the young squatter, bitterly. " There'll not be much of him left to love when I've finished Avith hin." With this threat and a few occasional oaths and curses, Avhich seemed to actas safetyvalves to his fury, Denisher strode' on, followed by Hooney, who, under existing circum- stances, thought it the wisest plan to hold his peace and reflect on the promised red.shirt and tobacco. 

 As the conversation proceeded, the scenery through which they passed visibly altered *, the path no longer led through fertile vegetation, but ran among bare and blasted crags that shot their naked peaks defiantly into the air, and the only signs of vegetible life were a few stunted .shrubs struggling for a bare living in the clefts of the rocks. 

 The track at length opened into a open level, encircled by ranges that ran their spurs far ov.u* its borders, and hid them- selves among the dusky tussocks of kangaroo grase. 

 The valley looked desolate and lonely in the extrene ; even the eagle-hawk flapping its Avings lazily over head, and the two or three head of \\vi)d-cattle that left their broAvsing and scamper- ed up to the ridges, imparted a look of solitude to the place from the feeling that man's presence AA'as but an intrusion. 

 A bush fire had hurried through the valley some weeks before, and its blasting bieath had left nothing but seared blacken- ed trunks and branches, in mourning for their dead foliage. 

 Few people %vould have thought of seeking a habitation in this dreary site, but Linley Denisher, and his companion evinced no surprise at seeing a light column of smoke ascending in the still air, stealing quietly up and up until it lost itself in the clear blue vault above. It issued from the chimney of an old slab hut, Av�iose appearance even when new must haye been rough indeed, but now, withered, and warped, and stained, and bleared, a look of desponding melancholy semed to have settled on it, as if quite despaired of ever again Avearing a respectable appearance. 

 At the end of the house rested a deep unwholesome-looking 

 lagoon; in which a company of frogs were croaking a gloomy chorus all to themselves, until the concert was abruptly terminated by an ��juana, who, alarmed at the travellers' approach, ran down a log, and in its hurry tumbled into the water. Dragon-flies, and a thousandnameless insects with glittering wings darted over the scummy face of the lagoon, where huge clots of rainbow-glister- ing matter floated sluggishly, and where steamy bubbles ever and anon burst forth, as if the pool was sighing off the impurity festering in its bosom. 

 A disreputable-looking cat, who had been sitting on the roof tree, took flight and rattled over the rotten bark as the young squatter'and his sable companion drew near. 

 "I wonder if Gibby's at home," remarked Denisher. "I shouldn't care to have this stroll for nothing, curse him! he might take lodgings where a fellow could visit him with leg over saddle, and not in a place where you have to leave your horse-two miles from the hut and tramp it." 

 " Push at it door , misser Lin," suggested Hooney. " Hallo ! you in dere," he shouted, as he rattled at the slab portal, while Denisher tried the strength of a rude shutter that guarded the 

 window. 

 The blackfellow^ request was answered by a sharp unearthly voice that cried-" Go to the devil ! Ha, ha, ha ! Dick's alive ! Dick's alive ! Ha, ha ! " Immediately afterwards, some bolts were withdrawn, a bar was let down, and a pistol was through the partially-opened doorway, backed up by the rough unshaven visage of a man, who looked suspiciously forth out of a pair of cat-like eyes. 

 On recognizing his visitors the frown on his face relaxed, and he muttered a surly welcome, and turned in to the interior of the hut, leaving the others to follow his example, or remain outside-just as inclination prompted them. 

 The inside of the (/un yah bore even amore wretched look than did the exterior. A dark and smoky den it was, for the window (if an unglazed hole cut through the slabs may be dignified with the name) was still covered hythe un wieldly shutter, so 

 that the volumes of smoke rolled over each other like children at play, without making an attempt to reach the open air. 

 The place was destitute of even the commonest articles of furniture ; one or two sawed blocks of wood were scattered about, but it was an open question as to whether they were intend- ed for seats or firewood ; while, in one corner a heap of old blankets seemed to have been occupied as a bed, and on a saddle which lay by its side was perched a vagabond magpie, so ragged and dirty, that one might fancy his clean linen had not yet come home from the wash. 

 ? He regarded the new arrivals with a cunning twinkle pf his little black eyes, and gravely imparted the intelligence' that Dick was " alive," adding a sepulchral laugh, as a sort of supplement 

 " So we caught you napping, eh, old boy?" said Denisher to ,the master of the hut. " Why, Dick here seems wider awake 

 tham you are, ain't you, Dick ? " 

 The magpie did not condescend to notice the praise bestowed upon his wakefulness, but maintained an-attentive stare at Denishser; as for Hooney, he quietly took up his position close to the doorway; having a superstitious dread of the talking 

 bird. ; . 

 " Very few catch Gibby Darke asleep, I'll swear ! '?' growled the owner of Che mansion, for it is to the bushranger Gilbert Darke, alias Dark Gibby, that we have introduced the reader. ' " But what may be your pleasure in coming at this time o' day ? for I guess you haven't come merely to see whether I'm alive or dead, eh?" ? -,v,: 

 " Come, come, old fellow, .don'tibq.crabby.. Take a swig at this-you know I'm a judge-and jjfcls,jtry� if; you, can be good humoured for once in yourdife,!j,ust' ^y way pf a change." , 

 As Denisher spoke, he.producpd;;a_.bottl.e'of rum from his pocket, and-handed it to his companion. �"iTlie whole fact of �the..matter is, Gibby, that I've got into a plaguey scrape, and want you'to get me ovtt-.of it." 

 "Ha, ha! " So I thought; or I-shouldn't have had the pleasure of seeing you this morning, sitting here on a log by my fireside! Leave you alone for that, Lin Denisher !" 

 . " Now, now*, what's the use of going on this way ? " whined Denisher, like a whipped schoolboy,-"I came to you because I thought you were best able to help me, and knew you would be willing, if you could." 

 "Thai's as it may be," rejoined his companion. "Perhaps yes-but jest as likely, perhaps no. A man isn't very much inclined toputhimselfoutof the way f�rthesakeofacov�thatonly'. comes visiting when he's in troubl� ! Why, it's three months 

 -full three months since I got a glimpse of you last. Then,, about that iast lot of cattle as we lifted, I might say a word or two about them, if I Avas inclined for quarrelling." 

 " Well, well-what's the use of harping on that string, when I've got an affair in hand that'll make, rich men of both of us in a week. I'm sick of this hand to hand life, and now I've a scheme, which, if played out well, will give us that which each, likes best-for me, revenge-and for you, cash enough to make you a gentleman (as far as money goes) for the remainder of your life." 

 And in the eagerness with which he broached his darling plot, the blood run riot in the yoting man's face, and his eyes were lighted with a Avild excited glare. 

 A?' the smoke suddenly altered its mind and rushed frantically up the chimney (as if it didn't want to be present at the scheme of villany about to be discussed) it gave a better opportunity of discerning the features ol' Gilbert Darke, the owner of the hut. 

 He was a man whose-years might have numbered those of Linley Denisher twice over ; and every year of his villanous life had lt ft its record graven in his swat thy lineaments, ns the oft recurring tide leaves its line of refuse on the yellow sand. The li ard cut character of the mouth, and a gashed upper-lip, dis- closing a long yellow tusk, added to the general repulsiveness of his appearance. \\ - 

 Altogether, the picture was one where each of the characters contributed his quota to make up a tableaux of villany ; Gilbert Darke with his haggard countenance, rough attire, and belt adorned with weapons for use, not ornament-Linley Denisher's eager face, ns he unfolded his plan of future triumph and re- venge-the shining sun-lit features of Hooney, who lind turned from the door to join the debate-and last, though not least, the look of concentrated villany with which the vagabond mag- pie regarded his companions, all served to form a .wild and striking scene. 

 " Make us rich men for life ? ah ! so you've often said before, young 'un," responded Gilbert Darke, after a long fit of medi- tation, as he took a pipe from his pocket and leisurely com- menced to fill it, " your schemes sound well in words, Denisher, but they're only sound, after all. As easv and as splendid as they look, they always let you fall through, and then you come to me to get you out of the scrape. However, let's hear the 

 case." - 

 Delighted to have secured the other's attention so far, the young squatter at once plunged into the object of his visit, 

 "You know, Gibby, that I have long tried to get old Ash worth's daughter for a wife, and tried in vain." 

 "Know it, of course I do," growled Gilbert, taking his pipe from his lips and glancing lazily at the pale smoke curling from the bowl. '"All the district knows it, Psha ! more fool you foi sticking up to the gal, when you know it's no go I ain't much ol a hand at compliments, but I will say that the.gal shows un common sens� in refusing to have anything to do-with you, Lin." 

 " As you say you are not in the humour for compliments to 

 day, but let that pass," said Denisher, grinding his teeth; . "I 

 have" found out the the reason of her dislike to me-she loves somebody else." . � 

 " And to mike it fair and square, of course you'hate him," chimed in the bushranger. 

 " Hate him, Gilbert Darke, all the words I know of are not ? enough tovell how much I hate him. If 1 could chain him to alog and let him thirst to death before her eyes-if I could tear his . heart out and throw it quivering on yonder fire, that wouldn't satisfy me." 

 " A queer way of gaining the gal's affections," interrupted the master of the hut. dryly. 

 ''Affection or no affection, I'll have her yet, I'll swear it," continued the other, excitedly. " On two occasions this fellow,. Gray, has crossed me." 

 " And you boast that nobody ever lived to thwart you twice," ., snarled the bushranger, < , 

 " And haven't I tried to wipe off the debt I owe him," demand- . ed Denisher. " Once in the flooded creek he crawled,to land, 

 just at my feet, with barely a spark of life in him, well,,1.; tumbled him in again and saw him sink ; yet, three days after- 

 wards he was riding over the station as if nothing had happened." . 

 " Which proves him to be one of us. not born to be drowned,"., chuckled Gilbert. "It'll take a power of water to drown us, - Lin, if there's any truth in proverbs." 

 " Another time, he was walking through the bush with Kate7 Ashworth, picking flowers for her ; and from behind a gum-tree , at only a few feet distance I fired point blank at his heart. I ' saw him lying at her feet-that was enough for me-I didn't . 

 wait to see more." 

 " Well," said Gilbert Darke, as the narrator paused. 

 "Well," repeated Denisher. "I kept out of thc way for a. week, and at the end of that time, came across the fellow run- 

 ning in a mob of cattle." " 

 "Ha, ha, ha! Dick's alive, alive!" screamed the magpie, with a horrible chuckle, as if quite overcome by the humour of 

 tho anecdote. .. 

 " Ah ! that served you right, for trustingto popguns," observ- 

 ed Darke, reproachfully. "Barkers are allvery well in their \\ way, but they're not tobe depended on, however close you may ] be. You ought to have remembered what I haye always taught you,-sharp and sure,' that's the motto. Now here's something that never deceived me yet," he odded, drawing a dull greasy looking knife from its sheath-"That has felt its way among a good many ribs in its time, and not one that it has tickled ev�r walked the earth again--unless they walked it in a ghostly shape!" , 

 Denisher shuddered. The haft of thc knife looked, stained - and clammy, and two or three threads of golden hair twined about it. ; 

 " What the devil are you shaking at?-like a woman in a. doctor's shop," demanded Gilbert, sternly. " Oh ! at these tell- tales ! who'd a thought of them sticking there !" ho continued, carelessly picking off the shreds of bright hair, and shaking them into the tire, as they seemed inclined to twist about his fingers. " Well, that was a job done for you, Lin Denisher ; so you needn't look so queer about it. Her hair was bright, too ; and Marty was proud of his daughter-but she grew as mad �s her father, after you'd left her here for a time, and wouldn't take kindly to me, no how-so one night when she was extra out- rageous I had to match the sharpness of her tongue with the point of my knife-and there was an end of her. I got the credit of having bolted with her, but if I had a rope and a grapple I could show you what's left of her now-she's only in the water-hole just outside1! " .'' .? 

 Hooney > who had.been idly' watching a couple of frogs play- ing by the side of,the murdered gui's resting-place., hastily came in from the door, when he heard what was lying in the pond. 5 

 " Dying people make' odd requ.es.ts'!^' mused the.-bushranger, running his thumb along the ?b't�^^^'tl��'.-iv'��poh';'' .''" Do you know what that girl begged ofVn��^as ;a favor, when she was dying at my feet ? " ? - .> 

 " N-n-no ! What? " answered and enquired Denisher, as well as .his chattering teeth would alloAv.;. 

 "Why, that the next heait this knife;."shpuld enter might be yours, Lin Denisher! It hasn't done any woik since--so it's rather suspicious ; isn't it ? " 

 "Stow it, can't you?".chattered thc young squatter-"and change the subject ! " And in good-humoured compliance with this request,.the bushranger did ' stow' both the knife and.the unpleasant story in which it had played such.an active part. 

 , ? . Then they resumed ' the old question of what was ..to be done at Woonboha; and after a deal, bf discussion it was finally decided that on Christmas eve (when. Mr. Ashworth would pro- bably be in Sydney, according to lfoou�y's'inform�tioh), � band of Myall natives were to be led to the attack, nerved by rum, and by their love for the * sugar-bag and plour ' at the station. 

 The house was to be"fired, and-in the confusion'and uproar, Gilbert Darke was to pick .up whatever valuables came to hand, while Denisher wiped off old scores with Arthur Gray, and carried his obdurate lady-love to the hut in which the trio were 

 now seated. 

 "And believe me," swore Denisher,'with a terrible oath " Believe me, if I get within;"arni's length of him, I'll make sure woik of it this time I" :' '-?'. ?.. 

 "You had better," laughed Gilbert Darke, "or else he will be doing the same kind of job for you-and thus make one villain the less in this villanous woijd ! " he added, as the young squatter and Hooney turned from the hut-and struck down the . mountain-gulch. 

 "A half-and-half knave !" growled the bushranger, as he returned to his wretched home-"with, all the makings for a thorough rascal, except the pluck. _ A slimy., sneaking knave fit for such work as that,'' nodding his head at"the festering water-hole. " With cunning enough to work the ruin of some fair-faced girl, and courage enough to laugh at her misery after- wards ! However, he serves my turn,;-and if his'account of Old Ashworth's money isn't very highly1 coloured, I can leave himinthelurch, andcross over.to Sydney with-well-lined pockets. I must keep in with him for a time, to work my purpose, and then-Well, poets prate about the bonds of friendship and the ties of affection, and all that; but the cord which binds me and 

 Denisher together is the hangman's rope ! lia, ha !--the hang- 

 man's rope !" 

 " Ha, ha, ha ! " chimed in the ragged magpie, as he entered 

 the hut.
