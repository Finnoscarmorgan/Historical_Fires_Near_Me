 But the report soon spread ronnd the camp. "Kewcombe's Dorrle's taken her boots an' stockins," announced Wilkinson's Ann, an' It's middle o' summer." The men could hardly believe It. "P'raps she's bin down, the creek nt the mud hole, an saw black on her legs," sug gested Adams. Ann's eloquent answer was "what 'ye 

 glvln' us? I've felt of them," she added. They're black cottln, and the boots have toe- caps an' bices an' all." "Well I'm darned," said. Adams, "the poor little cuss won't like that." "Go slow with that langldge," called Jones," "here they come." Peterson's eyes went out sympathetically to the small advancing figure. Bert had told him how the "six and fropence" had been spent, and how loathly the things were to his sister. "Why, Dorrlc," he said, encouraging heartiness In his tone. Dorrle's flush wns deep and dark. "You let me nlone," she said. "Why, they suit you first rate, little 'tin," snld Jones. "I b'leevc In them myself for gals-wot are you trouhllu' for?" i "They're real handsome," said Adams; "what's she grtimhlin' about? Why they want covering up, Dorrlc � they wns such thin, shabby little legs. If they'd been like Bert's, now " Dorrle began to dig nway with her pick axe, "Don't trouble," sbo said, "I heard you quite plainly. 'Don't set her ngln 'cm,' Peterson said. 'Let's gammon we all like 'cm.' Well, I Just hnte.people gammoning." That made tliem Gilenfj, .none of their wits were sharp enough to devise any reply, so they merely washed with great solemnity. "Lc's piny V'glnla," snld Bert, seeing the men began presently to talk among them selves and of their own affairs. But Dorrle was petulant, and resented being taken no more notice of. "She wns the Idlotlcest girl I ever heard of," she said; "If my fnther offered to take mo out for a little walk, and then began mumbling all those things, and stopped and kissed me anil snld good-bye for no reason at all, I'd jnst clear away as bard as I could, 'specially If we'd just passed a butcher's where a knife wns lying round." "A whittle," Bert snld dreamily. But the wen all laughed as Dorrle hud Intended they should. '"Ear, 'ear," cried Adams. "Where?" said Dorrle, looking Innocent. But he took her up smartly, this time. "Bight 'ere, my darllu'," he said; "come out 'ere will you. It's better washln' sand tlmu dlglgng on the bank; you'll only innko n one-horse gole mine there." Pctersou gave him a poke with his dish. Jones's mute told him to shut up for a � long pause� stupid Idiot. Adnras found the effect Of hlB cnreless speech wns to make Dorrle sit Instnutly down on the ground and whip off one hoot and stocking. Peterson looked quite distressed. Don't do It, little party," he said, "she's trustln' you not to." Dorrle poked out n pert little tongue nt hint. "Hold your tongue, grcnt-grand-futlicr Peter," she snld, "shove ur> that tint stnnn 

 Adntns." Adams rubbed bis microscopic nose In a Perturbed fnshion. He. liad only inenut to tense her by Bhowlng a hooted and stocking ed young lndy might no longer rush Into the creek lit all; he bad no thought of stirring up mutiny. Better not," he said, "better not, old wo man." Dorrle wns down nt the water's edge, her ooteil foot on land, her bare one Bplushiug In the mud-mixed witter.

So. though Jones's mate was tempted sorely from time to time, they all sternly refrained and worked stcadb ly awny, talking but little even to -them- to thcirHl'je fuves'1'0 W"h <�refUl ""entlou Wilkinson's Aim stayed to laugh and In cite foi a short time, but the two babies she was hi charge of grew restless, and she moved off with them. Bert galloped sndly about the banks. He mnde seven separate attempts nt piny� he was a white charger, a knight, young Icillus, Mnrinlon, Peterson droving, Jauilcson, Jill- Ins Cmsnr but the snlt laid gone out of everything. "Oh, I frink you might stop now, Dorrle," he pleaded, when he could Instil no life or joy or action Into even Jamicson. "Oh I urn so mlsralible." But Dorrle worked steadily on, a ludi crous small figure, with her well clothed, nutty leg carefully preserved In state on the stone, lior other, brown, bo-blttcn, scratched, planted firmly In the water, and aching con siderably by reason of Its position. "She never told me not to take it off; I'm not disobedient nt all," she said, just after Bert's appeal. "Keep your hoots and stock ings on," she snld, "but never, don't even take one off, Dorrle." Hp their sleeves the men smiled at her specious lameness". Teterson knew that since she wns making Justification for her self the beginning of lier repentance was not fur off. "Bert," he snld. Poor little Bert stood nt attention in stantly. "We're goln' further down � would you like to come? I might think of a yarn or two." . Would lie like to come? Bert would have followed anyone to the world's end; he would liave bartered away bis soul, If he realised he bad such a thing, with the lure of a yarn before him. Such n glad, eager rush Into the creek he mnde; the startled water flew upwards everywhere. "Hind your nice snlt," said Teterson. "Why, It's your other one, Isn't It? How's that?" Bert was repentantly recolloctlve In a moment, and brushed awny the water murks with anxious Augers. "I wasn't frlnklng,"he said; "mid Smallest told me to he careful. "Will It come off, Peter? I have to wear this one always, now; the old one bursts every time I put It on, and Smallest can't mend It nny more." "I'll tuck you up," said Peterson; "the wntov's deeper along here." And lie stop ped and rolled the little knickerbockers far up the sturdy thighs. "Dorrle!" snld Bert, suddenly, "oh, poor, poor Dorrle � oh, Peter, we've forgotten Dor rle." "Ko, we haven't," said Peterson; "not a bit of it. She's n renl bnd little girl to-day, and we've got to learn her." Ho took a step or two, Bert close at his heels. The other men were already fifty yards up the creek, and Dorrlc, standing nlone on her rock In the midst of the water, looked a very forlorn, small girl Indeed. "Peterson," she called, when It forced It self upon her that the expression of his bnclt was resolute. There was a very.'falut note of suing lu the call. . "Oh, Peterson," cried Bert, "listen, she's culling, and she's sorry now. Do be nice, won't you, Peter?" "No," said Peter, "she's n real bnd little tiling." And his heart was quite aching to run bnclt, lift her off her rock, tnke off the lintoful foot gonr, and let her wade Joy-: ously. "I'm sure she'll never do It agnlu," Bert snld, with optimistic fervor. "Pcl-er-son," ealled the small voice, the pride In it almost gone, "Oh, I say, Peter son." "Well?" called Peterson, not turning, hut stopping n moment In bis wulk. . "You're not going to lenve a fellow like this, arc you?" "Well, are you going to keep those boots on?" .Peterson's tone softened, so forlorn wns the spectacle of his little friend. . . > "Both?" said Dorrle, miserably. "Always? I'm sure even Smallest cnu't expect me to 

 ueep uuiu uu. "Now, are you sure?" suld Peterson; "Straight griflln, Wonmuy, do you think that's what she means?" Dorrlc dabbled her wet toes unhappily... "I'll put tliem on now," she snld, '."hut no mtilcing me soy 'honor bright,' Peterson." Peterson shook his head. He knew the value wltli Dorrle of Instnut operation when the Iron wns liot. .

CHAPTER VI. Twice within four days Evan enme homo at 0 o'clock and there wns no ten; such a thing lmd not occurred before nil the years they had been at Wandinong. The first time when he caiuc In Mary was sittlug hi the little living room, one of Dorrle's new stockings In her hand. Rut all thf. time she hud sat there not once had her darning needle passed across the knee chasm that so urgently needed attention. Evan looked first surprised, then, ns lie glanced again at the table where the chil dren's lesson books and a pile of mending still lay, his expression changed to a some what Injured one. The dny liad been fiercely hot; It wns early February, and, as though the sun at that period was not enough to bear, to gether with the four months old drought, bush fires had begun to rage In all the dis trict around Wnudlnong, and tlie air wns chokingly thick and oppressive. A dull smoke mist hung on the hills to the south and east, to the west and north the fires could be seen, glowing red nt night, pale sheets and tongues of flame In the day. Hardly a man in the camp wns at work; tip and down tlie creek, wherever , a , tree flung any shade, they' lay on .their hacks,' with their hats over their eyes,- and their pipes, mostly put, just lu their- lips. 'Jones's mate owned a thermometer; when he told tliem It registered 120 dog. In the shade they felt Justified In their Idleness. But Evan bad worked In bis dogged way the whole day long; he never allowed him self a holiday. Twice -lie hud almost given In, and . gone to n few feet of grey shade tlmt stretched temptingly adjacent, hut the thought of Mary's life urged lilm on ngnlu, as It olwayB did. . For the last month -herliaa gi von up wash ing; he had. foqnij, j.li&J: bnly"by� ceaseless work nt It from'Mouitny -riiOnitBfr'-to Satur day night;' could he give Maty '.enough to keep the miserable jllttlcjiqme from 'falling apart. Sp once inorq) jRcf tried peggihg out a claim, aiitT-jitgglng hwtty' 'at the mbckiug earth lu the1, hop; of ivresting-souie little piece of its h I d deal treasures ,a wat'.- He had liiaiiaged to.'patajittle box of dust aside, however, some months ago, for a rainy day, and Mary had said she would contrive to make the unwilling ends of this month's expenses meet with It, so that lie might liave a few clear weeks for his new operations. But even he had no very clear Idea how he had slrnglegd through that terrible day ; Only for the Increased heap of soil and stoiics flung out on his claim he could almost liave believed lie had lain In a stupor all the hours since breakfast time. Across the flat, bare lands he dragged lils weary limbs; but for n few tldn lines of smoke rising behind the scattered tents be could have Imagined the whole camp' had been suddenly deserted. There tvas no smoke line on his own bill- top, but that was not remarkable, for Mary, these fierce days, cooked In tlie earliest morning, hud made a careful study of keep ing IhingH ns cold as possible for dinner. . IOvnn thought gratefully of the cool drink she would meet lilin With; Ills burnt, aching eyes'- tried to refresh tlicmselvcs with ri mo; meiitiiry mental vision of tlie little, table wltli Its coarse, white cloth nud fresh fern decorations; Its food lis temptingly cooked and dished ns clrcnnistnnces would allow. Rut when be entered Alary seemed still darnlug, and tlie little room was In uninvit ing confusion. She did not even spring up to meet him, put her dear face up for Ills kiss; welcome him, soothe 'him, try to smooth the dtty's troubles nway with .-loving ..fingers. Ho could -never before remember tlie omis sion. True, there were days mid days when be hardly seemed to notice her welcome, barely returned her kiss, answered shortly, ir ritably and silenced Instantly the children's clmttor. But- Mary woiild nover know the Inteuse nppreclatlou.he had of It. When lie cnmc .In this. night nud she made no movement, he -.stood nud stared at lier. She started at Ills-footsteps like ouenwukened from a dicnin, and hurriedly hegaii to run lior 

 licedlc to and .fro across the rent her hnnd showed through. Hut she spoke no word at all. .'H'fl hotter 'go. and wash ; myself, I sup-, pose',!' lie said nt Inst, licnvlly. .. She started again and looked at hint strangely. "What?" she snld. > ; "I snld I'd go and. wash," lie repeated. : !'0h," was all she snld. He went to tlie poor little bedroom wltli n strange chill at Ills heart. Even when he cmno hack- In Ills nlpnen coat, liud with all traces of the soils of the day removed, she hud not stirred to prepare the meal. "Is there. no ten; Mary?" he snld, .niter another strange silence lapse. "Ten?" Bho repented dully. Then darn ing awny agiiln wltli great rapidity, "I have given, the 'children', theirs; they have gone to piny .for a little tlnio." "You, - would like inc. to . get. my own? It wns'too hot for you, Mury.V" 'q "i'oo'liot," she assented. She leaned right back In her corner, and let her hnnds lie Idle. . , " He went nwny Into tlie small, Icnu-to kit chen, and after n little' time kindled n fire and set the kettle on. Only that he knew Ills system urgently required refreshment he would not linvo at tempted It; but Illness wns un evil ho dare not dream of facing. So lie drank ten, and nte a slice or two of the soda brand dry; there seemed nothing else In the box safe. But the food almost choked lilm; there was an Icy hand nt his heart, fear, absolute fear, made his hand tremble till It could not hold tlie cup. "She lmd given up," he said� "Mary- given up." A blunkncss like death walled him In. Mnry, who lind chirped mid laughed, mid made jokes through all these bitter years, who had plucked up Ills own fulling courage a hundred times, who hud worked from dawn till dark, fought the world with those brave little hands of hers, shed no tear of pnln when It flung her, spun wonderful sun shine Into her children's lives� Mnry, given up; sitting In the living room, looking straight before her, her hands lying Ully clasped on lior knee. Something like terror seized lilm; lie saw tiio world ns a strange liell; lie trembled for his own soul, for the souls of Dorrle and Bert. Stumbling feet carried him to her; he fell 

 on his ktiees beside her; he clasped her waist; his head was on her breast. "For God's sake, Mary," be said, "don't give up." She seemed to wake from torpor� this dear hend on her breast; these straining arms; this voice with agony like death In It; they were her husband's. "Darling." slip said� slie stroked bis tbick hair uncertainly� "Darling;" then bIic lean ed back, and Bcemed to forget bint. "Christ!" he said. He seemed like a man In tlie suffocation of drowning; he hurt lier with his arms, his heart lenped against lior like a mad thing. "Don't give up� a little time, Mary� just n little time longer� help me, my wife� cry to lilm, bcseocli Him, force It from Hiui." Ills hands sprang sud denly Into .the air, his face in its contortion of passionate pain lifted Itself, and till the burnt eyes stnrcil fiercely nt tlie tent fly. "Lord God of tlie TYorld," he said, "Give us gold� Christ of the Eartli; now, now, now." She did her best to calm hlin; she loosened bis arms' fierce grip; she -smoothed his hair; she drew his bead to l ost on the qnlet of her breast. And "Evan," she snld� "DnTllng� nothing matters� why are you like this? Wo have each other� hush, don'.t ask like thnt." They clung together till the last light in the room died out beneath the warping door flap. And neither of them Bpokc one other word. , CHAPTER VII. . The next day there was some ltlnd of a ten rendy. Bat the snlt in the potatoes had been forgotten, there, were no ferns,, and though lettuces' grew green In the garden, Alary liad not attempted the salad she al most always made. ... .. And the next day-still,' just , as ;Bvnn stepped1 out of his .-earth, -.works to lioil Ills midday billy, ho saw Bert running over the ground to lilm. ' 1 : "Smnllest's so funny,", he said, a sob -of terroir and spent breath Invhls voice, "won't yon please come-home?" Ei' a n began to.ruu; the little home was almost a mile. nway. When lie had gone in few steps he turned back and seized. Bert's linnd. "Conic,"' he'snld, "run hard." Bert did' his best, but his father � extreme shortness of his legs, and urged greater speed. "Tell me." he demanded, "everything � quick." . "She's sitting In the kitchen," gasped the boy, "an' slie won't speak, an' when she does she 8<iys such silly things." Ho stopped to draw breath, and Evan lifted him In his arms and ran with him, questioning nil the time. "How long's she been like this?" was his final question. "Since brcnkfnst, I frink," said Bert, and bnrst Into a fit of crying. "She's not washed up yet." Then Evan dropped him to the ground 'again, and ran on alone. And now lie knew the fresli evil that lmd overtaken lilm� llnry was 111, 111� she must have been struggling ngnlnst it for days � It was fever, perhaps � no doctor within miles � wlmt woman In the place to help? Wilkinson's wife, perhaps. If sober. How to cool water for her head? How to keep the blazing sun off the roof? Mary was 111, 111. He almost fell through the kitchen door way. Alary looked at him plteously. "I'm only n very little 111," she said. Dorrle's brown face wns oddly pnle, but her hnnds were working capably ns Mary's own. "I've made the bed, Fnther," she said. "Hadn't you better enrry her In? I've got it fire If you wnnt water. Henderson, who halves with Gnffney, got to be a doctor all hut his last- exam., ten years ago� sliull I fetch'. him?" : She sped off hritless through the sun at his1 liod; it wnB' relief to know of even such questionable .help its' that nt such a time. Then he turned. to Mnry and lifted her into his arms. . VMy Smallest," lie said, great tcndcrneBs.nnd strength In his voice � he had even overcome the trembling of Ills lips. 'lOnly n very little ill," slie murmured, then her head drooped forwnrd helplessly, and she slipped away from conscious speech for weeks. When Dorrle told the sorrowful news quite n shadow fell over Wandinong. Evan lind never been popular among tlie dwellei'B in the place; he' never spoke nn un necessary word, never smoked or drank wltli tliem; went, direct to his own homo the mo ment the light grew too faint for work. Half of theni fancied Ills reserve wns due to the pride, of 'education-, and the memory of softer days. These actively disliked him. :Tlie other half thought him soured, joy less nnd felt sorry for the merry children. 

 But the very sight or Mary's thin little .figure wnB a pleasure to tliem. Hardly h matt In tlie camp hut had some story to tell of her ready help nnd sympathy. She had shown Wilkinson's wife and Jones's mate, nnd Gnffney's daughter how to make a dell- clous stew out of the scraggiest ends of mutton. When Jones lind fever and his mate wns nursing him, she lent cool pillow cases for the burning head, made toast water dully and beef tea for tlie convalescent. Adams attempted to commit suicide once; when slie lienril of It and the failure, nnd saw him sliuinertly pegging out new ground as far ns possible from Ills smiling fellows, slie went with the children for n walk next day and got to know lilm. - Yours ago, she Intel learnt he had been nn engine driver, with a wife nnd n little one. His spare time had always been filled tend- Iiig.tlie small garden strip nt Ills cottage; the flower worship, and the little home innde his linrsli. life green. But' tlie wife had slipped 

 pus fingers seized him Instead; before the painful red of her grave was toned to brown and green, he felt himself cast out of tlie service for it carelessness that lind almost wrecked a train. The little one, after sev- eral years' neglect, was sent with a draft of other street lads on to the Sobraon ; Adams drifted to the gold fields and later to barren Wandinong. He found lilmself the day after lie lind not committed suicide, talking to Alary about dahlias, single and double; about cosnicn nnd Its wced-llko upsprlnging; about the beauty of the hollyhock. He was amazed to find tlmt after seven years names anil colors nnd modes of growtk still held n place In his memory. The next week found hint digging and weeding In Mary's garden every evening; she lind admitted she found it heavy work. When tlie cabbage rows were thinned, nnd the carrots hoed, the pens neatly stnkcd, the Ink weeds sepnrated from the geraniums 

 and chrysanthemums, men nc nut an tuo pleasurable glow of the kindly helper; nnd before the winter had fairly gone from the earth, August's uncertain days saw a gar den springing round Ills own blackened tent. Sometimes It occurred to lilm now with sur prise nnd sliamc that three years' back lie lind lifted his hnnd against himself. And now Alary was 111! When Dorrle sprend the woful news there fell a tenr from his wntcry eye. "Well, well," ho muttered, turning aside to dig ngnln, and Dorrle considered lilm un- 

 sympathetic, because he had not stopped work. Peterson's hnnd shook. "There ought to bo a doctor fetched," he said, "from Yotmg. I've nothing to do." Dorrle's throat swelled. "Smallest mnde mo promise not," she snld, "just before she wns very 111. He costs two pounds ten� don't you remember when Gnffney nearly pegged nut tliey got lilm. And we've only, got one pound nnd fourpence." "And firtoen and freponee, Dorrle, In Smnllest's mntchbox," added Bert; "free nnd freponee in really money, slid 'bout ten shillings dust. Don't you frink, Peterson, he'd come for one pound fifteen and frc pence � for Smallest." Peterson said, wltli much vigor and for- getfulness, he'd "blow the beggar's brains out If lie didn't." � He flung Ills spade down, said he wasn't going to stand Henderson tinkering nt her, nnd started straightway to walk the twenty- five miles to Young, calling himself fierce names nil the way, because four years ago lie had drunk nwny that pile of notes shear-, lug liad made, and bereft lilmsef of tlio power to say, "Lenve the doctor to mo; I'll settle his account." Jones made his noble offer In his usual grunting way. He snld lie would lenve half n gnllou of drinking water behind the kit chen every morning. And this, in drought time, when the creek waters were foul, aud clean stuff fit to drink, a shilling a gallon, or two miles to carry. It. "Needn't let yer pa know on it," he added; "mightn't like It � takes 110 stock of me." His mate was poorer, loss athletic. "I'll lenve a quart," he said; "It'll come In, bath ing 'cr 'cd nnd all." . "When she ain't dolnrrious," snld Adams, "just tell her there's n cove gola' to keep hor'gardlng spick an' right till she's round agin. She'll worrit horrid at a night 'bout them young peas bolu' spiled." (To be Continued.)
