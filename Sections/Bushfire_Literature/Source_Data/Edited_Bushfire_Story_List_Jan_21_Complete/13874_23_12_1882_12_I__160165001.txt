SNAPDRAGON : 

 A CHRISTMAS STORY. 

 [By Lindsay Duncan.] 

 CHAPTER 1. 

 Christmas "at home!" Deep snow, bitter winds, darkened skies and shivering humanity outside: inside, the glow of blazing hearths, genial hospitality, mirthful faces, holly and mistletoe, roast beef and turkey, plumpudding and mincemeat, and all the other proper adjuncts of " the festive season." If there were any who amid the apparently universal jollity, were perforce compelled to recognise the obtrusive fact that Christmas owns its drawbacks in the shape of unpaid bills flocking in as unwel come witnesses of increasing and ill-afforded expenditure, they mostly had the decency to refrain from insulting the grand old festival or chilling its ardent young votaries by permit ting the gloomy and disloyal thought to find visible expression on their countenances. So, at least, it was in Marcus Debenham's cheerful country house. No ordinary specta tor could have guessed that a heavy and rapidly swelling cloud of pecuniary trouble 

 brooded over all the merriment and laughter j which woke the sleei>y echoes in the com fortable old mansion. But Nellie Western both saw and felt it. She divined rather thau knew of its existence, but for her it dimmed the brightness and chilled the warmth of all the surroundings. Wonderingly and half enviously she noted what seemed to her the facile dissimulation with which her 

 weak but kindly-natured uncle disguised his cares, and joined with such seemingly whole hearted enjoyment in the gay frivolity of the moment, \\V as her aunt among the deceived or herself a deceiver? she wondered, as she looked at her. But Mrs. Debenham's plump and placid physiognomy revealed nothing 

 more than the endless smile of proud maternity with which she unwearyingly beamed upon her circle of acquaintances. 

 Puzzled, bewildered, and a little weary, Nellie slipped quietly away from among the riotous throng of cousins juBt when the noisy fun was at its height. Drawing a breath of relief at her escape, she paused a moment in a deep, embrasured window to watch the wintry daylight dying in the snow. 

 Perhaps you are wondering ifNellie was a beauty, seeing that I have elected to tell her little story, and that there is a wide spread belief that no story worth the telling can belong to ordinary features and a homely figure; but even at the risk of disappointing you and irretrievably alienating your sym 

 Sathies, I am fain to confess that my 

 ellie was no more beautiful than hundreds, 

 nay, thousands of other English girls. It is true she had suuny hair, eyes both bright and tender, and a kissable little mouth like t be 

 dewy bud of a crimson rose; and this was, perhaps enough to make the sleuder form in its clinging gown of soft brown stuff, with a cluster of scarlet bolly-kerries at the white throat, as attractive a picture as one need wish to see. It fully satisfied Guy Reade's aspirations after the beautiful anyhow, as he caught a glimpse of it in the deepening twi light. 

 "Dreaming, Nellie!" he queried from behind her. She turned towards him with a start and a flush. 

 "Is it you, Guy! How you startled me. How long have you been here ! I didn't hear you come," she exclaimed all in a breath. 

 " It is I myself in propria persond. I trust the shock to your nerves will not prove irreparable! I have just arrived, and it in not astonishing that you failed to bear me, as Prince's hoofs made no sound on the snow, and I rode at onee into the stable-yard, and found my way in without announcement," responded the new-comer with uiuch gravity, replying to her questions and assertions in proper order, ana quietly hold ing a pair of small soft hands the while>� 

 probably with the view of warming his own, which were chilled through, and through with his long cold ride.' "Nowit is my tura> Are you glad to see me, Nellie!" 

 "Of course I am glad," she answered shyly, though with evident sincerity. "But, 

 0 Guy, how cold you are ! Do come into the 

 drawing-room and get warm." 

 "Thank you, I prefer remaining where I am. The County Lunatic Asylum, might, be holding its Christmas revels in there;, to judge by the row they are making. Besides, 1 came to see you ; and here you are. Nellie, you know what I came to say to.you, don't you, dear?" 

 If this question were of an embarrassing nature, Nellie was happily relieved from all necessity for replying to it, for at this moment the drawing-room door burst violently open, and a crowd of youngsters of various ages tumbled pell-mell into the 

 wide hall 

 "Nellie ! Nellie 1" shouted half a dozen voices at once. "Where are you? It's shabby to run away and leave us like this. Come and play 'snapdragon.' We're just going to begin. Hullo, Guy : come along. You11 play too, won't you ? There s a good old fellow ! Bet you wont get as many plums as I do. Are you on ? Now, then, look sharp. Fathers got the matches. Come on, NelL" . 

 Resistance or expostulation would have been worse than useless, so the pair submitted to being whirled away iu the torrent of the 

 children's excitement 

 " I haven't played ' snapdragon' since trs played it last together years ago, Nellie^" Guy contrived to whisper, as they stood round the huge flaming dish. "Do you remember how you burnt yourfingers?" 

 Keltic nodded. 

 " And how you tried to console me by giving me all your own plums," she added. 

 They smiled at each other over the childish recollection, and it seemed to both as though that look and smile, exchanged in the midst of the children'seagercrowdingandshouting.and revealed only by the blue, fitf ul light of the flaming spirit, contained an intensity and depth of expression which gave them to each other and set them apart, as it were, from all 

 about them. 

 Certainly " snapdragon" is a prosaic and commonplace old institution enough, and not very capable, you would think, of being sentimentalized over�but Guy was youthful, enthusiastic, and very much in love, and he had contrived to say many pretty things (or what passed for such in Nellie's indulgent and uncritical ears) upon this apparently barren subject before the evening was over. 

 " I will snatch the sweets of Fortnne out of the fires of Adversity and Trial for you, my darling," he said, rather grandiloquently, " and these tender hands ahail never need to brare tbe flames"�and so on. It is eruel to quote a lover's rhapsodies in cold blood� they sre fragile blossoms which ill bear transplantation from the tropic heat of pas 

 sionate utterance to the frigid latitudes of ' pen and iuk. 

 Suffice it to say that, in spits of her anxieties, Nellie Western laid a happy head upon her pillow that Christmas night, secure t in the ripened love of her childhood's sweet 

 heart, and confident in the future, with the Btrong sweet tfustfulness of youth. 

 Alas for her love and trust! 

 The storm gathered to the full, and broke over her adopted home, carrying away in the violence of its rage all that had made that home happy, even to the life of its kind 

 hearted owner. 

 And just when love would have been most precious and consoling came calumny and evil tongues, and said I know not what to drive those two asunder. And so they parted. 

 And Nellie, working on bravely for her helpless aunt and cousins, was often doubly cheerful, because her heart ached so cruelly within her bosom that she sometimes fancied it was broken. If you doubt this you know nothing of women. 

 n. 

 Christmas in " the colonyHigh summer, sapphire skies, and blazing sunshine, dust, ana mosauitoes, glorious starry nights, and long hot days. All this affects Nellie Western with a strange and almost painful sense of incongruity�it so completely sub verts all the cherished Christmas traditions 

 of her childhood and early youth. And yet it is not the first Christmas she has spent here�it is four years since we saw her last, and two *of these she has already passed in 

 South Australia. 

 When her Aunt Debenham's placid smile began tobeam upona second husband, and the many cousins were fairly provided for, Nellie bethought her that she had some distant rela tives living inAdelaide, to whose often prof feredkindness she resolved to entrust herself until she should meet with employment to render her entirely independent. In this she was actuated by a strong, but unacknow ledged desire to leave her native land behind her, and with it, she vaguely hoped, some of the silent sorrow that weighed so heavily upon her sensitive but brave young heart. 

 " We should like to keep vou with us alto 

 gether, my dear," said her good Adelaide relatives (cousins a dozen times removed). �' Why should yon go away to work when there is a comfortable home for you here?" 

 " Yon are more than kind, but it is quite impossible," replied independent Nellie, with tearful gratitude. *'I could not be happy unless lhad my work." 

 So she took it where it offered, becoming governess in the family of a well-to-do sheep farmer, and buried herself in the obscurity of an up-country station. 

 " W Hat is ' snapdragon,' Miss Western ?" 

 The auestion broke suddenly upon Nellie's half-saa musings. Perhaps there is no season ot the year which so inevitably awakens re trospect and regrets in thoBe who have any past to grieve over as thiB same joyous time of Christmas! Nellie had been unwillingly thoughtful all day, and the child's casual query chimed oddly with her thoughts. 

 " It is an old-faisUioned game the children play at Christmas-time ad home,"she replied, rousing herself. " Have you never seen it ?" 

 " Never," answered the child. " But there is something about it in this book, and it seems to be great fun. How do you play at 

 it?" 

 " There is- not much skill required," said Nellie, smiling. " Some raisins are placed on a large dishy and spirit is poured over them. It is then set on fire, and the game consists in- seeming as many plums as you possibly can without burning your fingers." 

 " And do the plums taste good ?" demanded a solemn youth oi eight, whose gastronomies! instincts were already largely developed. 

 Nellie's qualified assent sufficed, and the children went off in a body to-beg the need ful materials fovthis new diversion. 

 " Are you remaining long in the colony, Mr. Beade?" 

 " Well, that depends upon, circumstances. I have nothing to take me back to the old country; andao-I'mfond.ot farming I have serious thoughts of frying, to hay n run somewhere about here, if I can meet, with 

 one." 

 " Hope you'lLmake up your mind to settle. We'd be glad to have you for a neighbour. Must you go on to-night ?:' 

 " I think so,, thanks. It wdll bat pleasant riding in the cool, of the evening.. There is bright moonlight, and yon say the track is easy enough to find. Mr. Merrick must have been expecting me. for some days already." 

 " Well, if you must, yon muse,, though it seemB inhospitable, somehow,to leba. stranger leave one's soof on Christmas Day-"' 

 " Christmas Day ! I can. hardly realize it, in spite of Mrs. Davieslagood pluntpudding," laughed Guy Beade, as he leapt into the saddle. "A thousand- thanks- far all your kindness, and good-night." 

 Throi^gh a mistaken di-sctibn Guy had found himself on. the previana night many miles away from, his destination, and had been only too glad- to. avail himself of the heartily proffered hospitality of the honest farmer upon whose land he. had unwittingly wandered. 

 It was. as he had anticipated, a delightful ride. .As the sub saak iu a flaming glory, the colours of which the most daring of artiste, would tremble to attempt conveying to> his canvas, and those indefatigable workers, the bush flies, retired from active business for the night, a calmer and healthier mood stole over nis somewhat 

 restless spirit than any that was usual te it. 

 Bronzed and bearded, and with little of the careless gaiety of four years ago about him, tiuy Reade was a good deal changed from when we saw him last To-uight he vaguely felt this change himself, and brooded with a fondness for which lie generally scornfully upbraided himself upon the. memory of the past. 

 Of Nellie he knew nothing�absolutely nothing�since he had parted from her in bitter auger and distrust, and dreamed of nought less than that she was then within but e few miles from him. 

 Suddenly a lurid light gleamed on the 

 horizon ahead. 

 . "A bush fire 1" he thought. "What an odd effect those yellow flames have in the white moor light 1 

 Half unconsciously he hurried on towards the scene of the fire, and drawing nearer he 

 fancied he could discern the outline of some building amid the flames. This further ex 

 citing ' nis ? interest, he rode on rapidly, and finally sprang from his horse in the midst of a group of frightened women and children, breathlessly watching the greedy element de vouring their home. 

 " Mr. Reade, I suppose," said a stout gen tleman, advancing with ontstretched hand. " I'm glad to see you, but sorry we're com pelled to give you such a very warm recep 

 tion." 

 " Warm, indeed," responded Gny, rather surprised at this cool display of colonial phi losophy. '' Can nothing be done ?" 

 " Nothing in the world, my dear Sir. _ We have rescued all we can, as you see" (pointing to a wilderness composed of various articles of domestic furniture, piled together in the most admired disorder) "and we can now only stand and watch. The bouse is chiefly built of wood, and it is as dry as tinder. There's no water to put it out, so it must 

 just burn. Luckily it is insured. Oouie and let ine introduce you to Mrs. Merrick. My dear, this is Mr. Reade, whose arrival we have been expecting. Miss Western�where 

 is Miss Western?" 

 Guv started at the familiar name, It was an odd coincidence, he thought, that he should come unexpectedly across some one owning Nellie's patronymic juBt when hiB thoughts had been so full of her. 

 "She was here a few minutes ago," replied Mrs. Merrick, "but I don't see her now. 

 " Surely she has not ventured back into the houBe!" exclaimed Mr. Merrick in some 

 alarm. " That little girl has been among the bravest and most useful of us to-night; but it would be foolhardy to go inside now when the roof iB giving way," 

 " Miss Western' went in there," volunteered a tiny damsel of five. " She went to fetch my white kitten. It was shut np iu the cup 

 board in the schoolroom." 

 Mrs. Merrick screamed aloud. " Are you certain. Bessie ?" 

 "Yes, quite, "sobbed the little maid. "She went in there �" and again a small forefinger 

 Sointed to the blackened aperture of the 

 oorway. 

 Guy waited for no more. In another instant he was within the burning honse. 

 The smoke was suffocatira, the heat in tense, the glare blinding, while the crash of falling timbers almost deafened him. He fought his way on resolutely in spite of all, for a woman was in danger, and she must be 

 saved. 

 It seemed to him that he had already traversed two apartments opening one from another, and was on the threshold of a third when his foot struck against something soft. Stooping hurriedly, he found it to be the prostrate form of a woman. Was she dead T At least she gave no sign of life, and he quickly raised the senseless figure in his strong arms and commenced bis retreat. It was hard work now, burdened as he was; but at last, staggering and half-stnpefied, he reached the door just as the whole roof fell in behind him with a terrific crash, and the flames leaped exultingly over its rums. 

 When Nellie opeqed her eyes she fonnd herself under the bright starry skies, with Bessie's white kitten clasped to her bosom 

 safe and unhurt. 

 But who was that bending over her ? Waft she dreaming ? She had half fancied she saw that same face, but looking younger and gayer, smiling at her through the blue Sanies of the fatal " snapdragon (which, in upset ting, had caused all the mischief) an hour or two before; but that, she knew, was only imagination, and surely this could be no 

 more! 

 " Don't you know me; Nellie!" 

 Ah, there was no mistaking the voice t Wonderful and incomprehensible as it was, it was her old lover who had: rescued her I This, then, was the gentleman whot bringing a letter of introduction, from Mr. Merrick's brother, had been invited to spend some weekB upon the sheepfaxm. "ta see how he liked it," and who. bad been expected for some days past. Nellie had never heard his name mentioned, and was wholly unprepared for Guy's; sudden. and startling; appearance upon theacene. 

 All available modes of conveyance, being laid under contribution,, the' house less party made their way as rapidly as possible to the nearest neighbour's,, who chanced to be' the hospitable Mr. Davies, who had already entertained Guy earlier in the day. 

 Afterwards there were esplhnations, which both secretly felt to.be almost unnecessary,, 

 between those two. 

 What had parted them all those sorrowful years ago ? A foolish misunderstanding such as separates scones of. loving hearts, bred audi fostered by the envy and malice of others, and nourished m the unhealthy darkness of secrecy by pride and.angeiu But all that was. over now, and once again, their troth was. plighted. 

 " I shall never think lightly of the. time honoured game of-1 snapdragon,"*' observed. Guy smilingly to his bride some time later, "since I feund my greatest treasure- amnng; 

 its flames."
