 CHAPTER XVͻ � 

 -Tlie news �f Westonley's sudden death Avas � great shock to Gerrard. The .brief telegram from his half-sister had berm forwarded to P�rt Denison, and I<aoey had sent it on to him at Fraser's Gully by the mailman togethei* with a copy of the "Clarion, containing the telegraphed account of the Dkcre s bank failure. Had Gerrard looked at the 

 newspaper, he might perhaps have con- nected Westonley'i sudden end with the financial disaster, "which had brought ruin to so many thousands of Australian 

 homos, for he knew that his btother-in- ' 

 law banked at Dacie's. But Mrs. Wes tonley had said nothing of the cause of 

 ;her husband's death-"Edward died sud- 

 denly yesterday. Am writing you fully 

 to-night to Port Denison" was all that j 

 she had said. I � "Dear old Ted !'' he said aS his eyes tilled, and he saw before him the great bearded face with the kindly, mirthful eyes, and heard tho deep, �ruff voice. '4\\How eau I tell Jim-the boy will be heartbroken." 3- -i j ?, And Jim's grief almost unmanned ';�ncle Tom," as the boy now called him, {Putting the telegram in his pocket, he 

 tw6nt- down to the battery, where his | protege was being inducted into the 

 mysteries of amalgamation by Fraser. 1 \\ ? "Jim," he said quietly, "pome along tlie creek with me for a bit of a stroll. 

 |� "Ia your face paining you much this morning, Uncle TomP" said the boy, as they left the battery, and walked to- wards the creek, "you look quite white." 

 " "No, sonny," and he placed his hand affectionately on the boy's shoulder, ."my face isn't paining me, but I have a thundering big pain in my heart. Jim a pain which yob must share with me. I have just had a telegram from Marum- bah-with very, very �ad news." 

 t t'ls it about MaryP" and the boy's lips quivered; "is she sick, Uncle P" and then, with a gasp-"is she dead?" 

 ? "No, sonny, Mary is all right, but Mr. Westonley is dead," and then he told him all that he could tell. 

 � An hour later, when they returned to tho house, and Kate Fraser wondered why they looked so quiet and depressed, Gerrard told her of the news he had re- 

 ceived. j< , 

 j "Poor Jim !" she said, as she put her �rms round the boy, who was trying hard not to again break down. 

 I Then Gerrard went on to say that he "would now hare to, change his plans 

 somewhat. 

 < "I must get back to Port Denison to- morrow. MiflB Frase/. I want to send �onie telegrams as well as letters. But as it wil| take my sister's letter quite a fortnight to come from Marumbah, I shall put in most the time at Kaburie, 'and, if I may, �lso inflict myself upon �'our father and yourself occasionally." f "Do. We shall be so glad." 

 ^ Two day's later he and Jim were hack in Port Uenison, �nd lunchihgjrith La- cey at the Queen's Hotel. Then for the first time Gerrard heard of the Dacie bank failure. 

 ti "It must have teen a fearful shock to jnoor Ted," he said to Lacey ; "and per- sians it was that that killed him, for, as ?fou say, the hank suspended on Satur- day, and he died early on the Monday following. I fear he must have been hit very badly by the 6inash, for he not 'only h�d a lot of money in it , but was a big shareholder m tho concern as well." i| ."That's unfortunate, for yesterday's �iews gives further revelations of the swash, which is the very worst that has pecurrod in the Colonies. Every one thought that Dacie's bank was as solid as th� rock of Gibraltar." 

 : This intelligence disturbed Gerrard greatly-so muoh eo that after lunch he *'iseut a telegram to Westonley's Mel 

 �our ne agents-who were also' his own 

 nd asked them if they could tell him !iow his sister would be affected by the Collapse of Daere's. In a few hours he �occived an answer-"Deeply regret to say everything will be swept away." 

 i' 'Poor Lizzie 1" he said tb Lacey after 'dinner, as they sat on the verandah, f-mioking ; "this will be terrible news for lier-if slie does not already (know pf it. �Thank God, I can help her to some ex- tent, " and he meant to "help" her by giving her Kaburie, for which he had �uly a few days previously sent Mrs. 

 allis a draft upon his bankers for six jtliousand pounds. 

 *i ''You were lucky not to have had any- thing in Daere's." 

 j-/ "y�ry, for Westonloy was always tracking it up. to nie. He urged me strongly only six months ago to ouy n (hundred, shares-� pretty hole I should Sie in now if I had taken the poor fel 

 ow's advice." 

 �St ''Yes, l"c(eea. But n& bile ever jdreaint pf DaereY being �nything but �uet of the soundest banks in the world. St is. ft blackguardly affair-a cruel, shameless fraud-and I hope- that tho ineri who are responsible for it wUl each feet seven years' hard labour." 

 "They d�serve lt. I suppose that Wyestonley with Marumbah Downs, and rO�met Vale, and the funds he had in �P�cro was worth � nundred thousand afc least, and now, my poor sister and 

 little Mary Rayner will he absolutely ?penniless. Thank heaven. I did not t�ake his advice, but stuck to the Capri 

 �cornia� Pastoralists." 

 . The editor of the "Clarion" gasped and 'droppen-his clear. But ho quickly rei covered, himself, pn3 -turning- .his faca away from Gerrard,??traffod but volumes 

 pf smoke most energetically, considering what he should do. He soon decidecT "Better tell him the grim truth at once," he thought. 

 'Gerrard !" 

 The change in his voice struck his companion-it was low, grave, and sym- pathetic 4 

 "What ia lt, Lacey? Now, out with it. You have something unpleasant to tell me, and don't like doing it. I'll bet you drinks that I can guess what it is. I saw you start when 1 mentioned the Capricorn ian Pastoralists' Bank. Has that 'busted' too P" 

 "Yes. It smashed yesterday as a re �ult of the Daer� collapse. Tho news was in my rag this morning." 

 "Waa it? I didn't look at the "Clarion" to-day 1 Is it a bad case ?" 

 "Very bad; about a shilling in tho pound is all that will come out of the wreck ! Will you be hard hit ?" 

 "Ratherl Curls me up like a cork- screw, To pay Mrs. Tallis her six thousand pounds I gave � mortgage on Ocho Rios for five thousand pounds as I Only had about three ol' four thousand pounds in the Capricornian. I'm deuc- ed lucky it wasn't more." 

 He rose from his seat and paced an- grily to and fr� on tho veranda for a moment or two, then ho stopped sud- denly, and a smile lit up his scarred face. 

 ''What an ass I <am, Lacey! The thing oan't be helped, but only a little while ago I had made up my mind to five Kaburie to my sister, and now I 

 an't pay for Kaburie, for my draft for six thousand pounds is worthless to Mrs. Tallis, and all the labouring and mus- tering and branding has gone for no- thing. Poor little woman! I am sor- ry for her! fen t it a beastly mess?" 

 "You think too much of others, Ger- rard, and too little of yourself." 

 "I don't! I'm very fond of being good to myself, 1 can assure you. But a smack in the face like this is enough to make a saint swear like an Austra- lian Member "of Parliament. Now, I bought Kaburie with an idea of making it a breeding station-prize cattle, and all that, sort of thing-for Ocho Rios. Then when I received this telegram from my agents in Melbourne telling me that my sister would be left penni- less, I made up my mind to write to her by the next mail south, and tell her that Kaburie was for her and my niece Mary. And another thing I wanted to do was to give a man 1 know a good lift." He meant Frazer. '�And now 

 I'll be as good as stony-broke for the 

 next two years." 

 "I wish I could help you," began Lacey, earnestly. 

 "Thanks, old man. It la awfully good of you, but 1 shall pull through all right in the end, and with a good season or two should easily lift the -mortgage on Ocho Rios. All I am scared, of now is the drought, but if a drought does come, 1 can't stop it, and therefore, it Js no use my worrying about it." He hoisted his feet upon th^ table, and touched tho bell for tho waitress. "Well, thank heavens, Lacey, 

 I still have a thirst, and an iced brandy and soda is very soothing to the nerves. Milly, bring the ice. again, please, and if you see my boy tell lum to come here." 

 Jim soon appeared, still looking sub- dued and depressed, 

 "Sit down old eon, and have a long drink of ginger �le with a lump of ice in it," and he put his li and on the boy's arm, and made him sit down between himself and Lacey. "Jim\\ - my .�on, 5Ve just had some beastly bad news. V� lost a lot of money, and you and I will hare to work like niggers when w� get to Ocho Rios. 8awy?" 

 "Yes, Uncle Tom. I will work vei-y, very hard for you." 

 "For us both. Jim, and for Mary and Aunt Lizzie ; for we are all in the same boat. I'll tell you the whole yarn by and-byo ; but for the present we'll talk about something else for a change." 

 Lacey looked at him in silent admira- tion and wonder. "Nothiug can dis- turb the equanimity of such a serene mind," he thought, "and I like him for taking the youngster into his confidence like that." 

 "I wonder what made Aulain leave so suddenly," said Gerrard, as Milly appeared with the ice, and the ginger ale for Jim. "It was strange of him not to even leave a note for me." 

 "Oh! when a man has fever he does very queer things. All ho told me was that he was off to Brisbane to tender his resignation in person, and as that is against the regulations, he hoped to be dismissed. He has been very strange lately. I think matters have gone wrong in a certain quarter."' 

 Gerrard nodded. "I lenoir. Well, I'm sorry if it is the case. She is a bonny little lady." 

 Miily again appeared. "If you please, Mr. Gerrard, Sergeant Macpherson would like to see you for a few minutes bu important business," � ' "All right. Milly! Ask him to come up. Jim, I hope yon haven't, been up to any games while I was away." 

 ' The Sergeant of Police was shown up. .; "Good evening, 6�\\" he said. "I have just had a wire from Cardwell from In- spector Sheridan saying that, news had come through by the mail boat' from Somerset, that there, has been a very bad bush fire np your .way,, arid the sta- tion destroTod." * * ? < '? * 

 "Any lives lostP" 

 "No, sir, but thc fire spread all over the run for fifty miles about, and your stockman thinks that there are hardly two hundred h�ad of .cattle left. I am sorry to bring you such bads news, 6ir." 

 "Oh, don't apologise. Sergeant," was the quiet reply, "I'm getting used to bad news. Milly, bring a chair for Mr. Macpherson, and another big glass, and some moro ice. Now sit down, Sergeant, and tell mo all your news. Jim, get off the railing, or you'll fall off into the street, and break your leg. My luck is dead against me. Light your pipe, Sergeant." 

 CHAPTER XVII. 

 "The saying that misfortunes never come singly seems to be verified in your case, Mr. Gerrard," said Kate Frazer, aa, a fortnight after he had received the news of Westonley's death, he was relating his disastrous experiences to her and her father. 

 "Looks like it, doesn't it? But there are lots of fellows who have had worse luck than me, and so I shouldn't 'make a song' over mine. Now, do you know 

 the story of Knowles's life?" * 

 <lNo, he has never told us." 

 "Well, he told it to me yesterday" (Gerrard had been to Kaburie to toll the dapper little overseer that he could not pay for the station, and that he, Knowles, must retake possession as manager for Mrs. Tallis) "and I think the poor little chap only related it out of pure sympathy for me when I ex- 

 plained to him how I was fixed, and 

 how sorry I was for him-as well as for myself-for I had doubled the salary he was receiving from Mrs. Tallis." 

 "He told me that," "said Kate, and her eyes sparkled with fun. 

 "Naturally, he would tell you," and Gerrard gave Douglas Frazer a sly glance, with a faint quiver of one eye fid. "I am 6ure you must bo the recipi- ent of the confidences of all the coun- tryside, and would never 'give'anyone 

 away,' as vulgar persons like myself would say; so please don't 'give me away' to Knowles." Then his voice changed. "Miss Frazer, that little man is both a hero and* a martyr. He was in the Naval Brigade at Sebastopol, and was recommended the V.C. for dis- tinguished bravery in one of the futile attacks on the Redan. Did you know 

 thatP" 

 "Nol He only told us that he was with Peel's Naval Brigade and had seen 

 j most of the fighting, was severely 

 j wounded, and that after he came home he left the Navy through ill-health, and came to Australia." 

 "Well, he didn't get the Cross after 

 all ; that was his first bit of bad luck.. Then his father, who was always looked upon as a very wealthy man, went smash for a huge amount, which ruined hundreds of people, and then shot him- self; so poor Knowles left the Navy 

 and took a billet as houso-master at a | boy's college. Six months after, his i uncle, Lord Accrington, died, and left Knowles twenty thousand pounds. Of that twenty thousand pounds he kept only five hundred pounds; every penny of the rest he gave to his dead father's 

 creditors." 

 "How noble of him," said Kate, 

 "It was, indeed, 'but you see, he said to me, 'I didn't want the money. My mother had, died years before, and I hare no brothers or sisters, and it would have been a disgraceful thing for me to have kept the money after what had occurred. Lord Accrington was my mother's brother, and I was al- ways a favourite of his (he did not like my father, and had not spoken to him for years). I never expected he would leave me a cent, and so it was no sacri- fice on my part.' And then he said that ten years ago he had saved enough money to buy a small sheep station m the tiverina District, and then came the drought of '72. which broke him." 

 "Poor fellow !" said Kate, "I shall like him now more than ever." 

 Gerrard nodded. "One doesn't often come across such men, And, as I was saying, I have no reason to make a soug over my affairs when so many other fel- lows have had worse luck than me." 

 Douglas Fraser, who for the past few days had been depressed in spirits, said 

 �s lie rose from his seat : 

 "True, Gerrard, it is of no use any one girding at his misfortunes, if they are not caused by himself. Sometimes a man thinks in mining parlance that he has 'struck it rich,' and straightway be- gins building his Chateaux en Espagne. Then he finds he has bottomed on a rank 

 duffer, and wants to swear, as j do now. He smiled and spread out bis chest. "Kate, I'm going up to the claim to see Sam Young. 

 "And Mr. Gerrard and I are going to the creek to catch some fish for supper/' 

 "Very well ! I shall come back that I way and join you." and the big man 

 strode off to the claim-half a mile 

 i away. 

 I '"Your father is not in his usual Tspirit*, 

 I think, Miss Fraser," said Gerrard, as he and Kate walked down to the fishing pool through the ever-sighing she-oaks which lined tho banks of the creek. 

 I "He is not; the reef has been gradu \\ ally pinching it, and Sam Young told 

 him yesterday that he is afraid it will pinch out altogether. Last Saturday's cleaning up at the battery only yielded ten ounces of meltd gold-about forty pounds-and the week s expenses came to one hundred and forty pounds. I sra afraid. Mr. Gerrard, that father and I and all the men will have to leave Fraser's Gully and set our faces to the North, and leave the old battery behind us to the native bears and opossums and iguanos and snakes," and her voice falt- ered, for she deeply loved the place where she had spent so many happy 

 yea i's. 

 "I am sorry," said Gerrard musingly. "I suppose j'our father-if you do leave here-from what he Said to me is think- ing of going to the newly-opened gold fields on the Gilbert River F" 

 "Yes, in that direction at any rate, prospecting as we travel. That is the lone thing that consoles me: I love the: 1 idea of seeing new' country." 

 Gerrard ruado uo answer for some minutes. He was thing of a certain place on a creek, running into tho Ba- tavia River. The place "with a bunk- ing big boulder standing up in the mid- dle of a deep pool," of which he had spoken to Aulam, and he now half-re- gretted his promise to him to "keep lt dark," for six months. 

 "Of what are you thinking, Mr. Ger- rard?" * 

 "I was wondering if your father would care to make a prospecting trip up my way instead of going to the Gilbert rush. When I left Ocho Rios there were several prospecting parties on Cape York Peninsular-some of them doing very well-and I myself got seven ounces of gold in a few boura from a creek about �ixty miles from my sta- tion. Unfortunately however, another man as well as myself knows of this place, and he asked me not tp say any- thing about it for six months. Ho means to go there with a prospecting party." 

 "You mean Mr. Aulain," and Kate turned her frank eves to his. 

 "How did you know?" 

 She flushed. "You remember the 

 letter you brought me from him. In 

 that letter he told me that he was leav- ing the native police, and intended go- ing in for mining, as he knew of some very rich auriferous country near your 

 station, and that you, who also knew of it, had promised him to keep it secret from any other prospecting party." 

 "Yes, I did. I should like to see Aulain 'strike it rich,' �s your father says, Miss Fraser," and then he smil- ed. "If (>nly for the sake of my kind, patient nurse of last month." 

 Again Kate's face flushed. "I know what you mean, Mr. Gerrard, but-" she bent her head, and began to tie on a fishhook to the line she was carrying. "But you are mistaken. I like Mr. Aulain very, very much, but I do not like any one enough to-to-oh, dear! I've broken the snooding." 

 "Never mind I'll fix it for you," and as his hand touched tier a new hope came into his life. He knew what she meant him to understand-that she was not going to marry Aulain-and then he went on quickly. 

 "I gabble like an old woman. do'I not, Miss Fraser? Oh, this is what I was about to say. I believe that t�ie Ba- tavia River district is full of rich reefs and alluvial gold as well, and from what I hear from Lacey, I don't think the Gilbert will prove a permanent gold- field. Now, I will try to persuade your father to come to my part of the country instead of the Gilbert, which, by the time he reaches it, will probably be play- ed out altogether, and abandoned." 

 "Ah ! do persuade him, Mr. Gerrard ; I liked the thought of our going to the Gilbert, but I like better-oh, ever so much better-your suggestion of the Batavia River, for there we should be near the sea, and I love the'sea and the beaches. I am horribly selfish, I am afraid." 

 Gerrard stroked his beard meditative, ly. "Yes. you'll be near the sea, Miss Fraser. But it is an awful country for a lady to live in ; the fever is very bad there, and the blacks are a continual source of danger and trouble." 

 "Anything that my father can go through I can face too" she said proud- ly ; "and besides that I have had fever, 

 am not afraid of blacks or anything 

 except alligators," and ehe shuddered, 

 as she smiled. 

 "Thou you will be in a continual state of fear. AU the rivers on the Peninsu- lar arc alive with them, and I have lost hundreds of calves hy tho brutes." Then he laughed. "But they won't get many this year." 

 "How bravely he takes lils misfor- tune " she thought. Then she said, "Well, I shall take good care of myself, and not cross any creeks if the water is not clear. Now, hero we are at tho Cool. Isn't it lovely and quiet ? I do 

 ope we shall have enough fish by the ... 

 time father comes." ""~ ? 

 Gerrard, as he filled his pipe, watch- 

 ed her smooth, slender brown handB baiting the hook of her lino with a small grasshopper, and noted the beautiful contour of her features and the intent expression in her longlashed eyes as abo surveyed it. She looked up. 

 "Now, Mr. Gerrard, what are you do- ing? Don't be so lazy. I'll have at least three fish before you have your line ready. Oh, I do wish I were a 

 man 1" 

 "Why P" 

 "Because then I could smoke a pipe when I am fishing. It must be delight- ful ! When father and Sam Young and Cockney Smith come herc with me to fish, and I see them all looking so plac- idly content with their pipes in their mouths, I feel as if I was missing some� 

 thing. Now, watch!" *~ 

 She made a cast with her light rod of bambo, and almost at thc same moment that tue impelled grasshopper fell upon the glassy surface of the pool it was seized by a fish of the grayland species, known to Queenslander^ as "speckled trout." 

 "There you are!" she cried trium- phantly, as she swung the silvery-scalod beauty out of the water and deftly grasped it with her left hand. "First 

 to mo." 

 The music of her laugh, and her bright animated features filled Gerrard with delight as ho witched her make a second ca6t. Then he too set to work, and then for the next quarter of an hour they vied to make the greatest catch. Gerrard was a long way behind when Douglas Fraser appeared. ^ Ho was saying over and* over again to himself, there is nothing between her and Aulainl there is nothing between them!" Then, as he put his hand .to his scarred face, tue wild elation in his heart died away. ,,�,., 

 "Well, young people, what luck?* said the burly mine-owner, as with bia bands on his hips he leant against a she-oak. . " _ 

 "Splendid, father 1 thirty-five. How is the reef going?" . 

 "Pinched out all together, cluck. We can hang the battery up now." 

 Kate laid down her rod and cover- ed her face with her hands, and Ger- rard saw the tears trickling through her fingers. For she loved ene Gully as she had loved no other place before. 

 Fraser stepped over to her and placed 

 his hand on her bent head. 

 "Never mind, little girl! We'll strike it rich some day." 1 

 "Yes, father!" she .whispered, as sh� smiled through her �tears, "we shall strike a patch some day."
