 BOY'S STORY. 

 CHAPTER XXV.�Seizure of the Mary Jane. 

 By "BULLOO." 

 During the following two days the boat was kept well out of the tracks of passing ships, and met with none ex-<*> cept a brig on a northerly course, and 

 'It was carefully avoided. But the next day a schooner was seen heading for the South, which Siminonds recognised as a member of a large Brisbane-owned pearling fleet, and the boat was put on a course to intercept it. Their plan af ter a great deal of consideration was to begin shooting as soon as they reached the deck, taking care to kill the cap tain. Tom suggested It would be better to keep snug on board until they had Bounded some of the crew, but Sim inonds knew the schooner and her men, �nd said there would be no trouble witin some, while prompt action would com pel the timid ones to join them. .When the scheoner perceived the boat Standing across her ahe altered her course to meet them, In a few minutes iiaviug them alongside, when she was laid to and a rope thrown and secured to the bows of the boat. The captain was not favourably im pressed with the appearance of Its occu pants, but as piracy was unknown in those waters he concluded that at the (worst the newcomers were escapees from New Caledonia, and hailed them In a friendly manner. The men climbed on board together, when: a revolver shot fired by Longun killed the captain, 

 while the mate and a decent-looking young seaman were shot by Nugget and from, Simmonds covering three sailors jrith his rifle. One of the latter, crying " Good for you, bullies," Held his hands up, and iwas motioned by Longun to join them. She other mate and the remainder of Die crew, aroused by the shooting, rush ed on deck, when they were instantly covered by the bushrangers' weapons. /Two of the crew dived down below, but the others stood still, and Longun, who bad easily assumed command, proceed. Ed to question the sailor who had joined them. " Are they all on deck ?' demanded1 XiOngun. 44 Yes," replied the other, " except the two who cleared out" "Are any of them good enough to join us ?" was the next question. "All except the second mate and those blokes who scuttled down below, unless you hoist the Jolly Roger." , " Have they get any firearms ?" 1 " No, they are kept In the old man* jcabin." " Is there no chance of the mate and. the other two chipping In. with u�?" t " Not a bloomln' bit." 44 Well, all the worse for them," said fLongun. i He then addressed the crew saying: - "Well, bully boys, you see we're in. possession of your old hooker and mean to keep her. We're going to have a Ixdly time with the proceeds of the cargo and ship, so all who are gain? tn Join us had better step-ados* the-daefc." The men, all except the mate, wbe> stood glaring attnebuattrangmknored across in a body. " Now then, Mr. Mate, do yea want to follow your skipper to- , or will you Stand In with ub ?' The mate with difficulty controllinc Ills temper replied 'i "I'd sooner die fifty tffcatns than be associated with a gang of murderess" He then gave hi* rage full sway and denounced them in. unmeasured* tones .until Tom shot him down. Brown, the man who had first joined them, was sent down to-ascertain what could be done with the other two men. He soon reappeared bringing them with, him. They were decent-looking- young fellows, who, although, pate* were self possessed, and stood looking their leader square in the face. -" You see what has happened to those fools T" said Longun, pointing to the dead bodies. "Will you join us or share their fate ?" 44 What are you going to do ?" d�* manded Williams, the elder of the two. " We're going to make a South Ameri can port, and having sold ship and car- O� divide tlhe plunder and disband. We ftave 20,000 sovereigns in, the boat also." " We are willing to work tne ship," was tne reply, " but we won't take part in any outrages." 44 What do you say, boys 7* demanded the leader. " Shall we take them on those terms ?" Fortunately for themselves the young fefiews were genenltr pepular and the ?ms* no doubt sickened at the previous issod�hed, unanimously assented. 44 Chuck the canton ererteard, and* Mat the stuff &V* ?*** Lonjpni. Tfee contents of the tee-boat baying fetes transferred fie the Msry Jane, her bottom was stove in and she was cast adrift. iWhen the schooner had been laid on 

 her course all bands assembled aft, and Longuu was unanimously chosen as leader, but Ills experience of the sea was of a limited character and Slm nionds was appointed sailing master. It must not be supposed that the crew of the Mary June were on a par with the bushrangers, In fact the majority of them were not much rougher than the usual run of island trading crews ; but as Longun and Slmmouds had foreseen, any scruples they may hare possessed were removed, or smothered temporar ily by the suddenness with which the boat was seized and her officers killed. Consequently beyond discussing the sit uation in low tones they went about their work as usual. They had taken no part in the outrage* and were work ing under compulsion, so did not tear the law. Williams and Martin were two young Englishmen who had heard such flatter ing accounts of the pearl industry that they determined to- visit the fishing ground themselves, and in order to gain � thorough insight Into the work shipped at a low wage on one of the fleet Having mastered the details of the busines� they engaged on the Mary Jane. They were son and nephew re spectively of a small ship owner who had left them between five and six thousand pounds, wnlch they Intended to Invest in boats for the pearling trade. Williams was the elder of the two and. a better altoouad man than hie cousin, 

 whey though active enough, was not possessed of a superabundant quantity of brains; but the latter had Implicit faith in the other and followed his lead blindly. It was a. terrible blow to the young men to be compelled to- live with the. murderers, but there was no alter native, aa they comported themselves as civilly as they could, resolving to es cape at the first favourable opportunity. While tne Mary Jane is dancing over the waves with a six knot breeze on her quarter, we will describe the men w"ho had joined SUmnonds and helped him ta commit further atrocities* Longnn was a striking looking man of aftmut forty, standing six feet two in his bare feet, straight as a gun barrel and with feariess looking eyes. He was evidently active and possessed of con. slderable strength. Nugget, whose name was as accurately descriptive as that of his leader, was a short block of a man with broad, deep chest and mus cular limbs, an ugly antagonist at close quarters. He was not a bad look ing fellow, though not as handsome as Longjin* and was apparently of the same age. Tom, the third bushranger; was of an ordinary type, average height; average build, and commonplace in every particular except the shiftiness of his eyes. He could not look anyone straight in the face, but took in per sonal details, as Longun said, " with glimpses." For all that nothing es caped his glance, and he saw more of what was going on about him than any three men. The crew of the Mary Jane oB for no comment, as they were mere tr tools in the hands of the superior rascals, and obeyed orders. The schooner was a swift little craft, and the way hi which she got through tne water was highly satisfactory to her new owners, who hoped to be clear of the barrier reef In a fortnight, when 

 they would be less likely to encounter any vessels that might interfere with them. " Do you tbink the chnps would stnnd by us If we tackle another ship and collar the cargo V" demanded Longun of Sltuiuonds as tihey sat on the sky light. " They might," was the reply, " but it would have to be some craft that couldn't defend itself. I don't think they'll fight much, besides it would be a hanging matter." '� Suppose you sound 'em," said Lon gun. �� We might drop in for sometihlng soft, and it woudd be a pity to miss it. We niuy as wett be hung for a sheep as a lamb." Simmonds nodded assent, and stroll ing forward entered into conversation with the men. He displayed a consider able amount of diplomacy and succeed ed in eliciting the men's opinions with out arousing any suspicions in their minds as to his object. With the ex ception of Duncan, who ihad first joined them, and another man,�he (fid not approach William* and Thompson�the crew declared strongly against doing what would place a halter round their necks. "More fools they," was Longun'ff comment when Simmonds had reported. "We could easily loot a ship or two and get clear off." Simmonds was- not at all keen upon the project, for lie realised that hi the 

 event of their seizing a ship, a man-of war from Sydney or Brisbane would be put ob their tracks unless they killed every- one on board and scuttled the ship, and he felt sure the crevr would, not agree to anything so. drastic Con sequently he was not displeased at the result of his enquiries and said soy Str ing liis reasons. But Longun waa a reckless man, possessed of extraordinary courage and a perfect belief in himself. He had only to entertain a proposition to regard it as an accomplished fact, so he re ceived Siinmond's report with; Ul-eon cealed disgust. The next day he bad made up his mind to try his own hand at openly persuading the crew to be come pirates, and colling them together he said: "Look here, chaps> I've got a pro posal to make which you'll accept if you've got any sense. We're got a clinking little craft, and we're well armed, so 1 don't see why we shouldn't hoist the Jolly Roger and take anything we meet with. I can't beat about the bush, it's not my style. All my life I've taken what I wanted, and believe me It's the best game. We run no risk, no one will know our port, and as it ia unusual for craft like ours to go to America, we will* get away easily. A. few thousand pounds more to divide won't hurt us. Let me know to-morrow what you think about it" The leader then went below. The men realised at once that Sim monds had- been sounding them, and were as a rule relieved at having pro nounced against piracy previously; but oae or twa of the more lawless ones discussed the proposition fully. ** I Am't see why we shouldn't chip in," said one. "That Longun is a born leader, and I'm on to follow him any where." �-....- 

 "You might follow him to tfhokey," said ouo with a 'grin. "He got there oace, nnd he might again." As this was the general view, the crew felt no qualms at meeting the leader again next tiny, and as Sim monds had prepared him for their ans wer, lie said shortly : " Well, what are you going to do ?" " We're not on," replied, the man wba had been appointed spokesman, and he was about to give their reasons when Longun waved them away snyiug : " All right, go to your owu way," and walked to the stern. Fortune was still favourable, for one bright morning as soon as the sun. rose one of the men called out: " There's a ship on a reef on the port bow." Leas than a mHe away was a barque, Her forefoot almost clear of the water as she lay nearly upright. The sails were all furled, audi she looked as snug as if in dock. Tuere was no smoke issuing from her galley nor any other sign of life. " She's abandoned*" said Longun, " so we may as well have a look at her/ The anchor was dropped within easy reach of the ship, when Longun, Sim monds, and half-a-dozen others pulled off to her and were shortly on board. A gaping rent in the vessel* bottom told the story of her being abandoned, and as the water washed in and out of her hold Lougun said : " She'll never float again*" ** It's dead low water now.'* said 81m. mouils." and she must have ran upbore at high water. If s a wonder dh&dtdii't lose her sticks, but perhaps there wasn't much wind behind her." The cargo was apparently intact, the hatches being- on, so the leader said': "The sooner we overhaul her stuff the better. They'll be- buck for her car ge a* soon a� they can. It's a wonder no o�e ha� been left to charge of her." " Perhaps the caretakers have cleared out," suggested Simmond*. "They weukl never tmrrin Ut I(lrituff like tikis far the fijrst^�qfagfe^^Wle." "? Anyhow, yftrJJjMMtT one henj which is perhaps aJpjw'xbingr^* t)ira," said Longun- jlmjralmiillM^r.iiiiii. T\\m\\ wire in straigfli/ggiray." y ; '?' & The hatfigfl w^p rented jrod a cur sory exaiwnmtan jjjpired ||ke contents of the hol�^o^�^eliep/merchandise of more in Pi n iiiin There were a thousand cases of whisky amongst other consignments, and the crew's eyes glistened as they anticipated the pro longed spree they would indulge in shortly. As much of the cargo as could be found room for was stowed in the Mary Jane, and two days after the wreck had been sighted the schooner set sail foi Ber destination. When the last load of plunder had been removed Longun set fire to the Maraqulta- in several places, saying: 

 " They'll think the blacks have done It, and won't suspect she's been tooted." Longun and Simmonds were well aware the men would Insist upon hav ing a drinking bout, so when they came in sight of a group of islets the former said : " You chapg are badly in wont of a boose* ain't yer ?" Air eager chorus in the affirmative was the response, and he continued : " Four of you man the starboard Boat; and if we can find a channel we'll take the old hooker in amongst those Islands where she is not likely to be seen, and have a day or two's spell." There was no lack of volunteers, and four oars were flashing in the sun shine as Simmonds steered the boat be tween tiie nearest islets. Plenty of water was found for a much lurger craft than the Mary Jane, although the channel was rather too tortuous for ab solute safety; but it was negotiable with ordinary care, and the party re turned in good spirits to the ship, which In less than an hour was an chored hi tiie centre of a group of atolls whose lofty pine trees hid her masts from -view. Blankets, firearms, cooking utensils, safl� for making tents, and, though last by no mean* least, twenty cases of whisky were taken ashore. The camp was chosen at the foot of a timber-clad rise on the bank of a small lagoon, from which a large flock of ducks arose on the appearance of the intruders. Tfre cook from sheer force of habit pro ceeded to light a fire and arrange his pots and pans, but he prepared no food that day, for in less than an (hour he was lying with his feet in a boiler and his head resting against a kettle, insen sible with liquor. Longun drank freely and Simmonds slightly, while Williams and Thompson took a glass or two hi order not to pro voke bad feeling. Longun did not drink to excess, for, as was the case with Simmonds, he looked forward to dnjoying liis life in a foreign land, and 

 would not do anything to lessen bis chance of doing so. Some of the men were quarrelsome in their cups, while others oceanic hil nrious ; but they all ended in falling in to ft drunken sleep, and the sober men had to cook their own food. On the second day of the carouse three of the men were seized with de lirium tremens, one of them flinging himself into the sea, and as the sober men were on another inland shooting there was no one to interfere, so he was drowned. This led to two of tihe " tea-drinkers," as they were derisively called, being left in charge of the camp, Longun and Slmmonds taking the first turn, and Williams with the mate the second. When the former were on guard one of the crew, who had been lying sullenly under a tree, crawled up behind Slm monds and was about to brain him with a tomahawk, when Longun looked up, and perceiving- instantaneous action was imperative raised his revolver and fired, aiming at the man's arm ; but the maniac moved and the ball eutercd his throat. As Longun was directly opposite Sim monds. who-was naif asleep, the latter thought he had 'been fired at and seized , his gun to retaliate, but Longun said : " Look behind you and see what you^^ hnvfr escaped. He would have split your akull in another second." " That was a close call," replied Sim. monds. " I may do the same for you some day. If s that sulky brute Wat son. I thought he was too stupid to do anything." 

 "We'll have to break up this spree," wild Longuu. " It'll take them two or three days to get square again. I never saw fellows go into it so deadly before. I suppose If s because it costs them nothing:" When two- or three of the more rea sonable men, or those who were so ill they loathed the sight and smell of liquor, had recovered a little, the " ten drinkers" persuaded them to stand by them in an effort to restore the others to sobriety. A little cajoling converse ly with a few judicious threats of vio lence had the desired effect, and the drunkards were put on nn ullowance. The remaining cases of liquor were re moved to the ship, when one or two at tempted to rush on board, but they were promptly knocked down and se cured until they submitted to law and order. They were allowed a certain number of drinks per day, and after a A few days* treatment were sufficiently recovered from the effects of their de bauch to resume duty. One calm morning the schooner was towed out into the open sea, and drop ping anchor awaited the expected breeze. About eight o'clock, as was its custom, the north-east trade wind camo up, curling the sea into little white cres ted, waves, and with a sigh of relief Simmonds seized the helm and hurled a parting curse at the group of islets. " You'll <have no more sprees If I can help it," he muttered. 

 "Here we are right end up again," said Longun heartily. "We've plenty of tucker and water, and with a good ship tinder us what more can we want ? In a few weeks we'll be shaking -a free leg on shore, gentlemen at large with no one to say ug yea or nay unless wo bump up against the police." " I shan't trouble the police," replied Slmmonds. " I'm going to settle down quietly on a bit of a farm just outside the town." " Well, it's no use saying what I'm going to do," said Longun with a laugh, q " I've never looked ahead, and it's not worth while now, but 1 mean to have a good time all the same. I wonder what steamer that is on ahead of us. We're rising her smoke fast, so she must be coming this way." " Coastal boat, I expect," replied Sim moods. "They're piling on the coal twy, and she's making enough smoke for a bush fire." Shortly after he remarked : M That's not a trader, that's a gun boat" " She won't bother us anyhow," said Longum "If she were coming up be hind as It might be different She's not likely to want to speak to us."
