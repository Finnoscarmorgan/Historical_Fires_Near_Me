'l&rk or Fair.' 

 CHAPTER V. i. tEBEtBLE OEDEAfc. 

 It was very hot. Not a breath stirred the stunted foliage of the few trees -which straggled for existence in Benjamin Rennick's garden, The air was sultry. The scene appeared like a , .molten ball of glowing metal in a brazen sky. All nature languished. Flowers bowed their 

 fragile heads, and drooped for lack of moisture. The grasB withered in the scorching attnoSphere _ till the cattle looked in vain for verdure, and lay down beside the dry bed of the creek to die. Polly looked from the open door, and longed for the grassy slopes and verdant hills of New Zealand, yearning with a soul Hunger winch, too words could express for the beauty and vigor of that old 2ife4u which she h%d been so kappy. She thought of the old bridge among the ferns, and of the day oa. which Paul had sketched the lovely scene ; of the strawberries, is their luscious . freshness, and the wild clematis twining in luxuriant beauty round the tall fern-palms. And just then Eeuben Kennick came along the sandy track, stockwhip ia hand, whistling a tune ; and, as he looked up and saw Polly standing there, he quickened his steps, for n� had sotnG- - thing to �ay to his fair cousin which could not brook delay. He was not used to being thwarted in his wishes, this young man, who looked upon the broad acres of his father's large station, and knew they would soon be bis own, and much more 'besides them, for Benjamin had prospered in Hew South Wales, so that his only son would be a rich squatter, 'Many a good little girl would bo proud of an offer of marriage from Beuben,' said fcis father. 'But, as the boy wanted Polly, why, ; let him have her. J2Vould keep the money in I the family.' Never a thought of Polly's possible , refusal entered his mind. Who would dreiitti of refusing wealthy Uncle Benjamin's only son.?.. Polly^ father, enfeebled in health and iiLfcel ect, yielded passively to his brother's wishes, and expressed his desire that his child should Become the wife of Reuben Eennick. The young girl, ; intent on the duties of houseeeeping, the care of her little brother and sister, and the cultivation . of her pet flowers, so difficult to preserve in any- ' thing like their natural beauty during the -severe drought which had set in, thought not of Betiben, much less of love such as his. And only wlien '-.. his attentions became� too marked to escape notice, and she noted the,. expression of pilule' Benjamin's face as he saw:iiew bis soa's atjfcen- , tions were received, did- Polly realise her true ' positions ' '?''??.'? , ^. It meant just this : Uncle Benjamin willed, and her father feebly supported the union cif these two lives so opposite to each other. Tha� happi nees was not to be thought of. If Ma will were crossed, a thing1 he regarded as almost im possible, there would be a serious quarrel, in volving the separation of the brothers, and the impoven&liing of the weakest. So Benben Ben nick came to woo ; and none must Bay him nay. A tall, powerful figure, a countenance expressive ; of strong passion, and ah intensely selfish nature, eyes of cold gray which seldom met another's ?with the full, clear glance of sincerity, but Beemad to look at one comerwise, and baffle one's inten tion of reading the soul's language in their ever changing gaze. Polly knew why Eeuben came along the hotwe track with such a confident tread, cracking his whip at Fate. She would fain have escaped. But that was not possible ; for Uncle Benjamin would have resented it as an insult; and her father would have suffered. So she calmly waited for this unwelcome lover's wooing, though her very soul revolted at his presence. ' G-ood morning, my girl,' said J&eubrn, trying to look pleasing; ' Is it hot enough, for you to day?' ' Thank you, cousin Eeuben, it is-fartoo warm for comfort, or health either: c I hope we shall soon get rain.' ... 'Bain, my lass! Why, thafsnot to bethought of. Tour fortune will be-made long before we get that.' ???'?? :...?;::??? '' '!' ' - . ?

' 'Very well, lad,'** said Benjamin Renniekj ' if she'U not have tb.ee, Til not hav* her sot her stupid old father, brother though he is of mine, on tills 'ere station. So I'll just- let them know, and then I wonder where her pride will be. What does the minx want, I wouder4 a-setting of iiereelf up with aire ?'J . So the storm thickened around her head* and Polly had to bear daily a series jof ipettypersecu^ tions, hard words, and . sareaaiao remarks, cruel misrepresentations, and parental upbraidings j for Benjamin made it known that unless Pdlly favored Ms s6n*s suit before another month had BpBa, the father and daughter should no longet find a hoffle beneath his roof. The drought continued j the heatinerfeaSed, and it was hinted that several bush fires had burst out not many raile* a.way- Soon the atmosphere be came laden with the dull glare of distant smoke and flame; and the cattle died by thousands that itiinaer for want of water. In spite of all Polly*s eai*, the childifen began to languish; and before many days dear little EUeii had gone to be a ' hea^efi angel,' with her dear inothar ; and Polly stood beside the grave of he? darling, tearless and agonised with a speechless, sorrow 1 no one but E0U0 to sympathise with her or mourn * child. That night, when all the house was still,. Polly and E0U0 went out, and sto6d by the ndwrmade grave. ' I am going away to-night, Boll�*** said Polly, in alow, conitraiaeii voice ; 'little Ellen is with mother, safe frem all harm. Will you corns with fcieP' ' Where are yott going, Polly ?' asked the lad, looking up, half frightened into his sister's face. *rI will take Priftee, the pany I bought of Jacko, for Ellen; and you can take the creamy. We will go to the nearest settieinent, and then get on to Sydney. I can be6,r fchi� no longer.'* When the cool wind sprang up, and the moon beams shed their; Jdndl;? radiance 6vef tile quiet homesfead, Polly and her young brother prepared to depart; Thay had spoken to their father very gently that evening.;, but his failing intellect seemed too weak to grasp the position. ' Surely, tJAuia Beil will bt� good to him,'* saiia JPoXLyi 'I eanaot marry fieubsn j and when I am gone, they will cease to worry father about it, and they will ti6t hafe to fceep Boilo/1 Ho the two went out together; aad soon, mounted on their faithful Bfceeds, they were far away across the plain, hurrying toward the coast. The first gray stroake of dawn illumined the fcAstertt sif vrhdn tke travellers stayed td rest their notees b^ a little spring, a.Ad t&ke some re freshment which IPoHf had provided. They boiled their billy and made some tea, which refreshed their wearied energies* so that they felt able to continue their journey. Again mounting their horses, they were s&on s0m6 Miles distant from their camping place, ?wlxen they became conscious of the vicinity of bush fireB by the dense heat of the atmosphere tllroiigli which tiiey were passing. ' Oh.Eollo, the bast between ub and the settle ment must be on ure,' said his sister in dismay. 'We shall hair� to tflrn baek/' *. By this time enrliag wreaths of lurid smoke could be discerned, but ib seemed behind them. Surely they had riot heedlessly left any sparks at their resting place 1 However this might be, one thing was certain� the fire was behind them, in felentleas pttrsuit; and their horsee, tired with loag travel, c&uld not outstrip the fiery element. j.*he air grew thick, the heat in tense 1 the horses panted for breath, and pre sently became Overpowered. Polly-was not quite certain of the track, and Bollo had only once b&fore tiJaversed this journey with the faithful Jaeko, who had broken in the horse for the chil dwn's ? use.- Weary and dismayed, the young travellers ones Jiiore dismounted, and scanned the dreary expanse beyond in the hope of discovering some horseman who might help them to a' gafe retreat. v 'See, s�4hfti?e.!?-*?cried'Spllo presently.

Eollo tried to mount t'te pony ; but either from weariness or excitement, he failed in the attempt; and the last Polly saw of the poor boy was trying to hold on to the bridle, lest the animal,, too, should for sake him. On, on, went Seuben, through scorch ing heat and flying sparks ; the hot ground causing the horse, to plunge more madly than ever, and its glossy sides reeking with foam. They came te tke home station just in time to witness the firing of their homestead by the blacks, who had been incensed by Beuben's con duet toward : a member, of their tribe, and watched f or th-ir revenge.

In a .stately mansion, .'where every luxury abounded, and beautiful Art spread out. her trea sures on every hand; where Wealth outspread its bounties with a lavish hand, and men hung upon the lips of th� possessor of such vast re* Bources, Lord Loveless lay a-dying. Phypi'laaS had exhausted their skill, and priests their prayers. The wealthy owner of vfisG estates, noble building's, and regal fortunes, must die, and leave them all !.. Silence, fell upon the stately home. Men spoke in whisp�fs ; and footfalls trere hu&ed upon the I threshold where the death anjjel lingered, wait I ing but the signal of the Infinite to obey His : bidding. ; J, And Lord Loveless was Afraid of the transition j5 through Wuich lie had to pass. He thought of tfiase significant wopls, ''* As a man soweth, so even shali he reap ;' and he trembled before the invisible, and prayed, that he might live to redeem the errors bf the pafet ; for his eyes were opened, and he saw the worthlessness of wealth without love* of life without some labor of which the angels -jould bear record. He lay upon his pillow, weak and almost speechless; the physi cians by his side, and the pastor of the church he had himself built and endowed waiting to Admin ister the last - words : ��' consolation to his passing soul. But Lord Loveless wanted neither physic nor prayers. His spirit yearned for that which has earth-life had never won-^-th� love and sympathy of one kind human heart. His will was made ; Mb immense wealth bequeathed to various benevolent iiUstitutions and scientific societies. But lib loving hand soothed bis last hours ; no tender regrets would be *breathed over his remains. -His tumbling hand was raised to beckon Ms vaiet, who stood near $ aad they heard him whisper, **Iu the secret drawer, in the fifth, panel of the library, som? old papers j fetch them ; quick \\' But ever as the man went swiftly to do hie bidding, Lord Loveless was dead. Th� etately home was very silent. Sombre draperies and costly funeral arrangements, every thing tha-u could add di�aity to the occasion of a rich man's death, were there; all but loving : hearts to mourn his loss ; and there was none I to ffiottrn or sjl�d a grateful tear to hie memory. ! He had lived in luxurious selfishaeea. He was laid in a splendid vault ; and there were no dowers to_ deck his resting-place. The will was read ; and the secret paper was not found, though search, was made for it. in �rery possible place. The vast wealth of Lord Loveless was plaeed in the: hands of the trustees of the institutions to whi�n lie had bequeathed it ; and the world forgot thk possibility- of the existence of that unknown record. And the. only daughter of the old earl knew hot of her birthright, knew not that her fatlier died^ with .the thought of her mother's wrong's restang upffn his spirit like the brooding wings of some dark vampire, and that he strove in vain to breathe her name. . ' 'Paul Fizzele waited in. his studio for the arrival of Nellie and hfer father. Again and again ke looked at his watch. The hour appointed for tite fitting was long past; and he had never knoHm?,them late. Always punctual, and with eve^ ^creasing delight at the suceess of the picifer^^Nellie had presentad herself at the studio at tiie^iven time; and those hours were among the bright hours of her life; times when she -could roan verse with beauty, and feast her soul -with 'tis� love of the sublime ideas of the poet artists whose magic touch had unfolded to her wondering view treasures new and old. But this morning Paul waited for his beautiful model with growing impatience ; for the hours were precious now, as the picture, so near completion, was the constant theme of the artist's fchokghts. - . ? ' 'Well, I'll go out,' said Paul, looking at his watch; 'here, Tim (to -the little lad who served as page), if any one comes while I'm out, just say I:ve gone round.to the club.' v '/The children of the people, in town and country, are ever subject to changing circuin 'stanoes.

Some hours must have elapsed since deatb took placa, the doctor said ; and heart ? disease must fiav�s been the sudden eanse of his departure.

The object of this Company is to provide the highest class Hotel accommodation for -the travelline public from all parts of the world to Australia ; to arrange for the banding on of travellers by circular letter to 'Hie leading Hotels in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane; to meet the demand for increased and increasing local Hotel require ments; and to purchase that magnificent property ' mflE AUSTRALIA,' which is eight (8) storeys high, ejected on ? Iarg3, central, and quiet site, built of the very best materials, on the latest and most improved European and American plans, thoroughly famished throughout, and fully equipped for economical working; and which is supplied with inde ?-. pendant electric lightinz, elevators (passenger and i�a?gage), refrigerating chambers, &c., &c .

Lassetter and Co., of Sydney and London* The Glass and China Ware to Messrs. Dynon and Sons, of Sydney aud London. ' The Australia ' is without a rival in the Southern Hemisphere, and has been designed to provide accommodation of the very highest' character. The arrangements are of the most perfect description, and everything has been done that skill can suggest to give Sydney an Hotel unequalled in the Southern Hemisphere. . ' The city ot Sydney contains a population of 400,000 inhabitants, and is becoming more and more important as the, terminus of the several lines of magnificent oceangoing steamers, which are weekly bringing to our shores vast' numbers of tourists and others who can appreciate and are. willing to pay for the comforts of a Superior Family Hotel. ' The numerous natural attractions in and about Sydney, together with its *? Home' likeness will more than ever tend to make Sydney the headquarters of visitors to the colonies. It is therefore confidently expected that the accommodation of '?' The Australia,' large as it is, will be taxed to the utmost, and within a very short period, the question of enlargement will have to be seriously considered. The position is elevated and quiet� one minute's walk from the General Post Office fthecentre of the -aty\\ � close to the Tramways and the proposed Great Central Bail way Station, theprincipal places ofan-useaient,TJie Law Courts, Parliament . House, Museum; Domain, Hyde Park' and the beautiful Botanic Gardens. An idea of the general character of the Hotel :. may be obtained from the following short description, from which it will be. seen that there are splendid features intro duced which are quite new to the Australian Colonies. Attention is particularly directed to the . node Entrance Hall, 24f t wide, leading into the magnificent Central Court, 72ft long and 35ft wide. The grand Dining Hall, 100ft long, 45ft wide, and 25ft high, is the finest dining-room in the Australian Colonies; while the Smoking and Beading Booms will equal in capaci|y and comfort those found in the most famous hotels in Europe and America, ' f The wants of families have also been provided for in the numerous handsome suites of rooms, which, are fitted up . .. 'With every accessory that can produce comfort and. privacy. ' ? The Vendors sell the Freehold Site on which �? The Australia' stands, together with Furniture, Elevators, &c, on ? file following terms, viz. : The Vendors will arranare a Mortgage overthe property, bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per �''��, for �150,000, and will accept payment of the tminw-o as follows ? . . . 50,000 paid-up Shares ... .� _, ... ... ... v ... jg50,000 ?
