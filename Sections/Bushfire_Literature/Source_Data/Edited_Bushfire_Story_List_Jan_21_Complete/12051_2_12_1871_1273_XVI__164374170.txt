 Caleb Thornton. CHAPTER XVI. 

 Tkeee was a public-house and a store where we camped, and here we procured some meat, which Vaughan broiled on an impromptu gridiron manufac tured, from some hoop iron he had picked up on the road. I can safely say that I had never before enjoyed a meal so much as I enjoyed this. No refinement of cookery ever imparted the flavour to chops with which the long walk and the clear air had whetted my palate to detect in those which Vaughan broiled over our bush fire ; no delicate bohea, sweet 

 ened with loaf sugar and toned down with cream, ever tasted so stimulative and grateful as our ' posts and rails,' sweetened with coarse dark sugar, and drunk out of a pannikin. My companion evidently read my thoughts, for he laughed and said, � ' Ah, my boy ; those swells at home, who think they know all about cookery, and are so learned in toothsome dishes and delicate wines, are all adrift. They don't know the enjoyment of eating and drinking � for they never eat and drink with the appetite of health 'and exercise. Another chop. Go in, old fellow : for we've got a long walk yet before we shall camp for the night.' Although we had known each other but a few hours, such was Vaughan s genial manner and frank behaviour that I forgot the shortness of our acquaintance ; and talked with him as unreservedly as if I had known him for years. While we were' eating, I gave him a brief account of my history � telling him all about the death of the old lord, the accession of the new, the death of Paddy and all the rest of it. I noticed that he listened with great interest, and that his face looked grave and pale. But he did not say anything, and presently, when we had finished our meal', slung his share of our swag across his shoulders, and announced that it was time to start. When -we had got half-way up the hill, he paused, ar.d looking about, walked a short distance into the bush, beckoning me to follow him. ' Now,' says he, taking off one of his boots ' You'd best give me your money. It is ten to one but some of Black Douglass's gang are about, or that infernal fellow Melville; though to be sure, they generally look nut for fellows going dotcn rather than up. Still, it is best to be careful.' With these v ords, he pressed the heel of his boot ?with Ids thumb, and to my surprise, the back part of it came awuy in his hand, disclosing a hollow in the heel. Taking the money, I handed it to him ; and returning me the silver� about 25s.� he put the rest into this hiding place, and readjusting the piece he had withdrawn, closed it with a snap. ' There,' said he, ' I fancy that is as good a dodge as any going. I had those boots made in Sydney when I came down from the Turan rush. If we meet with any of the gentlemen of the road they can't get at your capital unless they take my boots. And now let us be off.' We had entered the Forest, the road leading through the midst of huge trees blackened by periodical bush fireB. Being dry weather, the travelling was only tendered unpleasant by the dust ; but I could well understand Vaughan when he told me that in the wet season he had counted as many as thirty drays bogged in the Forest. ' I've known them six weeks getting up to the creek,' said he ; ' there's old ' Macedon ' for you to your right.' I looked in the direction he indicated, and beheld a high mountain, thickly covered with timber, and looking grand as it arose from the bosom of the forest. To the right and to the left of the path huge trees grew; and being spring time the foliage was fresh and luxuriant, while the earth was covered by springing grass. Not a sound met the ear, save, now and then, the tinkle of some bullock bell, ?while the dense bush shut out the sunlight. Such was the depressing character of the scene about us that it had a corresponding effect upon our spirits, and soon our conversation � hitherto sustained throughout our walk � gave way to silence. We came across few other travellers, and these we quickly distanced. t There is a valley about two miles on the Melbourne side of Woodend, through which a small creek runs, and here we paused a few moments to get a drink. We both stooped down to drink from the clear and sparkling rivulet, and on rising were surprised to find ourselves confronted by three men, who, at first glance, I understood to be desperate characters. ' Bail up, mates,' cried one fellow, a huge negro ; ' no humbug now ; off you go before us,' and he pointed down the valley. I glanced at Vaughan. ' Its no use, old fellow,' said he, ' come along ; ' and Lfollowed him in the direction indicated by the black. He and another man came after us, leaving the third on the road. We passed down the valley for about one thousand yards, coming at last to a small fire, around which were seated several people, five of ?whom were bound. A dray, loaded, was near, the horses belonging to which had been unharnessed, and ?were now browsing a short distance off. When we came up to the others, two men, evi dently belonging to the gang, came forward, and ?without further ceremony bound our hands behind us. Then they searched us, finding but a few shil lings upon my companion, and some eighteen shillings upon me. ' Curse it,' said the black, ' here's a pretty lot. Not �5 among 'em all. Hark, there's the office.' He darted off at full speed, followed by two of his companions, while we were ordered to sit down among the others. Presently the negro returned, and with him this time a chaise cart, in which I saw the young girl whom we had assisted on the road. She looked scared and frightened, while the honest fellow who owned the cart, 6wore roundly. He was quickly bound, however, and threatened that if he did not hold his his tongue they would gag him. He sat down beside me, growling curses, not loud but deep. The robbers then set to werk to rifle the cart ; an operation which its owner regarded with a grim re signation that, despite our unpleasant position, ex cited my laughter. One of the fellows going some distance from the camp brought in two horses, which they proceeded to load with the goods they took from the cart. The girl they did not molest, bidding her sit down on a log hard by. Presently, however, the negro went up to her, and sat beside her. Chucking her under the chin, he looked into her face, showing his white teeth as he laughed aloud. 'Aha, my pretty one,' he cried, 'so we have caged you. And where, pray, are you going.' He did not speak with the broken accent common to his race ; but on the contrary, as clearly and free from any distinguishing accent as any European ? even less so. Indeed, while his huge frame and thoroughly negro features excited repulsion, his voice and speech, if they did not do away with this feeling, modified it considerably. However, as he spoke and acted in this familiar manner to the poor young girl, we who sat around felt a feeling of disgust and anger towards the fellow. My companion, indeed, did not hesitate to express his opinion of the r.egro's conduct 

 a mistake that only excited that individual's anger, without effecting any good towards the girl. Coining up to Vaughan, he shook his fist in his face. ' Come, mj brave cock of the walk,' cried he ; ' you keep a civil tongue in your head, or I'll mighty soon cut it out. D'ye know who I am r ' ' Well,' said Vaughan, ' I've a pretty good notion ; but if you were the devil himself � and you're black enough to be him ? ha, you coward ! ' The negro had struck him full in the face, knock ing him off the log on to his back'; and thus he lay, for, being bound, he could not recover his position. ' There, you dog,' cried the negro, his eyes glaring with rage, and his white teeth set hard ; ' that for your impudence. Say another word, and I'll stop your mouth for ever.' With these words he turned away, and once more seating himself by the girl, put his arm around her waist, and swore she was the prettiest lass he had seen for many a day. ' Come,' said he, ' what say to share my fortune ? 'Tis a wild life, but you look a brave girl � come, you shall be mine, little bird.' He drew her towards him, and endeavoured to kiss her ; but, with a cry of horror she strove to repulse him ; while the child she carried in her arms, and who had hitherto been sleeping calmly, awoke, and began to cry. The black dragged the little thing from its mother's arms, and handed it to one of his companions, Who stood . regarding the scene with amusement and satisfaction . depicted on his coarse and brutal countenance. ' There, Jim, you'll make a good dry nurse. Take care of the brat until I've persuaded this lady that she cannot do better than come with me.' And again he endeavoured to embrace her. ' By heaven,' said Vaughan, whom I had helped back as well as I could to Ms seat on the log, ' I'd give a hundred guineas, if I had them, to have my hands free and a knife in one of them. If I would not settle that black fellow I'm a Dutchman.' The man to whom the cart and goods belonged, and who was next to me, overheard my companion, and touched me with his elbow. ' I've slipped one hand clear,' he whispered ; ' look out tor the others while I cut the rope round your wrists ; then you can do the same for your mate.' As he spoke he shifted close up to me, and passing one arm around me � for they had bound our arms behind us � quickly cut the cords by which I was fastened. Then he slipped the knife into my hands and I did the like office for Vaughan. ' Now,' said the man, 'I'll give the signal for a rush ; don't be in a hurry, and let each take his man.' 'Give me the nigger,' muttered Vaughan. 'I owe him one, and, by Jove, I'll pay him vrith in terest.' For myself, I had fixed my eye upon a small hatchet which had been used to chop the sticks for the fire, and which I determined to get hold of, if possible. There was one advantage we possessed, � and this was that the rascals were all so much en gaged in witnessing the negro's overtures to the girl, and the resistance she made, that they had not watched us very carefully. It is true there were five of them, and that in all probability they were armed, but I hoped that in the rush we made we might over come them ere they could make any resistance. At any rate it was worth the trial. CHAPTER XVII. Presently the negro made a sign to one of his men, who, going some distance away where several horses were tethered, brought one of them, saddled and bridled, to the place where we were all assembled. ' Now,' said the negro, ' my pretty pet, you shall come to my castle. Jem, you can bring the kid after.' With these words he arose, and grasping the girl by her waist, he placed one foot in the stirrup, and was about to mount, when our companion gave the signal. In an instant all were upon them. Vaughan grasped the negro by the throat, while I, catching up the hatchet, dealt a blow right and left, which floored two of the fellows. The other two stood for a moment paralysed. Then they rushed towards their horses, on which it would seem they had left their arms. Taking advantage of this, I cut the cords which bound the other men who had been bailed up ; and thus we stood, so to speak, three to one. But not one of us was armed. Those M-ho had carried weapons had been deprived of them when they were robbed ; and we therefore did not stand in a fair position; the more so that the two men who were stationed on the look out, alarmed by the shouts of their corn panions, came hurrying to the spot. However, it was no time to play craven, so we all seized what came first to hand, and stood determined to fight it out. Meanwhile the struggle had been going on between the negro and Vaughan, with advantage to neither, for they seemed well matched in strength. I was advancing to help my friend, when he cried out to look ' ' after the girl and the child. But I could see nothing of the latter, and our friend who had so kindly helped the poor woman on the road now looked after her again, and seizing her in his arms, mounted the horse and rode away with her towards the road. As he did so, one of the fellows, who were coming from that direction attempted to stop him ; but soon found out that he had made a mistake, for the honest fellow dealt the rascal a crushing blow upon his head, which completely knocked him over. He then galloped off. Seizing the opportunity, I ran forward and took the arms� or pair of double-barrelled pistols� from the prostrate robber, and ran back as fast as possible to the camp � arriving just as the other men came up, and were about to fire on my companions. With one shot I tumbled over the fellow who was foremost, and covering the second, gave time to one of our side to get the gun with which the man I had shot was about to fire. This was ?well, and our success so checked the other fellows that they balked. At this moment, by a vigorous effort, the black cast Vaughan from him, and stood midway between his men and us. For a moment he glared wildly at us, then turning, he called out ' Run boys � the traps are on us,' and fled towards the horses. As they did so, my ears caught the sound of horses coming towards the road, and presently half a dozen troopers dashed into the camp. A glance at us, and a few words I shouted out, told them how matters stood, and they rushed after the fellows. I now turned to Vaughan, who, half choked and wholly insensible, lay upon the ground. The negro had got such a hold upon his throat that he had nearly throttled him, and it was some moments and only after I had plentifully sprinkled his face with water that he came round. Meanwhile the other men had tied two of the fellows who had been knocked over ; the third managed to escape. As for the man I had shot, he was done for, the bullet having gone through his heart. As I looked at him, his teeth firmly clenched, and his dull eyes glaring upwards, I ex perienced that awful sense of responsibility, -which, as I believe, ever comes to him who takes human life, under any circumstances and however justifiably. But there was no time to moralise, and Vaughan having recovered sufficiently to walk, we determined to push on to Woodend. One of the men found the child behind a bush, where it had been hastily cast by the man to whom, the negro had given it. We were puzzled as to what we should do with it, and at last determined to take it on with us to Woodend. We collected the stores 

 and articles which, were scattered about the ground, and put them into the cart, to which, we harnessed the horse, and into which we also bandied the two fellows we had bound ; leaving their companion's dead ;body where it was. Then we got back to the road, and pushed on to the township. This was not very far away, and when we reached it we found that die owner of the cart had arrived safely with the, girl. She, however, had swooned, and was still in sensible when we arrived. I really think the honest fellow -who' had rescued her was more overjoyed to placejier babe by her side than to find his cart and goods brought safe to him. The little thing had not been much hurt by its fall ; and when, presently, the poor mother recovered her consciousness, and clasped it to. her breast, there was not a dry eye among the rough but good fellows who stood around. I need not say how the poor mother thanked her preserver, and indeed all of us ; nor how happy we all were that night, as we sat around the fire in the rough buBh hotel, and over our pipes and grog recalled the circumstances of the affray. The police came in about midnight having been unsuccessful in arresting the rascalB whom, however, they had chased to the base of Mount Macedon. Here they lost them, for in the gullies and ravines they had so many hiding places that it was next to impossible� the more so that it was night� to follow them tip further. They brought in the dead body of the bushranger I had shot, and took charge of the others ; serving us with notice that -we should have to remain at Kyneton� the next township� to give evidence against them. This was annoying because we had hoped to have got to Forest Creek the next day. However, it could not be helped, and this was the only philosophy that could console us. * The next day we were conveyed in � waggon to Kyneton, and there the police magis trate' at once entered into the investigation. This -did not' last long, nor did the Coroner's, inquest, and when the proceedings were over, we were all bound over to appear in evidence at the next sittings of the Criminal Court at Forest Creek. This done, 'we pushed on, and arrived at Post-office Hill ob the eve of the same day. Here 'we all parted with those with whom we had become bo strangely associated, Vaughan and I remaining together, for we had determined to work together. The man who had so pluckily rescued the poor girl camped near us, and carried his good will so far as to offer the young mother (to whom he seemed to have become attached as a father might well feel towards a poor friendless girl), shelter, until she dis covered her husband. As there were then many thousands of diggers on the field, scattered from Post office Hill as far as Campbell's Creek, this was a matter of no little difficulty. But she met with a great -deal of assistance from the diggers, and at last found the object of her search. It would have been better had she never found him, for she discovered him faithless to her', living with another woman, and go heartless and lost to good feeling that he repu diated her, and forbade her to come near him. Broken hearted, she came back one evening, her babe upon her breast, and told us her sad story. �' Hang it,' cried Shorter � the name of her good friend. 'The cowardly hound. Never mind, little woman, I'll not desert you. After all, you're well nd of the skunk.'
