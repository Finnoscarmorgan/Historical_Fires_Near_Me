 after waiting .move' than a lmsbnable time and hearing nothing of it, enquiries mad� resulted in the discovery that hy some accident- or carelessness 'they had been entirely overlooked, and; heilig of a -perishable nature, were completely .spoiled. 'Of course, no one wasiohlatne in the matter, and no redress could be obtained, and the icn�wledg� of this lent aiv additional, tinge. of bitterness to Ralph's thoughts, and inspired his un- 

 patriotic denunciation of the Govern'-" ment'of his country. 

 Added to all other causes of discomfi- ture,'the -weather was intensely hoi; and oppressive. It had been a diy-eeasbn, unusually so for Gooram Gooram dte tricb-^w�ncb is saying a good deal-and the parched, dry condition of ^"every- thing wasi painfully obtrusive. 

 Not ar.hreath of wind was stirring.' The" sun was at its' fiercest, and the atmosphere was rendered/nfore d�as�bp oppressive by .reason" of a" large, bush fire which had been burning for days l�asi in 'the'butlyihg forests'. . 'i : / 

 .'Ralph-st�tyed lils horses for a uioment ; bi' tWb ki the - end 'o. a ��ng 'fniuvow, while" he wiped his' hot .face j�nd hieck, and., hurled a jfew anathemas mtr> the swarms ,bf tormenting flies which fol- ' lowed him .with such untiring -drowsy persistence. . .... /.!'. 

 .'��n't sw�ar, Ralph.- " Linda says it's wicked, you know, or, at, -any rate, '.coarse and- -vulgar,' which, is aluioat as bad/'aaid.a iroi^e somewhere above his head. . " . '' :,r ., . 

 Ralph looked ? up, ^covering the Owner of the ^�icebqmfortahly ensc 

 �u;^e higher branches of .an immense 

 gumlee, whosPr�o^�B^E^^ifeleaTC�;

 ." What on. eai-tb > ar� yo� fooling. up there for, Clyde ?" said Ralph, crossly. 

 "l'ai not on earth ; I'�i in the air what there is of it," said Clyde meekly. 

 "Don't -he a fool," retorted the eider brother. " Come down oat of that, you great oaf. Why are you hot attending to that broken wire netting I told you of, iustead of climbing trees like an idiotic native bear ?" 

 " I was only following the example of my elder," returned' Clyde in tha sams meekly submissive tones. 

 " � have seen you up here rather often, trying to get a bird's eye view of a small house nearly fourteen miles away. You "need not waste your energies iu blush- ing, Ralph. It s quite true." ' 

 Ralph" might have* blushed at the hoine-tbrust dealt him by the other, but his -fane was already of so brilliant a hue that the most vivid blush could hardly have added to the colour. 

 , ;"You ai� making an infernal lass of yourself," was bis answer, "and wasting time, too,'which is more to the purpose. You know very well if the rabbits get into that" paddoc^*'i�bere'*v��^l}� a stalk of wheat ..left' to cut by the'ead bf the

 " Fsbaw, are you going to mend that fence or not, or do you expect me to do all the wor]c in"the place ? 

 "You. seem-fond enough of it, wheat you gp ploughing on �ach a day^a� this/' ;

 of the paddock again. - - . 

 ! "Ralph, cpnie u� here foi* a minute," said Clyde s voice hom his lofty perch, l as his Jirother came within hearing 

 distance. 

 " Nonsense, -Clyde, I am in no mood ior fooling if, you are." j

 A few miles from it's-South-Eastern houndary, lay Rhyll Farm, and Ralph's eyes turned anxiously in that direction. - 

 . Beyond Rhyn Farm, nearer to the line of fire, lay liiany scattered hom'3ste;ids, the hardly won houses of small fji-mers or fruitgrowers.

 Listen, there is Linda ringing the bell ] for one of- us '' ; then with .a sudden change of toae,X3lyde called out sharply " Hold firm Ralph, here's the wind." 

 Here it was i�deed with a vengeance. A low shuddering sough, and then a tremendous blast, hot a3 from the mouth of a furnace, caught them, and the brothers had to put out both strength aud skill to retain their hold, as the huge ti<ee swayed and SIIOD�C in the sudden onslaught 

 Great volumes of deas3 smoke were ?borne upon the hot breath of the wind, stinging the eyes and nitrite, obscuring tlie view, and proving uumhJ�kahly that the course of the fiery fiend had com- pletely changed. 

 " My God, Clyde, that fire will travel twenty miles an hour iu this wind, and she alone ! What could that old fool b? thinking pf to leave her ?" 

 Clyde looked at his brother. The dark sunburned face had assumed an ashy grey colour, the sfcroug muscular frame seemed to relax its-teutipn,' and. grow lim� and .inert as the man's iuragiiiatipn 'realised the rwfuij' danger menacing' tlie woman beloved.7'' ?,- * ? ' 

 The Shook, of. th's sudden knowledge, added .to-the ie.iiijful heat of ;the movning� '�nd Ihe" violent swaying, pf the .ty��'tq which he had h�en clinging, made him positiyely-iU, and turning h is head aside, Ralph Pirron beat tfor a minute or two in the dgouies of a violent sichuess. 

 " Toa have had a touch pf the suu,"old lad," said the younger mau, as bis brother recovered himself. "Go into the house and ses what Reuben has come for. I MU take in the hprses." 

 �Reuben had come over-much against Ins will it appeared-T-with a message from Mrs! Pordyce, �askihg that "one "pf the ypiingi; mpn -wbul^ gp a^id ; stay-at Rhyu-Farm for a day or two, as she felt nervous alone. , ' 

 -'.Poor thing, I should tiring said b�th,;Mr�..Garron-and; her daughter. ~" "Why did you not hiing her hfcre ?" 

 " Why ?" growled Reuben, " Cos' she's one of they fule woaie� who will go their own way. Thinks the fire's- too f ai- OBD for danger, and wants to stop lu the old 

 crib until she's forced t' Iteave it." 

 " Ton had no business to leave her," said Ralph sharply. "You could have fpiuid some other messenger surely. Maggie jcould have ridden over for that f; "0iix^t say �bout that,- Mister Garron," o^f^J-^ ^ptU�r... " Maggie's off, to -1iibni%^-^>�' .�iffi�3&is". morning. - Her .|iouib*s :ten "uiles "nearer the fire than Rbya; and she'cthohght W^ol�/'tdiotiiejr' '� ;^>i^ 4%b^^ ;

 ." Yes, yes, 1 know, Ralph," she said, 

 with quick1, inatin��lave. sympathy, but" 

 it is .a'4�ttg i�d�^aiid you will be ill if jroa go "fasting. ' You know you were, ibo iwpw�editp eat �-your breakfast this ' .morning.;' ' Sit. down., and ' h�ve. ' your dinner, aud Reuben and I will get Light fppt ready for'you. .Copi�,' you must, br. mother will fret until you get back." 

 Ralph yielded, and the- old mau and girl wentnput together. But Ralph could 

 not eat:' 

 ? : "-Potftniind Mother," he said apolo- geticly, "R's tob hot to eat, and I will get something at Rhyn you know. Put nie up a bottle bf tea, I shall be glad of a drink along the road this weather. Good Lord, what is that ? 

 " That " was a thundering rattle and crash, like the roar"of artillery, heard above tho loud bellowing of the wind, and followed by a mad confusion of white atoms, being - bourne wildly through the smoke-laden atmosphere. 

 Both mother and son rushed to the door, where Clyde dashed up to them. 

 " Ralph, Ralph." he shouted, " the barn is blown down, and the store fodder will be all goneiu another minute, unless we ean manage td' saeure it with tar- 

 paulin?." 

 .1 The "store fodder," the only thing they depended on to keep the cattle alive 

 during the long hot months which w�rjf' .yet. remaining of Bje^summer weather* �*�'or Ralph j: once inor� duty and long^ ;|njf \\^^'-hi�i;.fe|^tl�3ply'. hi different ..flirec^�^/'^an�-. for yt!be space . pf a moment he stood irresolute, only a single instant one glance at the parched," giassless earth, another at the careworn, Anxious face of. his mother, and Ralph . Gairon sprang after his t>robher, feeling that Clyde could do kothing single-handed in such a gaie.7 

 Singlehanded!. T^eU' iiriited efforts twerp'ahriost'f utile against th� '.ruad, wind, which-Hbre the. coverings'�rom .their 

 grasp and flung them remorselessly'; 

 kbout their heads au&faces. : J 

 and pM_ R�^^ wo�d jipoh'j�he r�tr&�ljory f^patdiris, whilst the- bathers drove strong-stakes into the-ground, fastening the coveriugs-to them securely. 

 It was done at last, the greater part of the precious'food secured and saved. But. it had taken them mora than an hom:, and it was past one o'clock before Ralph and Reuben rode away in the direction of Rliyn Farm.
