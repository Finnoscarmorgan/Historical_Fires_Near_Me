THE YOUNG VENTRILOQUIST. 

 [Ih Seven Chapters.] CHAPTER V. 

 Tho place where Briscoe had hidden himself waB a thicket of Bhrubs � lilac, calacanthus and Scotch broom� which grew in one corner of the yard. It hod originally been planted to cut off from view tho short row of cabins which were the quarters of tho house-servants. With time and neglect the bushes had spread enormously, rioting at will, and matting and tangling into an almost impenetrable jungle. In his trouble, Briscoe lind pushed hia way in amonir them, as a wounded animal mioJit; Vintm 

 done, seeking covert, nnd when his first paroxysm of distress had died down he continued to He among them, prone on tho earth, with a sense of being sheltered in privacy by the close-set stems about him, and the interlocked branches above. Sounds caine to him from time to time from the cabins, all of which were occupied. He could hear the clash of cooking utensila, the tinkling of thoughtless laughter ; and above all, dominating all, the singing of a woman to her child and the jog-jogging of the cradle as she rocked it with her foot. There came also to the boy the drone of conver sation, guttural and indistinct, like the buzzing of bumblebees. This drew nearer, accompanied by the shuffling of feet. Two negro men were slouching about, aud talking together in undertones. They passed round the thicket to the side farthest from the cabins, and sat down close to the place where Briscoe lay hidden. At any other time tbe demon of mischief within the boy would have seized upon the opportunity for a practical joke, but now all thought of tricks was far from him. He felt no impulse to startle the negroes, nor, indeed, to make his presence known to them. For the moment he forgot all about his gift. He was reminded of it in a way unexpected and terrible. The men spoke low but distinctly, and every word and sentence made its way into the thicket. At first the boy paid little heed. Then a word or two caught hiB attention, and he rolled over silently aud listened. Once or twice he had to strangle a nervous desire' to laugh ; but soon horror fell on him like a black pall, nnder which he cowered with every faculty merged into that of hearing. The men he knew intimately. One was a bright mulatto named Tom Snead, who was employed about the lot and attended to tho doctor's horses. The other was Shadrach Adams. They were recapitulating the happenings of the j previous weeks, eagerly, fiercely, and as men who had met for a purpose. The tricks the boy had played, every foolish imitation and imposition of which he had beenguilty, was recalled and attributed to the influence of conjure-charma and demoniac machinations. Terror and superstition, twin-born of ignorance, together with a desire for revenge, had brought the men to tha disposition of tigers. Suggestion and accusation, winged and fanged by fear, arose to circle and settle sullenly down upon one name. In the opinion of these two men it was Joel Brent, the blacksmith, who was guilty of thiB treason against his race ! It was Joel who lay concealed, and with sorcery and conjuration, handed down to liim from Guinea coast ancestors, brought confusion and death to the people 1 Had not these strange happenings originated in Joel's own shop P Had not the first laughter of devils echoed from under the hood of his forge ? Since then had there been any peace in the land ? Were hot women and children afraid to go about their business, even in the daytime ? Did not terror hug closely the hearts of the men ? Was not Shadrach's own wife dead from the effectB of vile sorcery ? Was not another man's child sick of a curious complaint, which must have its origin in witchcraft ? Whose life was Bafe ? Who could hold himBelf exempt from spells ?' ; So they argued, excitingone another, spurring one another on. Then they drew closer and spoke lower, and Shadrach disclosed a scheme ot vengeance so awful that tbe listener felt his heart bound, and the sweat break out in beads all over him. A dozen or more negroes were to meet at Shadrach's house in an hour, and from thence proceed to the black smith's quarters. They were to go silently. There would be no moon. The houae was to be surrounded, and alBO the shop, for there was no telling in which place the conjurer did his work, and kept the nefariouB thingB he worked with. . The 'doors and windows were to be nailed, so as to prevent escape. Then Btraw and brushwood, deluged with oil, wore to he piled about both buildings and fire set to them. The boy waited to hear no more. An awful sense of responsibility was on him. This was his work � his, and no other'B ! A man was to be put to death horribly because of hie folly 1 A man who had faithfully served his own family � who had brought his father home from the battlefield and nursed and tended him ; who had been good to Briscoe himself all the days of his life. This man, about whom clustered tender and kindly associations and memories, was to be roasted alive because he, Briscoe Llewellyn, had played senseless tricks, like a monkey ! All this jumbled together in his mind confnsedly, Hia excitement pumped the blood into his brain ao faat that he could not think connectedly. Two things only were clear to him : one, that he must save Joel, and the other that he muBt keep all this, as much as might be, away from his father. The surgeon bad said that a shock might prove fatal. For the first time in his life, responsibility | and thought for others were impressing their necessity upon the boy. All that was truest and finest in his unformed character had sudden growth. Swiftly, sinuuusly, with noiseleEB undnlationB.he wriggled his way out of the thicket. The woman sang on, high and sweet as a mocking-bird, and rocked the pradle with her foot. BriBcoe could see her in the lamplight which streamed through her doorway. He crouched low, and hugged the shadow of the bushes for fear she might see him. Tho shortest way to Joel's shop lay across fields and a little pine barren. He knew every foot of it, and must speed. The men were to meet; at Shadrach'3 in an hour, and Shadrach's was but a scant quarter of a mile from the shop. Briscoe had a mile and a half to travel ; and alao tbe difficulty ahead of making Joel undnriand his danger and willing to run away from it. He held his arms close to his sides and ran with hiB head lowered and a bit forward. He was a strong lad, and enduring. Instinctively he thru6fc away all thought and clinched to his wprk, running as he had never run before. The stars overhead looked dim and far off, and the low breeze sighed like wind in his ears. Once he stumbled and fell, bruising his hand and wrenching hia shoulder. He sprang to his feet again, feeling no pain. Then, because instinct iB stronger than anything that can be brought against it, and humanity's instinct iB towards supplication, the boy began praying ; not audibly, but in his heart � 'God help me to save hira ! God help rae to save him !' over and over, with the one variation � ' Keep back tho others ! Keep back the others 1' As he prayed, the thought of his father came into his mind, and of that gallant charge which had turned the tide of battle. Tho exultation of it seemed to pulse in his own veins, to stir his oxtn heart. The light from Joel's Bupper fire showed dynly in the cabin, making evident the man's wboi'cabouts. The shop looked dark and deserted, a mere blot of blackness against a pale background of sky. 

 Joel himaelf was sitting in the doorway with his dog at his feet. The dim light from the interior - barely outlined his figure, but Briscoe saw him - before ho had .fairly scrambled over the clearing fence. His first impulse was to call out, but a - sudden fear of his own voice mastered him. He was exhausted and well-nigh breathless. Suppose he should not be able to control it, and his call should wander afield and seem to Joel to come from the infinite ? That would put the man in a panic. .Fierce revolt against his own gift, and the straits into which it had brought him, surged through the boy as he dashed silently across the clearing. Then Joel's dog rushed to meet him, barking furiously, and Joel himself callcd out from the doorway to know who it was and what. might bo the matter. Briscoe reached up to the water pail on the shelf and drank feverishly. His tongue was dry and his throat felt blistered. When both should be moistened he would be better able to keep that weird gift of his under control. Then Briscoe told his story rapidly and clearly. When the situation was made plain to Joel his anger flamed like a brush-fire, and in the heat of it his own superstition, for the moment, shrivelled away. He dashed his hat on the ground, and cursed hia erstwhile friends and neighbours: Knowing himself innocent of necromancy � more, having fancied himaelf tho victim of it � the popular attitude which fastened opprobrium upon him seemed outrageous and infamous. The more he blazed out at his neighbours, the hotter grew hfs wrath and the more set he was on bidding them a proud defiance. Briscoe had much ado to dissuade him from loading up his old shot gun, so as to give his assailants a taste of their own prescription. ' Gwine kill me, is dey ?' he foamed. ' Gwine bu'n me up liftc one rattlesnake in a hollow log, is dey ? Ne'er mind ! Joel gwine fix trap fur 'em� gwine make some on 'em sample brimstone, mun !' Briscoe felt as though he would go distracted. In plucking himself from one horn of the dilemma ho bade fair to become impaled on anothor. Any killing which might result from his trickB would lie at his door. He caught his brenth in a hard sob. The consequences of his impishnesa seemed so terrible and far-reaching. He tried to work on Joel's humanity and his religion, but to little purpose. A recently, die covered intention on the part of the public to roast a man alive is not conducive to the development of Christian virtues in the proposed victim. Then Briscoe did the common-Bense thing of appealing to the man's discretion. What good would it do to shoot one assailant, or two even ? There would be a mob � a dozeu and more � Shadrach had said so. Joel would be shot himself, or brained, or worse than all, burned with fire, notwithstanding his resistance. What could one man do against numbers P He was a stark idiot to dream of resistance. Far better hide, and when the house and shop were found deserted, the mob would disperse without doing damage. At this juncture the dog growled, low down in his throat, and Joel set his gun aside and glanced about, like a rat in a trap. Recollection of the race habit of subordination flashed through the boy's mind liko an inspiration. ' Come away !' he ordered, peremptorily. ' Come away at once ! They'll be here in a minute, and mustn't find us 1' Joel hesitated an instant, and then yielded. In the cabin the fire had died down to a faint hearth-glow, and the place was full of shadows. Briscoe shut the door, and then the pair slunk away, through the dimness, followed closely by the dog, who seemed uneasy. They croased the clearing on the side opposite the path leading from Shadrach's house, and entered the woods, where the land lifted in a slight rise. Briscoe wanted to go home at once, and return iu the morning to discover the fate of the cabin. He was unstrung, mind and body, and had had quite enough of excitement. But Joel would not hear of it. All his personal effects, the accumulation of years, and that which to him represented competence and good living, was within the walls of hia cabin and shop. If he might not defend them, he would, at least, remain close enough to see what became of them. He was not afraid of the other negroes stealing his things. The fear of witchcraft was too strong upon them for that. They would fear that they might steal bad luck. Briscoe and Joel crouched down behind a ledge of rocks and waited. The night was too dim even to distinguish objects near at hand. They strained their sight into the darkness until their eyeballs' ached. Then the dog began to growl again, and Joel caught hi3 muzzle in his hand and held it. One moment � two � an eternity seemed to pass. Then there was a slight grating noise, as of metal slipping upon metal. To leES intensified senses it would not have been audible at that distance. The negroes were screwing together the doora and windows. Then a blaze Bhot upward, lurid and horrible, licking through a pile of oil-soaked straw and brushwood, and leaping to the dry eaves of the buildings, which were old and lichened, and as inflammable as tinder. In a few moments both houseB were in flames, crackling and roaring and casting fire and sparks upward. The flare made the clearing as brilliant as noonday. The conspirators, frightened at their own deed, now that it was in process of accomplish ment, huddled together in the background, keeping in the shadow of a gum-tree and bracing their nerves for the shriek of human agony which they felt sure must break out presently. Even Shadrach, the prime instigator in tbe outrage, fell Bilent, and watched the flames leap heavenward with anxious eyes. Ab the roof of first one building and then the other fell in, tbe negroes began to steal noiselessly away. Briscoe, on the hillside, battled with a great temptation. He longed to throw his voice among the cowardly gang, to hurl words at them, and laughter, that would curdle tbe blood in their veins. He could paralyze them with terror simply by opening hiB lips. ' But he held the temptation under. He had done ? harm enough. Manly, helpful inBtinctB were getting possession of him. Tha thought of his father came to him again, and he laid one hand over his mouth, holding himself silent. The other he thrust in his breast. (To be continued.)
