 ' There is something in the -wind to-day, old fellow,' he said, addressing his horse. ' There is something in the wind. Yet where is the wind?' for John Fane had. long looked upon his horse as a com panion, and considered that the dumb beast understood -'*�i. The perspiration streamed from him with 

 then mounting him he roused up his cattle. Horses, dogs, and cattle manifested a lretlessness that only the extraordinary con dition of the atmosphere could produce. Then started the whole trooop, man, horse, dogs, and cattle, soberly and slowly along as if they were oppressed by a great fatigue or the extreme exhaustion of famine. The forest closed in upon them again, and they proceeded along a narrow track flanked on each side by tall and densely growing trees ; the creeping vines making the whole forest one intricate, impenetrable scene. All was hushed as at midnight j no bird enli vened the solitude by its cries, and they had left the little stream. Suddenly there came a puff of air, but it ?was like the air from the jaws of a furnace � hot, dry, withering in its very touch. The young settler, looking quickly in the direction from whence it came, instantly shouted in a wild, abrupt, startling shout to the cattle, swung aloft the stockwhip 'which he held in his hand, and brought it down with the report of a pistol and a sharp cut as with a knife on the bullock before 'hfm. The stockwhip, with a handle about half a yard long and a thong of three yards of plaited bullock hide, is a terrible instrument in the hands of a practical stockman. Its sound is the note of terror to the cattle. It is like- the report of a blunderbuss, and the stockman at full gallop will hit any given spot on the beast that he is within reaeh of, and cut the piece clean away from the thickest hide that bull or bison ever wore. Louder and louder, wilder and more fiercely shouted the man, and dashed his horse for ward over fallen trees, crashing through - thickets, first on one side of the road and then on the other. Crack, crack 'went the stinging slashing 'whip, loud was the bark of the dogs, and the mob of cattle rushed forward at a headlong speed. Hotter, hotter, stronger, and more steadily came the wind. John Fane sud denly checked his horse, and listening, grew pale at the sound which reached him. It was a low deep roar, as of a wind in the tree tops, or of a heavy waterfall distant and smothered in some deep ravine. ' God have mercy !'' he exclaimed ; ' a bush fire, and in this thick forest.' Once more he sprang forward shouting, thundering with his whip, he and the herd galloping along the narrow track. The idea of beiug overtaken by a bush fire was horrible. Such an event would be death, and death only. Therefore he urged on his flying herd with desperation. The roar of the fire came louder, and ever and anon seemed to swell and surge as if urged on by a rough rising blast. The heat was fierce and suffocating. John Fane's clothes clung to him with the steaming perspiration. The horse and cattle steamed and smoked with boiling heat. Yet onward, onward they dashed with lolling tongues. He knew the extraordinary heat and drought of the summer had scorched up the jgrass, the very ground � had licked up the water from the crab-holes, pools, and many a creek ; had withered the herbage into crisp hay, and so dried up the foliage that it crumbled between the fingers. If the fire reached* him and his herd before they were in the open plains they must be consumed like stubble. The cattl.9 were beginning already to show signs of fatigue, hanging out their parched tongues and panting heavily, the sweat on himself and horse was dried up by the awful heat, and che dogs ran silently on whining lowly to themselves as they hunted every hollow on their way for water. Suddenly they were out in the open plain, yet with the forest on either side, but at a considerable distance. What a scene ! The woods were flaming and cracking in one illimitable conflagration. The wind dashing from the nor^^n. .gusts of inconceivable heat Beefl3pdrifco8tsear the very face and shrivel up the lungs. The fire leaped from tree to tree, flashing and roaring with the Bpeed and destructiveness of lightning. There was the sound of thunder mingled with the crash of falling trees and the wild cries of legions of birds of all kinds, which fell scorched, blackened, and dead to the ground. Oncejout on the plain the cattle became lost in the blinding smoke, and John Fane was obliged to abanden them and make a dash onward, closely followed by his faithful dogs. Now the flames came racing along the grass with the speed of the wind, now it tore furiously through some near point of the forest, and flung burning ashes- and tangles of blazing bark upon the galloping rider. But -his horse, with instinct more infallible than human sagacity, sped on over thicket and stone and -fulling trees, snorting in the thick masses of smoke, and; stretch ing forward hia gaping jaws as if to catch every breath of air to sustain impeded respiration.- ^ When the wind veered round it revealed 

 a most amazing scene � the blazing skirts * of forests, huge isolated trees glaring red, ^ standing columns of fire 5 here a vast troop ^ of wild horees, with' flying manes and tails, * rushing with thundering- hoofs over the ^ plain 5 herds of cattle running, 'with blood- ' shot eyes and hanging tongues, they knew J not whither from the fire ; numberless kan- ^ garoos leaping frantically across the rider's ^ path, birds -5� all kinds and colors shrieking ' piteously as they drove wildly by and yet 3 saw no spot of safety, thousands of sheep ' standing huddled in terror on the scorched ^ flats deserted by their shepherds who had : fled for their lives. J Onward flew the intrepid Prince with his ^ rider. At last came the welcome sight of ' the gleaming waters of Lake Oolac, into ] ?which rushed the horse, -wading hastily up - to his sides in the cooling flood. - John Fane J checked Tiim not as he thrust his head down J and drank as if he never could be satisfied. ' An Englishman new to the scene would ] have trembled for the safety of his horse , ' but the bush steed knows best what he ' wants, eats and ^y?nlr� as he likes, and : flourishes on it. Smoking hot the rider lets [ him drink his fill and all goes welL The J heat produces sweat, and tihe evaporation ' cools and soothes him. John Fane did not ' lose a moment in following bis horse's ; example. He flung himself' headlong from : the saddle dressed as he was, dived and ; splashed, and drank of the cooling water. He held his smarting face and singed hands '. in it, then threw it over his Bteed, that now ' satiated stood panting in the flood. He laved and rubbed down the grateful animal \\ with -wave after wave, cleaning the dried sweat from every hair and giving him re- : freshment at every pore. Then up and ' away again. ' ; He had not ridden 200 yards before he was attracted by one of his dogs to a horse '? lying on the plain, that had fallen in saddle and bridle and. lay with his legs under him, his head stretched stiffly forward, with glaring eyeballs, but dead. Near him a man, alive, but sunk in exhaustion. His eyes turned wildly on John Fane, and Vii� parched lips moved, but without a sound. John Fane . comprehended his need, and running to the lake filled his hat with water and put it to his mouth. It was the water of life to him. TTja voice and some degree of his strength came quickly back. He had come I from the north, and had ridden a race with ths fire till horse and.man had dropped there, the horse never to rise again. But need was too urgent for delay, John Fane, there fore, throwing away his rug and provisions, so as to lighten his horse, mounted the stranger behind him and rode on. CHAPTER XIX. Mount Hesse. 'Thank God! Fane. I am glad to see you have returned, old fellow,' said Jack Carey, as John Fane rode up to Mount Hesse with his burden. ' I hope you have not suffered much.' ' Not much, Carey. I have lost all my cattle ; but I fear this poor fellow is much burnt. I picked him up at Lake Oolac, and - I think he will require a little looking after.'' ' Thank you so much, sir, for the service you have rendered me. I trust some day it may lie in my power to return it,' said the stranger, addressing John Fane. � I am only too pleased to think I was in ? time to save you, and my horBe was good. May I inquire your name P' ' Henry King, at your service, sir.' ' Well, King,' said Jack Carey, 'I think the best thing you can do is to follow me, and see if we can do anything in the way of easing those bums.' *' By Jove ! Carey,' said John Fane, ' where on earth do all the people come from ? and is the fire so bad as that to drive so many here?' ' So it seems. I believe we are one of the only places as yet untouched by it. , You have had a narrow escape though, and you may certainly thank your horse for your safety. He is a splendid brute,' continued Carey, stroking the animal's neck. ' Hand him over to Bob ; he will put him up for you.' ' Eight. Have you had any news of the Turcerns, Carey ?' asked John Fane. ' None, Fane ; but I hope and believe that they are quite safe. They have long ago adopted our plan of a clearance-ring, and I doubt not are juet now aa much a centre of refuge aa we are.' 'I should like to be sure, Carey,' said John Fane, serioudy. ' Til ride over, and see.' ' Look here, Fane. If needs must, let one of the men go, there are plenty at hand ; you must be done. I would go myself, but my hands are full with the station.'* ' I would rather go. Suppose anything has happened to George or Miss Turcern, some one responsible would be required to guide the men.' . Within the last three or nearly four years there had been constant intercourse between the stations of Messrs. Dean, Carey* and Turcern with John,' Fane. Mount Hesse, from whose summit can be seen the distant waters of Lake Corangamite, belonged to the Careys. There were only three in family � old Mr. Carey, his wife, and son Jack; John Carey was one of the earliest settlers of that district, and through .hard work and sheer persistency had made the station' one of the leading ones of the district. Jack principally conducted, the business . for his father, who was an old man and a pensioner from her Majesty's service. . \\ . ' At that time what a scene presented itself. The station was. like a fair. From 

 he whole country around people had fled iom the fire 5 and had instinctively fled vith the feeling that the Careys' precau ionB, which they themselves had neglected, yere the guarantees of safety. Thither shep lerds had driven their flocks, stockmen their lerds, and whole families, compelled to fly irorn their burning houses, had hurried Mther with the few effects they could match up and bear with them. Mr. Carey's ] paddocks were crowded with horses and cattle, the bush around his station was literally hidden beneath his own and his leighbors' flocks. Shepherds, stockmen, sub stantial squatters, now houseless men, were in throngs. Families with troops of chil Iren had encamped on the open ground near hia house beneath temporary tents. Mount Hesse was crammed with fugitives^ md -was one scene of crowding confusion md sorrow. Luckily the store-room was well stocked with flour, and there could be 10 want of meat with all those flocks and iierds about them. But for the cattle them selves there must soon be famine ; and the moment that the fire abated scouts must be sent off in all directions, especially to the high plains around Lake Corangamite, in search of temporary pasture. Meantime fires were lighted in a dozen places, and kettles and frying-pans fully employed, for in spite of flight, loss, and grief, hunger, as Homer a thousand years ago asserted, '?' is impudent and will be fed.' The stories people had to tell were most melancholy. Children suffocated in the smoke or lost in the rapid flight ; shepherds and bullock irivers consumed with their stock. Num bers had fled to creeks and pools, and yet bad been severely burnt, the flames driving 0 ver the surface of the water with devour , . ing force. Some had lain in shallow brooks turning over and over, till finally forced to get up and fly. Still, as this terrible day � February 6 � wore on, numbers came pouring in with fresh tales of horror and devasta tion. The -whole country appeared to be a prey to the flames ; and men who a f ew hours bsfore were out of the reach of poverty and calamity were now homeless paupers. ' ' Good-bye, Carey ; get Bob to give a look to Prince for me, as I -want, if possible, to start for home to-morrow.' So saying, John Fane mounted on a fresh and powerful horse, cantered on towards Mount Turcern. It was only six miles from Mount Hesse. The hot north wind had ceased to blow, the air was cooler, the fires in the forests were burning more tamely. Yet, he had to ride over a track which showed him the ravages the fire had made in the -woods. The -whole of the grass was consumed, the dead timber lying on the around was still burning, and huge hollow Ixees stood like great chimneys with flames issuing from their tops as from a furnace. John Fane was about to cross a small creek when he saw an TTTnTiTnn.ii � a shepherd of the Careys � sitting on its banks. His clothes were nearly all con sumed from his back, his bat was the merest fragment, scorched and shrivelled. The man was rocking himself to and fro, and groaning. ' Pat 1' exclaimed John Fane, ' what has happened to you ?' The man turned upon him a visage that startled him with terror. It was no longer a human face, but a scorched and swollen mass of deformity. The beard and hair ?were burnt away ; the eyes were not visible, the whole face being amass of red flesh and hanging blisters. The poor fellow raised a pair of hands that displayed equally the dreadful work of the fire. 'Good God!' he exclaimed. ' Let me give you a hand, Pat, and take you home,' he continued, dismounting and going up to the poor wretch. The man groaned again, and opening t'g distorted mouth with difficulty, and with agony, said: ' Faix, I have no home ; sure if s burnt.' 'And your family ?' � Dead ? all dead !' ' But are you sure, quite sure P said John Fane, excitedly; ' Sure I. saw one, me eldest boy : he was lving burnt near the house. I lifted him to carry him away, but he said, ' Lay me down, father, lay me down ; I can't bear it.' I laid him down, and asked, ' Where are the rest ?' .* All gone into the bush,' he said ; and then he died. They are all burnt.' John Fane gave the wretched man a handkerchief, bidding Tiim dip it in. the creek and lay it on his face to keep the air from it, and then mounted his horse, saving he would look for the family.
