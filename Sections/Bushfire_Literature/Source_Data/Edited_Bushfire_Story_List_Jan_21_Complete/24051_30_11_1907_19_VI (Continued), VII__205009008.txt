 ' CHAPTER VI.� (Continued.) 

 By M. FORREST. 

 Wlicn Ben, showing no pai-ticulni- desire for his wife's company, had gone to explore the town, she found a long squatter chair 011 the balcony, looking towards tire hills, already enveloped in a grey haze forecast ing a hot day. Below lay thu iron roofs and the buildings of tire Great Northern 

 Railway station, and beyond bouses und many hotels und the timbered country. It seemed to Curlotta that Hie light and shadow were more sharply defined here than further south � that there was a curi ous blue mist in the hollows of the hills which she had not observed about Brisbane heights. Townsville wns something new. Here an affluent looking Chinese passed along the' opposite side of the street, fol lowed by a poorer brother with swinging fruit and vegetable baskets on the pole he carried athwart . his wiry shoulders. A lean blnckfcllow � proving by the crescent .of brass lie wore suspended .round his neck above his ragged coat that lie. was cither King �Billy or King Tommy � head of a district tribe, was holding in one hand a beautiful dewy bunch of mauve water lilies front some adjacent swamp, and in the other a bundle of nulla nullas, brown polished wood picked out with dull red crowned nails. A step or two behind him� as be fitted her sex � dragged liis oppressed look ing gin, carrying a dilly bag made of woven grass, and containing all their worldly goods, and a gaunt, wolfish mongrel dog stalked in the rear. A man in white, refreshingly cool to the eye, passed on a bieyclc, taking tin early morning spin on the Aitkenvalc-roud, where a mile or two out cluster thick the drooping trees and luxuriant vines of Acacia Gardens, set with' orchid blooms and tall blossoming shrubs. Beyond Hie hotel yards ran Flinders-lane� the least rcputable'portion of the city� then a wharf' und a timber yard, and the sliding Salt water Creek, deep enough for small steamers to approaeh tire wharfs for load/ ing froni Cardwell and -'further north. A trim Japanese Bcrvnnt, smiling and showing white teeth beneath his dainty black moustache, offered Curlotta a wel come cup of tea., and a Malay, clad only in shirt, and trousers, pf dazzling whiteness against, his' data' skin, brought out it hair broom and began to demolish . what he termed ''spiders.'" houses." A/tiny bush bird, -grey -feathered, with a beak, like a kingfisher's, had iloivn in under the balcony roof, und vyns making vain, at- tenipta. to. escape again, foolish as a .fright-, cned bird ever is.' . It persisted in flying high instead of swooping low and thus gain ing freedom, and ever, it heat its wings hopelessly under -what must have seemed to it an endless vista of prison. Tire Malay became very excited, and made efforts to hit the bird with his . broom, but having only- one eye he was- some whiit handicapped, and every now and then he turired to Oar- . lotto, with a smile. , - . "That bird ver� ry clever; him say not let that, mini, rat eh inc. now" then lie would make another dab at the fluttering morsel, only to miss again, -much to Carlotta's re- - lief,; for .she couid not bear to sec anything ;dcprived of its .right-. of., freedom.' Rre- 'scntly one ivild flight' elided for the. bird in .escape under the corrugated iron, arid it winged joymisly awuy .ihtb tlie mbrning blue. '�hc Malay looked after' it, scratch ing his' head. "Him not come Lack any, more; him got' sense, hiiri say 'I won't,; go there again, if I do bad man with liioom will catch mo and put me in cage; '.tlrey got sense "these aniinids� they '' think, " 'lie . said. " Carlotta . nodded'. ' She' believed they did too.' Then the MulaV , weiit -brick'to his duties below/' sa!F8..'ahdl';.!ti2..ttl#' bljndifigly upon; tlie oi'ien.eb'uiitry glcjijried .qn the .leaves of tne. mangroves by .tlie. creek." : A small toy� in holland suit arid white; sandals� was .watching Carlotta /froni the door/ of' the . little upstairs sitting' roorii.. First he' stood on , one leg nnd then upon the other, in the manner of "Zeikel" when lie went awooing, and like Zeikel. "On,; which; one lie felt the M-orse, . he couldn't have told you nuther.l" F91/ lie was ..apparently .consumed with curiosity' river the new arrivals. V "Hallo!" lie said presently/ proving jiim- Eelf- -'thereby to. ,be a 'native-' born" .Aus tralian/ "arid then' lie became very red, but :Carlotta" held out her hand. "Good morning; little boy, rind who are you?" ' "Tedward Tel-machus O'Brien� nie," he answered quickly, and anticipating the usual want .of originality in the question ings of'.'gvoy.'n ups, "F'ive last birthday!" ' "Come here!", she said, und glad to be ableto make -a closer inspection, lie was soon playing /.with her watch chain,: and 'giving her a good deal of information about' , thc tiousc and its inmates. , A- grey eat;: stealing along .the . balcony railing,: distracted his attention for ;a -i'lo. nient: ... : -.' - ' .' "How thin youi-- cat is !"' 'said Carlotta sympathetically but Tedwai'd was ""scorn- f�'; , . .->;i . "Tlrey. .do jit '.on' purpose� the cats' here," ho said., Dlieeanw they know if tlrey. "ook thin tliey will get more to eat� thos-j.: cats!" Theu he added/ tbe. gratuitotis and totally irrelevant' infohiiation, "Tommy, the coolc is never let to liaye a bath'!" ' Carlotta woiilcl have been just as com-, fortable witliout this itent . about/Tommy� who' later proved to be a long" pigtailed . Chinaman of a not unclean appeavarice. -' "Hy father is a soldier," said. Tedward; presently: "He ivent to the war arid' shoe a lot of 'meri;"fhis small form 'swelled witii pride and Carlotta was 'properly Impressed. "I have shot- a jot of 'men,' too," lie added a iriomcnt. later, 'with calm mendacity, arid abriglit faced, woman 'in 'a scarlet kimono eari-.e to the sittingroom door, 'smiled, and called nim to her. ' " . 1 The town was settling down to, its, daily work. Heavily laden omnibuses scattered clouds of dust on to the footpath, Japanese lauiidrymcn in straw hats went ' by ' with white brigs collecting the week's wasli from the various hotels and shops along the street, tired looking shop girls with, the peculiar bleached complexions of the dtvcl- lei-s in the North Queensland towns, under large green . lined umbrellas, hurried to their destinations, and a pair of well groomed horses in a smart gig tolil of the' judge, taking a turn out of his browns be fore lie went to the NortiiAYurd to' break fast, and thence to the' district court sittings. " . ' : 01fb Ward is tlic . aristocTatic part of lownsvillc. There, " along the sea front age, -grow the great cluster fig trees, ami there are the carefully tended, gardens, and the view of ttje high peaks of. Magnetic. Island; whose shores are washed ah day by Hie blue of 'tliq Pacific tides.. Here 'the large '.liotti,.. b" red brick, '. faces the water, thp long breakivnter and the jetty/ and shipping, the signal station, and the fort. _ Further on along, tile Straiid are graceful coeoauut palms and smooth grassed plcnsances about trim -weatherboard, cot tages, and towering cliffs, with soft green things growing in tlie crevices of the rock, and rope-like creepers swinging from the heights. Stay in North IVnrd in the winter, and, except for a surplus of dust cast ii> by passing bus and buggy, call Towmu-ilte beaulitiil. For tlie shade is deep, ami eool under thick green leaf and shielding bough, nnil thu air is balmy, soft ami scented, and ever tinged with the fresh saltiness of the breeze which blows in at high tide from Cleveland Bay. And when the wliitc- stulod yuclits are out on' a clear afternoon, dipping and dancing motlilikc 011 the lift ing waves, and when, the curling crests cioam along tire sandy shores, and the old coal hulks lie black mid still nn by the quarantine station, and the little steamer ploughs -a-ehojipy .sea returning from Picnic Bay, ,and tlic.Vessels from overseas rear black and-red and wljte funnels above the 

 western break water, you may sit an hour or more under the deep shadows- of- the many-rooted fig trees, or down on a half submerged log among the brown, shell strewn sunds, and if you nre one of the native horn you will cnll the land that owns you fair, and wonder, perhaps,, in your drifting Australian fashion, whether the little brown nnd yellow men from larids be yond, who linve already sent their cmis- snrien before them, do not ulao look uuon your country with a covetous eye, und long to stretch forth a wary, slow, out-reaching hand Hint, onee closed, has a grip which it is hard to shake off. During the next few days Carlotta had a good deiil of Tedward's company. He uniiisetl her with his quaint remarks, which lie always prefaced with, "I say! Do you know " and then proceeded to give her information more or less authen tic. lie hugged an overpowering wish to become the driver of a steam roller, and was sure Uarlotta must be imbued with the same soaring ambition. He used to stand against the iron railing of tlie bal cony, looking out at the heavy passing of the engine, divided between an old desire to be the driver, nnd a newer fancy towards the position of the man who walked in front, carrying a red flag, nnd scattering the small boys and the straying goats. One night after dinner, when the dusk wus on the hills, und the stars were begin ning to come out one by one, lie begged persistently for Curlotta to "sing -him a song," which she eventually discovered meant to tell him a story, and, racking her brains, she gradually built up the following, which,, she thought, contained a. much need ed moral lesson: � "Once there wus a little boy " : "Bigger nor.' me?" from Tedward, who had curled himself comfortably into the hollow of her arm, as they sat togotlicrih a long easy chuir. ' ' "About the same size as you, 'Ped,- and he was always, leaning over baleoriies and frightening his mother into fits, for slic was afraid lie would overbalance' himself .arid trill into the stteet below, and be smashed into Such sinull pieces. Hint she would never be able, to . find .him again. He used to prom-, ise liis mother-' that lie -would not climb- up, but lie was always forgetting, and one night, when he was oil the balcony by him self, lie actually did lean over so fur that lie fell� fell head over heels down , through the air, and saw the ground coming up. to hit him.-. Now, up in the sky, every star that you. see hanging its white lauui out in the blue, .is a house where a fairy lives. Some are pink fairies, and they ure. the kindest of all, and some are yellow fairies, and they are rather eross, betause. they can't help seeing everything with a jaun diced eye, and some arc blue fairies, .and they nrol.niccj but do not bother ...iriucji,. nnd some. are purple fairies, who sit. all. flay knitting the storm clouds; and some .are white fairies, "who crochet the little fleecy wiiito coulds you sec on a fine day. On this night the only fairy who happened to be looking out of her front door was a pink fairy, and through the clear air she saw the little boy falling down head over heels, like a fly frorii the balcony, and she took one big jump� for fairies never stop to think� and she caught the little boy just as lie was going to be smashed to bits on the as phalt." ' Tedward : looked somewhat disappointed. "Didn't he 'get smashed at all?"-. he in quired anxiously. ' : "Not at all !' For thc fairy carried/him right through the air up to her star, and her star- was a beautiful little silver house with three corners, and' on each 'corner hung a little golden lamp that burned only scented oil, squeezed from fairy flowers." "Why did she not put him: back on, the bnleony?" asked practical Ted. , , '.'Because she was afraid there might be grown up people. -/riboiit, and grown up people are so silly� they never know. fairies W.lieri tliey see them, .but always, .caJL-tlie, . cat.-ior.-'seridnfor ttlie policeman, or- throw- things, so the: pink, fairy thought it would: be ihest to take the little v boy with her until the day lime. The floor of her house was made of silver, and it had lovely red. andgrcen and purple stones 'set in it, and a gold door ltnob, and' the fairy took the little boy through the open . door and showed him a beautiful hall. The ceiling was made of plum cake, with white icing in between, and the walls were made of ice cream and lollies; arid beyond the hall wae a lovely little bedroom,- all hung- with white-, satin, with the loveliest bed in it' tlmt you could imagine.. The pillows were so soft .that when you got into the bed your head sank so deep -into them that only your nose stuck up; and in a sweet little diningroom was laid the nicest supper a. little boy could have." "Not a plain bun?" asked Tedward, with pathetic - recollections of what his mother apparently thought good for him. �1'',9|b' noJ Everything nice and indi- gcsttblo! Lemonade to drink and jam tarts to eat, and. things like- that, and when he |iad eaten as much as lie possibly could the fairy popped him- into a real silver. ; path, where the soap was made into the Ahime of ships that just sailed overi you and , washed;, you that- way." could he stay in -as. long as he hked, and splash the floor?" - ' :�- course he could. This was a lanys. house. "YYliat happened next?" "Oh' He slept all night, arid in the morning the fairy .took him' back to his mother, dropped him.on the balcony, where lus poor mother had been watching all night, but first she made him promise� the fiury I mean-that he would never lean over balcony railings 'again, " finished Car lotta, lamely; her imagination having given out suddenly: ,. wbdcr,"' speculated Tcd\\vard, lbok- ring as though lie contemplated muking the attempt, "! Svonder if -I fell over too fur/if the -fairy- would fly down'for'me?" "I- rim surc' she would not!!' said Car lotta hastily, fearing that her story had (lone more hartn than good. But Teddy looked -somewhat unconvinced 'as lie lug- giugly responded to his mother's cnll that it was bedtime. '.'1 really don't 'think 1 was ever intended to train the young idea," Carlotta laughed to herself wlicn tlie small holland coated figure had disappeared through' the doorway, and she mused on the apparent impression left by her story, so diflerent to what she intended to con voy. "It reminds mo of the time 1 essay ed to take a class in' Suridaj' school' ,!and was discovered by the horrified parson to be reauiiig translations of French fairy tales to the children- to keep tliein quiet- I do not think lie would have minded 'so muclrif tlie stories had not been from tlie French;- he vaguely associated it- with im moral works!" The . following .afternoon Carlidtta climb- eil adventurously on to Hie box. seat of a bus,- arid '.took a dusty ride out to the im-' fashionable end of the town, where Human Nature stalks unadorned. Amongst u wil-' durness. of grimy wooden cottages," with their cluster of dirty-faced, weak-eyed' children, were ninny snug little 'tradesmen's cots, surrounded with green hedges and tlie. inevitable mango tree, glossy green of foliage, tipped with warm madder brown where tlio nqw leaves sprung amongst the matured green. It was not the liiango .fruit season at present, so there were" 110 heavy emerald or golden fruits hanging among the leaves. Presently the bus' swung' out of the straight road with its choking dust clouds into an uneven track, which kept the slopes of Castle Hill on' the right, wuile 011 the left showed the far away peaks of the western hills.' On this side Castle Hill showed not so much rock as smooth, grassy undulations, covered witli small green stunted trees. The driver pulled up liis horses for a moment to let a lady, who was apparently paying calls, de scend. She asked him to "Wait 'ere a bit till 1 see if my lydy friend is at 'ome; and if she is at 'ome I won't come back, and if she ain't I will� see?" The driver saw, and sulkily agreed to wait a moment while, she made inquiries.' Presently a bellow from the verandah of the house of call gave him the welcome in- formatiea visa? Hie lady friend -was -'"at 

 -'ome," and the, horses trotted smartly off. By the rondsidc walked a sodden faced, heavily built, white, woman, accompanied 1 by a half-caste child and a kanaka hus band, who was wheeling another child in a little hand cart, a pretty little thing with the fair hair of her European parentage, and deep dark kanaka eyes. They made a curiously significant quartet as they moved silently along. The bus wheeled round by a large red brick hotel, and drew up to change horses. An individual in blue dungaree, trousers, flannel shirt, u felt hat and a hopeless ex pression, with a cigarette between his teeth, came out to help with the horses. 'II is breath was a shrieking advertisement for the local brewery, and his lack lustre eyes and shaking hand proclaimed but slow recovery from a colossal drinking bout. Be hind him towered the hill, and lower, a mass of greenery, a trellis over which clambered a rose colored riot of flowering vine, and between hill and tree, a little open space where coarse bladcd grasses bent in the wind and the ground was car peted with the poisonous little magenta and white blossoms of the vinen, which Carlotta had first noted .as she caine from the boat on the day of her arrival. As they repassed the hotel on their return journey, a patched looking man with a canvas bag, hailed to the driver, adding, "Give us a lift, Mister, and I'll pay you to-morrow." The bus driver smilingly� nnd it seemed to Carlotta somewhat trustingly � agreed, and the patched' man climbed in beside her and smoked silently, since, let a man be never so poverty stricken iii' appearance, lie always seems to have the wherewithal with which to procure a pipeful, and as a rule (at any rate in Townsville) the luxury of a "long beer." Back they went past the tidy little villas, and the untidy, little wooden cot tages, past dusty, cyclists returning from shop and office, as the sun hid behind the hills, -past the groups, of .children, some wizen faced, bearing already the mark of care, . past others careless ainl happy as children should be.. Here, a Chinaman jolting out behind bis -old -white horse in his eiripty vegetable cart,' there the beery rubicund countenance .of. a. cabman going homo- to his tea and -liis "old woman," but for the most part/'thfe pedestrians were sweat-marked/ wharf laborers or. city loafers with the "happy go lucky" -Australian dawdle, or an occasional sturdy dame, bear ing brown paper parcels, who had been shopping in Flinders-street, and wus saving a bus fare home, because "tlie kiddies want so much now they're growing"; the true philosophic self-sacrificing- spirit of mother hood; the world over.' 'For if it is rare for the Australian workman to deny himself pipe or beer, self-denial is the rule v v i P 1 1 his ' Lard' : working, ' seldom-resting, better" half. . ../ . Novelists do not go into the little two- roomed cottage where , the mother of many is . hanging over the wash tub,, fighting fatigue iu herself and sandy blight in ncr children, when they want a heroine, though one true sighted Queensland poet has sung feelingly of the "Women of the West."-,.'SysialIy handicapped,: ill edu- eatcdfIll iMfctibcd, unattractive after the bcuuto dc /Vtblc (so quickly passing iu Queensland) Lus gone, and yet with a grop ing after tlie Divine, which her husband seldom, and she never realises in herself, she toils from dawn to dark� and after, doing her best for "himself and the kills" she had to "try to keep her man from the pubs," ' get her children their share of schooling at the State school, to cook, to wash, to scrub, not only for her own fam ily, but when her man's earnings go into the pocket of the fat publican (who drives a b.uggy and wears a gold watch chain ail the week and sends his. boys to the gram mar- school) . slic- has ito ckc out the bread and butter money : by -"taking in work" or : going, out to-ehaiMo 'Shc. is a . marvel, this frequently plain;'- stooping shouldered little1 woman with the palicnco'of a female Job and the heart of ii lion. And the key to it all is � Motherhood. Exceptions there are of course, unfortunately there always are exceptions to every good thing, but tiicy are not the rule. Carlotta was not an especially motherly, woman. She shuddered if 'she heard of cruelties to- children; she could be fond of bright, unusual children, but she did not feel that her life ivas empty ..without them.. She was (had circumstances been more- favorable) essentially a, wife-woman. Though a strong sense of justice � which means ' duty in such a relationship� would have made' her do- her best for her child had he lived. She would have loved him as a person, not blindly alone because he was her child. The -companionship, tlie love of a husband/ should have been the crowning joy of her life, and instead of that, as.sho neared the hotel and descended; from the bus, rather congratulating her-, self on the way in which she accomplished that feat, Ben was waiting sulkily -in the .hotel hall, -ready to blame her unreservedly for such' an unconventional action as riding alone,. on the. front of an omnibus. . . "You: ..will- be getting yourself talked' about all over the town," lie said angrily. "Why do you tear about by yourself" like this V" Carlotta might have made the retort ob vious that . she went alone because he never, offered to come with her, . but in-" stead she held herself in check, looked over the banisters at him as she went upstairs, blew him a kiss from her finger tips, and, for the benefit of a listening house maid,- was "Sorry he had beea so anxious." "Anxious!" growled Ben, still ruffled, as he wont into the bar. . ; And Carlotta,. as soon as she reached her room-.-, practically -took down her; hair and" began to brush the dust out of it. : "Is it my duty not to go out for bus rides ncspecially not to sit on the box?" she asked whimsically of -her reflection in- the mirror. "Should I take cabs, and send tlie' bill to Ben ?" she laugh ted suddenly, called herself a spiteful cat, and proceeded to put- Ben's dinner jacket ready for him. I . .must let - off. steam soriieho'w," she ' added presently, coiling her hair low on her white neck, and sticking a jewelled pin through it. . "If I did not I should explode � certainly . blow up some fine day, and Ben . would ascend on the explosion!" And. then Ben entered and asked her why she was - making , a guy of herself "with that skewov in her hair. -Ben was particularly ungracious -nowa days. , . .. / CHAPTER VH. Of all' the cruelties of cruel nature, surely that of compulsory motherhood is the 'worst/ Tlio motherhood of Harry Sing Moiv's- mother had been of stieli. ; The daughter of a drunken bullock driver, who lmd, when she was but sixteen yours, -sold her to a- wealthy Chinese storekeeper in the little mountainous tin mining torin where she was born � slio had conceived and borne her son in hatred, and had died of that hate when they placed - the little yellow, apelike: creature in her urms. Sing Mow, sen.,' had fretted grievously over - liis girl wife's loss, rind the bullock driver had cursud the dead woman for a fool who co'uld not see that a rich Chinese Was bet ter than a poor white, for he had hoped to have many pickings from his son-in-law. The fruit of hate is evil, and Hurry Sing Mow was evil, evil with tlie cunning of the yellow nnd the idleness of the low white. Ah Sing Mow had meant to make a doc tor of his son, but Harry would not work, und was. plucked in liis preliminary cxam., - and he would not try again, for he haled the arrogant white as intensely as his mother lmd hated the cringing Yellow, and pre-natal influence reversed, was strong within him. He quarrelled with his father and drifted north, antl became a prey on the credulity of the superstitious "White, pretending preternatural gifts of healing. As a medical clairvoyant he. came to have quite a reputation, for he had some little skill, acquired while he was studying medi cine, for which he had some natural lean- 

 ings, though want of application had been his' stumbling block in his school days. Ho lodged over a Chinaman's shop in a street in Townsville, between the railway station and the post office � a low veran- duhed place, with a rabbit warren of little rooms ut the back, where there were-- strango happenings in the short, hot, sweat sodden nights. A window faced the street, and in it were displayed green china fish of tortured expression, dainty afternoon tea cups, rice bowls and pule blue and red chop sticks, glass bungles, Chinese lanterns und the fly specked ivory model of a joss house. Be hind the window all the day through sat .Ah Sin, the fat Chinaman, with snavca front aud pigtail hanging, doing liis com mercial eorresjiondenee by painting innu merable letters intu innumerable littla books with the sharp downward strokes of a camel's hair brush. Occasionally lie paused to fan himself with a palm leaf tail, and to cast an oblique glance out into the buking street� for surely one of tlie hottest places in Australia is Fiiuders- strect, Townsville. Even admirers of the strange, interesting, dirty city say, "Keep out of Flinders-street in midsummer," and commercial travellers of ruddy, well fed appearance will inform the casual visitor in fueling terms that it is us much as liis life is worth to venture down there on a December day. / There were other Chinamen passing like shadows in and out of thu dusky back ground of the little shop, through the rat tling green and red bead curtain winch glittered there� Chinamen of lack-lustre eye and feeble gait, bearing with them a strange cloying odor, which, to the initi ated, meant opium, for there were chests of. tea in one of -the buck rooms at Ah Sin's which hid more than teu, and the police kept a watchful eye, but AU Bin lutd not been caught red liuudcd� yet. His excuse for having so many clients was the medical, clairvoyant upstairs. Harry bing Alow was not often seen in tlio shop. He had a little lattice work bal cony, which overlooked a wilderness of back yards, and the smooth readies of Ross Greek, where ut high tide the shadows ot the bushy muugrovu - trees were darkly re flected, and where even the far oil' crests of the blue hills tvere mirrored ut the rosy dawning. Harry Sing Alow wns pas sionately fond of beauty; he dabbled a little in -water colors, und had some clever sketches of the river and the hills with the water reflections well worked out. He hud been known to make an eager patient 'wait in the' stuffy room where the big screens shut out what little air was going, while he admired a sunset from the privacy of his balcony. He was a slightly built man,, with full red lips aud slunting eyes and a- yellow skin, with a black wave in his liair, which he took from his dead mother, and beautiful hands � the nails ot which .he polished . daily, He also played tlie - violin daintily, and had once sung in a church choir, but the strength of the "white Australia" feeling amongst the other boys had been too much for mm, and hut tor the fact that his fury made iuiu so blind lor the instant, that liis knife missed the' stroke lie intended to give, bing Alow might have seen a penitentiary or trie gal lows lor the murder of a parson's son. For it man of fierce Oriental passions was Harry Sing -Mow. He desired witliout love, lie 'took witliout tenderness, and east oil, when lie was -tired, without compunction. He loved flowers and birds, thougn he hud once starved a guy-winged purrokcet to death because, it had bitten his forefinger deep to the'bonc. lie had watched it droop and die, day after, day, with malicious iilea- sure. He Itad held a handful of bird seed and green stuff near the edge to tantalise it; lie. lutd shuken cool water up and down in a tin just outside tlic bars. He had -tho roughly enjoyed himself, 'and had only been sorry that ..it died so soon, and thus shortened his pleasure. A limn of many parts was the bullock driver's grandson. The handsome half-caste girl from a near plantation, who had listened to Harry and given up her -home Ivith the kind white lady who was- educating ' her and treating her like a daughter, meaning to take her home to England: the following year,, proud of her protege, who had good blood in her : veins, had fled back a year later to die at .her mistress's door � moaning of human devils� distraught, a ghastly wreck of what liitd onee been fine, shapely woman- 

 hood. They bad buried her on. the station fi' i! ami the "Boss" had gone to look foe i j Harry. But when he lound him he had j suddenly become all Chinaman, and "no -i ,'j savee" was all the' Boss coula get from ri him. ' j The Boss looked doubtfully at the green - I hide whip lie carried, and thoughtfully at; ' Harry's slcudcr shoulders, then decided to j M give it best, us tlic girl hud said her lovec j ma a gentleman and nearly white,' and it -j must he that the man's name was but a , figment of her delirium. This man was i surely all Cliiuky. There must be some i :! mistake. Ko the Ross rode hack to the - plantation to tell his wife the girl had ' lied, and Harry went oat on to the bal- ' v cony to finish a delicate little painting of . a river steamer lying along the whurf iu the grey dusk, with a flare of bush fires j J (laming uluug behind the hills nnd crown- i ' ing the crusts with a jewelled tiara. It was ! one of the most successful things he ever ' did. ' . : Ben Davis grew to know Ah Sin's show well in the stillness of the autumn even ings, when the breeze died down, and tho sea between Alagnetic Isliind and the Strand was like sheeted glass. Sing Mow ' exercised an influence over the consump- < , live which wus not all the outcome of faith in the former's healing powers. There was something curiously fascinating to Ben in being able to sit out on the little balcony -while the limn of the city caine up from the dark, amongst the l'ninglcd odors of opium smoke and tlie heavy scents of flowers which stood in a tall vase at Harry's elbow. For Harry was tho polished gentleman� or his idea of it � when Davis came to call. He talked o� art and music, and sometimes lie brought ' oat his violm, and sweet strains floated above the frowsy backyards and down to thy shark-infested river. Then Harry would drop his violin into its 1 mother o' pearl ornamented ease, and tak ing Ben's wrist lightly in his grasp would ,- send a delightful thrill of drowsiness ,- through his veins. When in the closj ' inoist evenings his breathing was more dif- V fieultt than usual, Ben seemed to derive ' especial benefit from Sing Afow's touch i-hough when lie finally dragged his unwill- i; mg feet back to the hotel, where Carlollit sat alone and feared - and wondered, the momentary exaltation and relief had gone and he was almost too exhausted to spciilc ere ho fell into a heavy slumber, broken by uneasy dreams. He never told liis wife Xi- where he had been, hut she guessed that; he was with some quack whom he fancied ' /f- rolicved him for the time. She knew, o� j| course, that he , had come north for some - jj : special' purpose,' since no doctor, to her :j!" knowledge, had recommended it. She had j| fallen into the way of asking no questions. -ii since -she. feared evasive answers. Ben had grown strangely uncommunicative of late. 1 ;! . Once she had laughingly asked, "What is that funny Chinainamiy smell about your coats now; I notice it when I brush '/: them. I hope you are not becoming art i opium fiend, Ben?" But the sudden shadow on his faco had checked the laugh upon her lips, and she | had not attempted to joke on the subject again. Life was becoming hard enough for ;V" her nowadays. There were recollections /; that hurt and a feeling of emptiness in her ,/ daily life for which . she could not� or would not try to� account.
