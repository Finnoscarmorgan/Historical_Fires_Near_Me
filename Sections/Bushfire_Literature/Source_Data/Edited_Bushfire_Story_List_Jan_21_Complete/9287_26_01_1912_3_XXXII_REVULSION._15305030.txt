 CHAPTER XXXII. 

 REVULSION. 

 "If they do get inn dash em, " he said to himself, with scorn; "and she invites Mrs. Knight to tea with her I'll divorce Emily before she sets foot in her house!" And,   feeling better for the resolution he plunged again into the thick of the fight. He ex- horted coaxed cheered on Routh's faltering   supporters But it was with a heart that sank more and more as the minutes went on. 

 Routh sat in the committee room close by the George Hotel. He sat with a smile that tried to hide any feeling. But it was the grimmest of smiles. He was tired out with the strain of the battle. Tired out, and sick at heart. The election would be lost ; it was virtually lost already. He only wanted to have it over, get done with it. He had had enough. Knight, darting in and out, brought him news of the world outside. Routh had 

 just come in from a dispiriting round of the polling stations. Everywhere had been that constraint that palpable effort to avoid him, that lack of any welcome. When a cheer went up it was so feeble that he wished to Heaven they would keep dumb. There   was not a chance for him since those dogged group that hung about the corners and swarmed the market place refused to be   

 driven by any persuasion to the poll. Knight came in again, hot and disordered. He took off his hat, and wiped his streaming brow. " Oh a bit crusty still!" he said, trying to speak lightly in answer to Routh's   

 dry questions. "Want a bit more trying-- 

 I'll be at them again in a minute.   

 But he lingered. Routh sympathised with his hesitation. Who wanted to begin again such a sickening unwelcome task? Better throw   the sponge up, and take their beating smiling. It was all that was left. From the market place outside there came a sudden lull in the roar of voices, of tramping feet, of braying motor horns. It had the effect of a silence of portent. Routh raised his head, and looked over his shoulder at the window.   

 "Hello, what's up?" Knight darted to   the side of the room that gave the clearest 

 view of the market place.   

 Somebody's addressing them. Somebody in a carriage. It isn't any of our side. Why,   how they're stopping to hear! It must be   some good speaker. He's on the seat of the   

 carriage--standing. No; i'ts a woman! Lor' bless me !" 

 "Mrs Slack." Routh still sat with his elbows 

 on the table. He did not look round   again.     

 "Mrs. Slack," disgustedly, "no more Mrs. Slack than it's me. It's somebody I never     set eyes on--a swell by the looks of her. Well, I never. They can't hear her well   enough, and they're shouting: 'Into the   George; speak from there.' " I never saw a crowd so taken. It beats me. There she's   got out of the carriage and the police are keeping the way for her. She's gone into   the George. She'll speak from the balcony.   We can hear her in there. Yes; there she   comes. Why she s quite young and thun-   dering pretty. Where has Slack unearthed her from? For from the interest of the crowd in the market place their encourage- ment, their eagerness, Knight leapt to the   

 instant conclusion that this was a new   

 opponent of theirs. 

 "Electors of Bromwell," it was a girl's voice   --clear, ringing, musical carried far across the surging crowd. There fell an instant silence. Even those unruly members of the mob that rioted on its outskirts were hushed harshly by the more decent. In the hush the voice sounded like a trumpet--so firm, so raised, so silvery. Routh sitting with 

 his back turned, heard it through his as-   

 sumed indifference. He started, got up sud-   

 denly, came over to the window after Knight, and stood there behind his shoulder. From where they stood they had a full view of the George balcony, used a hundred times for the same purpose. From the long window of the upstairs room used for public dinners there had stepped out a slight swaying figure. It came straight to the front of the balcony, 

 leaned over the railing held out both hands. The sea of upturned faces below had stiffened suddenly into quiet with the new interest.   Something that had been cried to them from the carriage had fired their attention. They were eager to listen. Knight almost danced in his excitement The man who stood by him was without movement. 

 A charming flushed face--a gesture of   appeal. Then the call "Electors of Bromwell." 

 The voice rang out to the furthest edge of the crowd. Knight heard a stifled exclamation from behind him but he was too intent on   listening. He gave it no attention. 

 Let me speak to you. Listen. I only want to say such a few words. There has been set about a falsehood about Mr. Routh,   and some of you have believed it. I want to tell you it is a lie-a cruel lie. There is not one word of truth in the whole of it. He could never have done the thing he is accused of. He is not capable of it. He cannot clear himself, so I have come to clear him. You can believe him when he tells you he never did so dishonourable a thing."   She paused--and amazement held the crowd for an instant, frozen. Then a voice cried from the edge of the mob. 

 "Well and good, Miss. But how do you   know better than them as says he's a     

 blaguard?" 

 For just half a second she shrank. Then she lifted her head and gave the answer back boldly, courageously. 

 I know because I am the woman the story is about. I am the girl in Scotland. I was engaged to him. There was never any Political secret--never-- never. He never threw me over. It was I myself broke the engagement for quite other reasons. In justice to him I stand here to tell you so. Go and vote for him, if this lie keeps you back from voting. Its a wicked untruth." 

 And with that such a frenzy of cries and cheers broke out as drowned her last utter- ance. Hats waved in the air; sticks were   

 thrown heavenwards, and caught as they       

 fell on dodging heads. From the multitude, close packed there came bellows of relief, admiration, exultation. With the shouts   that thundered mixed the frantic yells of   

 "Routh for ever," to which the town had     grown unaccustomed in those last few hours.     and "Chair her! Chair her! rose in gusts of         shouting from the delighted intoxicated mob.     But Jean, waving one protesting hand to them, turned and fled into the room behind   

 her, and the window shut hurriedly   

 down. 

 For another instant Knight watched the surging crowd roll and roar together. Then, disentangling itself, streams set out for the nearest polls. His face turned purple. "By the powers; she's done it," he gasped hoarse- ly, "the tide's turned." He rushed from the place headlong. The door stood open be- hind him, and the room stood empty. The Government candidate had gone before him, but not to the triumph. He had taken the short cut into the George Hotel through the 

 stables, with a flying foot.   

 Jean, panting, glowing, half-hysterical, had   

 sunk on a sofa so far from the window that she was invisible from the street outside. She had made her supreme cast. It had succeeded. But the inevitable reaction followed. She did not know whether exultation or shame were   

 the weightiest feeling under which she stag-   

 gered. And then the door burst open, burst open without a knock. She turned swiftly, and saw who came in and shut it behind him. She got up from her chair in a panic, and she stood face to face with Routh.   

 "Jean." He had both his hands out im-   

 petuously. He had caught her in them be-   

 fore she could resist--if she had meant to "Jean-and you did it for me. For me-- after everything, Jean. O my Jean.'" For 

 just an instant she stood so. Then her   

 look changed. She drew her hands from   his, drew them gently, quietly. With a face   

 that was pale again she faced him. His own face grew faintly white.   

 "You--it is because you are grateful. There   

 is no need. I could not let you be ruined when I could speak. It is nothing, nothing --you must not think you have to thank   

 me," she was trembling suddenly.   

 "Thank you! On my knees. Jean! Not   

 because you have turned the tide for me, won the day, perhaps. But because you did it for my sake---because, oh, Jean, I must take hope, I must believe it! You care a little still, my darling! If you 

 didn't, you wouldn't have done this for me. I won't be driven from you, no, by heaven, I won't!" With that she was in the arms 

 that hungered for her, and he strained her   

 to his eager heart. 

 "I thought you had forgotten. Till--till I heard you speak last night. If I had be- lieved you cared really I could never have refused you, when you wrote that letter long ago."   

 And, bending his head to the soft hair at his   

 shoulder, he said, very low; "It is I who ought to have been forgotten--cast away. But,   

 Jean, I loved you always, always--even when I was most a villain and a fool. Let me begin all over again--let me try to show you, dear, how I adore you. Take me back, and love me as you used to do."   

 Routh's electors romped to the polls, as   

 Slack's had been doing. They turned a dis- graceful defeat into a splendid victory. Knight   came in hour after hour, brought news more and more cheering, more and more exultant. In the end he was all one crow. Routh was returned for Bromwell by an excellent ma- jority. That speech of Jean's had turned the ebbing tide, and sent it flowing back again. It was a woman-won election if there ever was one. Knight told his wife. 

 When the polls were declared, the newly elected member for Bromwell came out on to the balcony of the George with the electric lights flaring on him, and made a grateful speech from his heart. To the continued yells of "'The lady!--bring out the lady!" he re- sponded in the end by stepping back, and handing out Jean, all smiles and blushes, the more so when the voice of acclamation ended by proclaiming her "the M.P.'s missus!" 

 There was time for a wedding before the     general election, which followed hard on this by what people called Routh's hard luck. But this time there was almost a walk-over. Slack declined to contest, and the man who took his place had not a chance against the popularity 

 of Routh and his wife. 

 Routh is an able man in the House, sound   and even brilliant, when occasion requires. 

 He still writes, and his name is becoming a widely-known one. They say he has good   things still ahead of him for the taking. But 

 the thing that fills his heart now is not so much success and a career, but the happiness of that home Jean makes for him and her and their children. He has learnt that there are better things in life than ever the shouts of   

 the multitude, the fame of the vulgar crowds.   

 He knows that no price will buy the love of   

 a true and faithful woman--the home she can make for him, and the life she can share with him there. He has ceased to count fortune 

 or fame as the highest and best gifts of life. 

 He works hard, and he loves his work still. Jean helps him in it. Neither of them were born for idleness. But when he comes back from the House, and lets himself into the home where something awaits him that he ranked lower than his career in the past-- when he sees two little heads on their pil-   lows in the dim light of the nursery, and stands over them with a woman's shoulder by his shoulder--his heart is warm. Jean looks and looks with him, presses the arm that steals about her.   

 Together they go down to their own talk by the fire--that precious night talk before they sleep. She listens to the story of struggles   and the disappointments and the triumphs of his day-sympathises with all of them-- encourages, helps, comforts. He is refreshed for tomorrow's work. 

 And again and again when he falls asleep in his contentment, he says to himself with his last waking breath, "Thank heaven I got her before the end came. Thank God for the wife that is the best and sweetest wife in the world, my Jean of all Jeans on earth. Thank God for all that went first, and taught me to value her. But for that I should have ended a selfish heartless cur." 

 And Jean, perhaps, says her own quiet thanksgiving before she, too, goes to slumber. But a woman's prayers are less loud than those of men. 

 THE END.   

   

 A number of bush fires broke out yesterday and gave the various stations of the N.S.W. fire brigades a     busy time in extinguishing them and saving property   generally. The fires occurred in all parts of the suburbs, Ashfield, Burwood, Drummoyne, Long Bay,   Willoughby, and Abbotsford suffering from out-     

 breaks. The fire in Burwood occurred in Willie 

 street, on the property of Sydney Thompson and swept a large area of land, destroying several panels of   

 fencing and an outhouse on the property. The neigh-   

 bouring property, occupied by Mr. J. R. Docker, also 

 suffered to the extent of several panels of fence.   

 A meeting of the Mosman Christmas Carol Carnival     Committee was held on Wednesday. The secretary (Mr Miles Ariel) stated that the net proceeds--nearh �35-- had been handed to Mr. Dorman, of the Hospital Satur- day fund.
