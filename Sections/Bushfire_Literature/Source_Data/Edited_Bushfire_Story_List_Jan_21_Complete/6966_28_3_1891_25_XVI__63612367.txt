Illie Story of a Royal Pendulum.

 I CHAPTER XVI. 

 -(CONTINUED.) 

 Of course hands were shaken, on it, and of course Bob shook hands with the baby. He would have done all sorts of things, I think, judging by his frolicsome manner, had not Rhoda, who was utterly be- wildered at the offer, and none the less so at its acceptance in such complete confidence, demurely asked, * But whore is the money to come from ? ' 

 Bob looked guilty, and hesitated. 

 But Dale said : ' You must tell her now.' While Lucy laughed merrily. 

 �Tell me what ? ' asked Rhoda. 

 ' You tell her, Lucy,' said his lordship. And so Lucy had her wish. 

 Poor Lord Kobert watched Rhoda's face anxiously, half fearing, I really think, that he might get his dismissal ; at any rate I could see he looked for some dis- 

 pleasure on her part. He interjected words now and then, very boyishly, and very nervously given. 

 When all was known to her, Rhoda, to his evident great relief, simply turned to him and said : ' I don't much mind, because Hook you as a poor man, and because you won't want to lead a fashionable life. I will try to he a good wife to you in your position, but I must live near them.' 

 ' Come to England first for a bit,' said Bob. 'Very well,' quietly replied Rhoda, * and I want now to see Mr. Bolt.' 

 Poor Rhoda, she was dazed ; the excite- ment of the fire, the sort of shock with whick she became engaged, the keen sorrow for her people, her trouble at Bolt's accident, had rendered her almost solemn in the last scene. 

 Bob took her to Bolt's tent, and at her 

 wish left her there. 

 What may have passed during that inter- view I cannot tell, but I fancy from the complete confidence in manner towards each other in the future, that by some means Rhoda had let him know she under- stood him. 

 All this love-making business, and general joy arrangements for the future, were very nice and pleasant, but I began to wonder why somebody didn't think of practical work. And I was personally 

 interested, and considered my position as follows:-It doesn't do for old Royal Pendulums to run the risk of a soaking, or of dampness leading to rust. It was becoming most serious. Fancy my star wheel getting rusty, and my losing with the minute hand j or my third wheel pinion having a spot of the hated brown stuff on it, and hindering my striking. I longed to have my lifting piece in order once again, which � warns' with that old-fashioned buzz, before I strike. I would have * warned ' louder than I over did before. 

 There's nothing like old clock heads on old clock cases, either in Royal Pendulums or men, and hardly had I finished my grizzle when Dyke came vip to Dale. 

 * Mister,' he said, ' this aint no place for women. Let me haye 'em-and 4 the baby. Put 'em in the dray and I'll send 'em home-slow and safe. Mr. Bolt fust though-I stop along of 'im-Digbeth 'ull take us in-good man-good woman they'll nurse 'im.' 

 Digbeth, it will be remembered, was the selector who had aided them in their attack upon the bush fire-a Warwickshire man with a Gloucestershire wife-and she still cast wistful yearnings back to the Cotswolds, where she had spent her maiden days. No particle of old country home feeling had left them, and to make room for our, and their friend, Bolt, seemed to them an advent of joy. It was sc arranged., Bolt was carried to Digbeth't on his mattrass, which was laid upon � bush-made stretcher, Dale, Lord Robert and the men on the place bearing him The welcome they received, Double-cas� told me, was delightful-cheery faces o: clean women are so very charming, and says Double-case, what took me back to ol< England was the Gloucestershire accen of Mrs. Digbeth.
