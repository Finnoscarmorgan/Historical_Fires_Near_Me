 Chapter III. 

 BY ONYX. 

 "IT is getting too late for you, Minnie," Mrs. Powis said, bustling up to the side of the couch. "It is such a lovely evening," replied Mrs. 

 Verner, a little absently. " Yes, but cold. Come in at once;" and without more ado she took the coverlet from off the invalid's feet, and the pillow from under her head; and Mrs. Verner, knowing that resistance was useless, meekly followed her. "Ronald is late this evening," she said to her husband as she passed; "he was to have taken Ismene for a ride." Mr. Powis did not reply, and Mrs. Powis trotted away with her load and disappeared at the French window. Just as she went in a quick step and a merry laugh resounded from the terrace on the other side of the house. Ismene must have been listening for it, for at the first sound she was on the verandah, and had just reached the corner at which her father was standing when a tall young man came up. " You looked the wrong way to-night, Ismene," was the laughing salutation, as he grasped her hand. "How do you know I looked at all?" she re torted, with a saucy little " move." "I hope you did, dear, at all events," he said in a lowor voice, squeezing tighter the hand that still lay in his. The answer convoyed in the expression of the face that was upturned to his was satisfac factory, apparently, for his face beamed joyously as ho shook hands with Mr. Powis. " It is not too late for a ride, is it, sir?" he said, as Ismene told him that she had been expecting him for the last hour. " I could not come before; Mr. Gurney kept me." "Yes, I think it's too late now," said the father reluctantly; "it will be dark almost immediately." " Very well, papa, we'll give it up; only you will have to take mo another day instead, Ronald; mind that." Ronald looked as if ho was quite willing to " mind," and Ismeno led him oft to look at her roses. "I have three such lovely ones in bloom," she said as they went off to the garden, just as well pleased as though they had had their ride�in that happy state of mind when what ever is is host. Pity it comes so rarely, and lasts so short a space of time ! Mr. Powis watched them as they sauntered along�he with his arm through hers, in defiance of afl rules and regulations, and bending down his well-shaped head the better to hear what she was saying, or to be closer to the face that then he thought the fairest in the world. Fair she certainly was ; as white and stainless as a lily, with wavy silken hair�rather dark for so fair a akin�and dark, very dark, blue eyes. Ismenc Powis was allowed, even by her young 'lady friends, to be the beauty of Warroo �and, Ronald fondly thought, not of Warroo only, but of the whole country round. Mr. Powis's face assumed a very contented expression as he watched. If life had not been very smooth for him it bid fair to be smooth for her. In every respect�except that very im portant one of means�Ronald Ormond was a desirable match for his child; and now that drawback would be removed. Ormond was only a " super" on a station, and that Mr. Powis considered too precarious a position to marry on. In vain had Ormond, who was eager for a speedy marriage, urged that, a great portion of his payment having been in ntjock, so soon as some land on which he had determined should be thrown open to selection he would be able to start on his own account. Mr. Powis was obdurate. Ismonc's happiness wns not to be lightly risked; and however loftily pooplo may talk about " being inde pendent of ri�:h��s," anil " ttudiu� their lmppi nt'xs within tiioniselvos," ite., itc, Mr. Powis knew ni much about that iw anyone. In after 

 years ho wished he had not been so prudent- Risk is the beat prudence sometimes. To venture wisely shows the clever man. Finding that Mr. Powis would not consent to their marriage while he was still a dependent, Ormond proposed to Mr. Gurney, who was an old and staunch friend of Mr. Powis's, to make him junior partner in the Pickering station. It was a daring proposal from a young fellow in Ormond's position to one in Mr. Gurney's, but Mr. Gurney liked the audacity; it was in keeping with the spirit and determination Ormond displayed in everything. "Nothing venture, nothing have" was his motto, and he acted up to it in valiant style. He did not get what he ventured for in this case, for, though Mr. Gurney took the proposal in good part, he said that a certain sum must be forthcoming as his share of the capital. He might as well have asked Ormond to pay in five millions as five hundred; and Ormond, having ransacked his brain in vain to find some means by which he could raise the money, gave it up as hope less, and thought no more about the matter� only worked harder and lived more sparingly, to be ready to carry out his first plan directly the opportunity offered. Ormond was a philosopher; if a tiring was possible he left no stone unturned that might help him to effect his object; if it was absolutely out of his reach�well, he acknowledged to himself that it was out of his reach, and gave the matter no moro thought. Not so Mr. Powis. He was slower at arriving at conclusions, and ex perience had taught him that what is not possible one day may be possible another; and now time had once more proved him right. He had not said much about possibilities to Ormond, but he had cudgelled his brain to find some way of raising the required sum. "You have plenty of time to spare," was all he said in answer to a renewed effort of Ormond's to get him to consent to their being married at once. This speech was made only the day before he had said to Mrs. Verner, " Life is too short to wait;" but it would not do to let the young ones into the sad secrets that becomo ours by mere force of time rolling over our heads. Now ten times the required sum was thrust upon him. " God is good!" a Mussulman would have exclaimed at once. But, as we see, Mr. Powia was doubtful about accepting the proffered gift, and hummed and had, and " considered." The Christian's conscience differed from the Mussulman's, though common sense without doubt was with the latter. Chapter IV. " I wonder how Mary will take it V Mr. Powis said to himself as ho went to tell his wife of Mrs. Verner's intentions. He was not quite sure how she would regard it; she had a high spirit, and her delicacy might revolt from accepting such a benefit from one quite un connected with them. To his gratification and no slight relief�for the superior-sexed animal knew what it was to quail before his inferior- Mrs. Powis's practical mind jumped at once to the conclusion which he haa come to with so much reflection. "Itis a regular godsend, Ambrose; now Ismenc can be married at once; poor child, she has been very patient." " Patient! Why she is only just eighteen." "Well, I was only seventeen when you married me, Mr. Powis, and you would not wait any longer. Ismene has been engaged nearly a year." " Oh, well, the probation is nearly over, and they are none the worse for it." " None the better either. Ido not like long engagements, nor do you, you know that, though of course you won't say what you really think�'it would not be prudent;'" and with this quotation of a favourite saying of her husband, and a hearty kiss on his wrinkled forehead, Mrs. Powis left the room to seek Mrs. Verner. Probably these two feminine natures under stood one another, for each showed traces of having indulged in a "good cry" when they severally re-appeared; and it was with more than her wonted tenderness that Mrs. Powis helped the invalid to undress, after which she went to seek her husband in his study. " I am afraid it will not be very long before Ismene will inherit her fortune," she said, as she sat down on the opposite side of the writing table to her husband; ''she grows weakor every day." ''Yes, I can see that," replied Mr. Powis gravely. " She has not much to live for, she says, and it is true enough ; but what a sad life ! Oh ! what a sad life that has been !" and the good hearted kindly little lady rested her head on her hands, and let the tears fall freely. "We must cheer her as much as wo can, Mary. Let Ismene be constantly with her; she likes that." " Yes, I know, and Israene is with her a good deal, but still, you know, even for her I cannot saorifico the child." " Sacrifice ? What do you mean ?" " You don't understand, Ambrose, how sad dening it is to a young girl to be much with one so sorrow-stricken and suffering as Minnie; it trios even me, and I can always see its dc pressing effect on Israene. I must think for tier and Ronald." " As for Ronald I should think he could very well look after himself," said the parson, a little impatiently, " but of course for Isrnehc it is different. You don't think her low-spirited because of the delay, do you?" " No, no! Don't you understand that Israene is delicate and very impressionable? When you read ' Marmion to her docs she not fire up and look like a soldier every inch; and when you road ' Queen Guinevere' is she not sad and cast down for hours after? It is just that; with Ronald xhc is as gay as a lark; it does one good to hoar them laugh; but when she is witli Minnie for any length of time she looks wan and worn." " Doos she ?" said the father anxiously. " I had not observed. You notice all these things liioro than I do." " I should not notice thorn much if I did not, you dear old mole," was the reply, accompanied by another caress. " Well, thon, the sooner they are married the bettor, Mary. I can manage to get the monoy now from Marks." " Yes, the better, no doubt. Everybody else has thought that a long time ; it was only you who would not hoar about it." " I was afraid of tlio risk ; but there is no dif ficulty now. Poor Mrs. Verner ! poor woman ! Things right themselves for everyone except her. Never a ray of joy�no break in the clouds� storm from beginning1 to end. If she had heard of nor sister's child even, it would have boon a comfort." " Ves,"saiil Mrs. Powis, a little doubtfully, "but it would not have beenbogood forldmene, 

 and I am sure Isracno is as much to her as any niece." Mr. Powis smiled feebly at the mother's weakness. Wonion are really tigerish by nature. They have no mercy where their own Drood in concerned. Cicero says nothing is so spiteful as a woman, and certainly nothing is so selfish as a mother. Whether it was only the restlessness of illness, or whether there were some inward pre monitions that told her the end of her troubled life was drawing near, Mrs. Verner scarcely rested till Mr. Marks, the Warroo lawyer, had been sent for to make her will. It was only about six months since the money had actually come into her possession, for, although the death of the testator who had bequeathed it had occurred some considerable time before, the beautiful delay and prolixity which besets everything in which the lawyers have a finger prevented ncr from getting any benefit of it till quite recently. The interval that had elapsed since then had been spent in a last effort to find news of her long-lost sister, or her sister's daughter, Marcia Harcourt. But of neither could she obtain the slightest intelligence, and Mrs. Verner felt sure that Mrs. Harcourt must have died soon after the last letter from her, in which she said that both she and the child were very ill, and that her husband was absent. It was a relief when answers came from agents in different places to whom she had written with instructions to search for tidings, although they brought no good news. So far as she was concerned, that matter was ended too. She had her will drawn up forthwith, leaving every thing she possessed solely and entirely to " her friend in affliction, Ambrose Powis, in trust for his daughter Ismene." She signed it, and then�as if her work in this weary world was over�she fell asleep. That is the simplest way to express her death. So quiet�so unmarked�so untroubled. She went to bed and fell asleep, and that was all. The end for her. The beginning for Ismene. When the will was made, Mr. Powis re opened the subject of the purchase of a part nership in the station to Ronald, and he, nothing loth, was quick to broach the subject to Mr. Gurncy, who was as willing to accept him as a partner as ever. The matter was put in train; and, after a short period of mourning for Mrs. Verner should have expired, the young people were to be married. So, once again, "manproposed." Mrs. Verner died at the end of March. It had been not only an unusually hot summer, but the heat had been of unusually long dura tion. For the past three years it had been an almost continuous drought, and weather-wise people were prognosticating a flood. Perhaps the wish was father to the thought; at all events, it was a very likely consummation in this land of extremes; and the state of the country was such that it made it a matter to be prayed for in church and chapel, by those who believed in the power of man's superior wisdom to improve the arrangements of the Almighty; and to be silently longed for by those who believe that no matter how the individual may suffer the ordering of Providence is for the feneral good, and to be endured with philosophy y such as believe that everything happens in accordance with fixed laws, the strange order ing!* and reasons for which are inscrutable to our eyes, and that man's prayers and desires, or sufferings and lamentations, are as power less to effect an alteration as is the insect to stay the progress of the locomotive in its speed. Mr. Gurney looked round on his starving sheep and his brown bare pastures, and sighed. He had sent flocks travelling in all directions, but not to much purpose ; it was the same tale everywhere, and there were scouts on every station to see that no flock strayed one yard from the lawful road, or stayed an hour longer than the law allowed. It was all in vain, this labour and expense and heart-burning. The tracks taken by the wretched animals were lined with the dead and dying; every waterhole was surrounded by carrion; animals of all sorts lay there; the wild and the tame, the kangaroo and the sheep, all came perforce to save their lives by a drink of the muddy waters, which each day receded further and further from their banks; and in the effort to save their lives they lost them, bogged deep in the trampled mud. It is well that drovers and station owners get used to such sights, and steeled to the sufferings of the poor brutes. Not a blade of green grass was to be seen for miles round. The hot winds that had prevailed at the beginning of the year had scorched the grass ; all was brown, save where a great tract of black told that a bush fire had swept along, carrying desolation with it; but, as we are told of other calamities, and try hard to believe, leaving good behind it; for where the bluck tract now was, the first of the new grass would shoot. Certainly Mr. Powis was right in deciding that Ismcne's comfort should not depend on the fluctuations of the season ; the present con dition of things justified him in his decision ; if rich squatters could barely hold their own, what could the struggling selectors do ? The selectors did whatthoy could, they strove; and starved, and starved and strove ; they lived on little, and worked like slaves; and they pitcously besought a paternal government to remit part of their rents, and n paternal govern ment sternly refused. It seemed a good thing for Ronald Ormond that he was not a selector in those days; for Israene that she was not a selector's wife. If Ormond had taken up a selection and married when he wished, he would not have gone travelling with sheep for Mr. Gurney just as the long prophesied flood came down ; and then, well then, all that came to pass perhaps would never have been. But it was as it was, and Ronald Orraond was despatched in charge of a large flock of valuable sheep that were to do sent out west. [TO BK CONTINUED.] 

 A man was once before the late Judge Kent, of Maine, on a charge of having burglariously entered a lumberman's camp und stolen nothing and money. The witness for the Government testified tliat ho saw the prisoner* head. right arm, and shoulder thrust through un opening lie had mude in tho cabin, and that the stolen articles disappeared with them. Hero the prosecution rested. Whereupon the prisoner's counsel went to the jury gravely protesting that there was no case; ihnt. to make out a case of burglary the prosecution must show an on trance of the whole man-at least the larger part of him: the feet as well as the head must have been within the cabin. Judge Kent instructed the jury to return a verdict of guilty to the extent which the evidence would warrant. After a hriof absence the .jury returned a verdict of guilty against the prisoner as to his right linn, right shoulder, and head, and the judge sentenced the arm. shoulder, and head to) he State prison tor two years. The prisoner might do with the remainder of his body as he pleased.
