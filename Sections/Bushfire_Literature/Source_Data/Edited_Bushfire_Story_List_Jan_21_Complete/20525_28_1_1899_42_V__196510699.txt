 CHAPTER V. 

 Molllo hurried off to Sunday school with Geordle. Effie had a headache. She was often thus afflicted on Sunday afternoon. Vivien watched the pair from the. veran dah till they were out of sight. Then she went Into the dinlugrooin, where Dugald lay 

 extended on the sofa, having relieved him self of his little loved collar. "I'm going over to the little church," she enid. "Will you come, too?" "Will you let a fellow go without his collnr?" "Your company would he too .dear at the price, my hoy," she said. "I'll come anyhow," Dugnld said. "It's the WcBleyan Sunday school over there, Isn't it?" . r "Let's see. Oh, yes, the Church of Eng land had It Inst Sunday. Don't be long, Dugald," Vivien waited on the verandah for hlui. 

 ana made a buttonhole tnat was an exact counterpart of the one Tom Watts bad ob tained In the morning. She fastened It in her brooch. Mrs. Campbell satisfied herself that Vi rion's belt was faultlessly tidy, and Elilo shouted good-bye from the hammock where she lay wllbln arm's length of the passion fruit. The afternoon sun laid a heavy, drowsy otlUucsis on the earth. The orchard grass wus vibrant with Insect music, and the ci cadas' umjqlatlng notes were deafening. They went across paddocks, Dugald look ing sadly over the fence at the scanty brownish green rows that attempted to he the potato crop. "I must begin banking 'em to-morrow," he Bald. "If we got rain even now they'd go ahead grand. If ever there was a humbug ging season It's this one. I fully expected that we should pay off a double lot of that money this year, because we've hired so little labor, only PhU Macarty and Mrs. In- rornrlty, and here, I fancy, we'll have our work cut out to pay the usual amount. There's not a bad lot of sheep to send to Melbourne, though. I wns telling mother we'd bettor send 'em down before the food gets worse. They're not in half bad con dition." "Don't be so glum, then, Dngald,; that 1b not had. We shall pull through.". "Right enough, if the place were ; free. Oh, I'd starve for a year to pay It off In a lump." "Walt till I get a thousand each for my pictures," Vivien returned, smiling. "Seri ously, though, I wonder If they would soil. I'm afraid they're rather crude as yet. At any rate, Dugald, oid lad, we've paid more than half the mortgage. I think mother has done wonders," "YeB, I know," Dugnld said; but his eyes still held a gloomy shadow for present evils. MlyallAin North was a microscopic town ship. The thick hush suddenly blossomed with a mechanics' Institute, a State school and the schoolmaster's bouse, both as neat and nice as Government buildings should he; and a hotel, where cloth of gold roses crept over the house, and ragged weeping willows Wept yellow leaves like tears because of .the drought; and old men, with pipoB," perma nently resided on the (lusty-floored veran dah. A grey, wooden chimneyed erection, wbcroon a huge V.R. betokened the post offlco, stood back In the tl-tree. Then the road curved Into the duflky forest again. 

 Down by a rush-grown creek, with a back ground of llghtwoods and mossy stemmed blanket musks, stood the little church. The Anglicans and Wcslcyans shared It. When the Campbells wanted their Presby terian church, they drove to Miyallam. Feopie and horses were congregated In the church paddock. Tom Watts detached him self from a group of ungainly figured lads, and came to meet the brother and sister. "Good afternoon, Vivien," he said, shak ing hnnds as if for the first meeting In six months. "Well, Dugnld, old feller, how are you? Sunday school ain't out yet, and the preacher ain't come neither." Vivien drew them on to the little slab shanty that did duty as a Sunday school. "Come quietly," she said. "I want to see how they teach." Tbey peeped in at the door. Nellie Al- lonby, Vivien's faithful chum, was sorting texts at her desk � dn inver/td packing case� while her class en joyed Itself. Geordle and Jimmy Watts engaged In an experiment, which concerned the noiseless letting out of air from a squeaking balloon. Of course they failed, and a hideous howl resulted, and two heads sank low In n joyful giggle. "Young scamps," Vivien said. Nellie Allonby looked up reprovingly, then she saw Vlvten and the boys at the door, and the color rose In her fair face. She cnuie quickly to the door. "Vivien, you horror," she cried In a whisper. "If you don't go at once I shall ask Mr. Mncdonnell to remove you. How can I teach with you here?" "Just half a minute, Nell; we want to sec Mollle," Vivien said. Thoy peered round the corner. Unconscious Mollle fronted a form furnish ed with small, round headed boys and sun- bonnctcd little girls. She had a child on her lap, and one leaning on each side ; Morpheus claimed the trio. Young William Inverarlty, whoso face was the contentment of Effle's pen, sat by her, cleverly poised on a kerosene case, and plunged in the pro- foundest deep of sulklness. .Mollle earnestly expounded the duty of children to parents. "Even the smallest children can help their nurents," she said, "Now what can you do for your mothers to help them?" "Gettln' wood for her," rose In metallic, 

 unanimous chorus. "I � I � hold the baby for my mother while she gets tho dish to wash It In," pnt In an eager youth. "My does It when Johnnie's at school," said his smaller brother. "Our baby's got two teeth," announced a prim but irrelevant little girl, with a curled fringe. "Go on, she ain't. Anyhow, ours has got four." M-ollie wns just mentioning that, though such facts were of fascinating Interest, they were scarcely suited to tho time or place, when she looked up and saw the In truders. Her tongue failed her, her cliceks grew hot. She looked appeullngly at Nellie. Willie Inverarlty came to her relief. Ne glecting to Bit still, he overbalanced, and suddenly found his box fiat on tho floor and his- stout, young body firmly wedged In the cavity. Molllo stretched out a hand of rescue and upset her sleeping babies. A chorus of wall- lug grief arose, and Willie stood up with a look of silent, sulky fury, that sent the visi tors out of doors with much laughter. 

 "IIullo, Gwendoline," Vivien cried to a girl, standing outside the fence, "I didn't see you before." "I've Just come," Gwendoline said, with little grace. She did not love Vivien. She was a sturdily built girl, In the conclu sion of her teens. Her hair was red. Not Rossettl's most ardent disciple could have found In It a redeeming glenm of gold. "Brick red," Eflle said, with harsh, but accurate description. She wore It with a little, frizzled fringe, and a little, tight knot. Her face was com- monplnce and abundantly freckled, but her eyes were beautiful. They were dark, with an unusual range of expression. "Jewels In the toad's bend," Efflc said again; and Mollle threatened to upset her In the washtub for speaking so of a human being. Gwcn's eyes were often sad. Vivien tried to pnlnt them front memory, but always failed; and Gwcn refused to give her a sit ting, for It was because of Vivien that her eyes were sad. Not that Vivien meant to do her any hurt. Tom Watts was the first cause. Before Vivien, the now planet, swam into his ken, he had been very attentive to Gwen, who lived on the selection nearest to his own. Gwen's heart, warm as her hair, was straightway given to Tom. Then he sud denly fell In love with Vivien. Vivien laughed at his curious conversation, and went her way serenely unconsclow tlint Gwen longed to nnuihllnte her. But she was conscious of a certain coldness and opposi tion when she spoke to Gwcn, -and having a youthful wish to he universally, liked, she accordingly beamed with more exceeding graclousncss upon the young lndy, If by nny means she might melt that obilurnte heart. Gwen told liersclf that she would not mind so much If Vivien only appreciated Tom, and knew bow kind ho was to his little brothers and 'Sisters. Gwen never had a hard thought for Tom. Vivien wns drawing her Into grudging conversation when the school streamed out. Mollle disengaged herself from the cluster ing children, nnd went straight to Mrs. Humphries, who held a white robed baby. The baby slipped from Its mother's arms to Mollle's. It wns n charming specimen of Its kind; the sweetest In the district, Mollle said; aud she knew most of them.- The men laughed to see how oblivious she was to all else. Mr. Humphries humbly en treated for a handshake. "I've always to play second Addle since she came on the scene," he said. Mollle blushed like a sunset cloud, and put out two fingers from flic baby's embroidered dress to shake hands' with them. nil. "Mrs. Humphries, -.do let me have her In church," she entreated. "Pass her to' ine If she cries then, dear," 

 Mrs. Humphries said, and Mollle went up the steps into the church. The minister galloped up spurring his hot horse. He apologised for being late, as he had had d little matter of 25 miles .to ride, and he had fallen among bush fires. "The fires are doing terrible damage round Wnrragul," he said. "I only hope your dis trict will escape. Miss Campbell, will you piny for us, our usual organist will not be present." "Certainly, Mr. Ruthvon," Vivien said, and the minister went Into church with his flock In tow. Tom was glad when Vivien nlayod. It gave, him a right to sit next lier, and turn her music, for he, too, wns an instrumen talist, and Bwellcd the volume of sound with his violin. Its tones were somewhat harsh, and to a certainty Stradlvarlus had had no hand In its construction, but Tom was al ways at his post to lend when organists failed, and was useful and respected accord ingly. "Sit on tho other side of me, Nell," Vivien whispered. Gwcn Delnney was In the seat behind. She sang, or tried to sing, second to Nellie. In front of the organ Vivien could just see a row of cheeky, bobbing heads . The cheekiest of them all was Geordie's. Through the open side door she saw golden brown butterflies circling In the blue, and graceful fern fronds swaying Tn tho tl-tree. At intervals a rickety calf scurried across the open bit of grass, followed by a worry ing dog. , A sheep ambled to the door, and stood with its front feet on the step, serenely viewing the ' face of the congregation. It expressed its conclusions in a loud "Ba-al" and a tremendous tittering explosion came from the row of heads lu front of the organ. A pillar of the church ejected the animal, and two jackasses outside gave themselves to uproarious laughter over It. They were singing the last hymn, Tom, with his violin, executing a difficult passage, when a fly alighted on his cheek. He-made several futile attempts to reach it Willi- his tongue as the only available weapon.', y ' Vivien glanced at Nellie, and shw Amilea. quivering round her mouth. Ne(lie' mokeflf down at Vivien with merry eyes, and saw- that her face wns crimson with suppressed laughter. The playing wavered, and.. Nellie watched her anxiously, but Vivien wdiif xm; bravely ts the end. ">-4 "That boy will be the death of me yet," she whispered, as she sank her face Into her handkerchief on the key board for the last prayer. The red haired girl behind saw It all, nnd was angry that her hero should be a mark for mirth to two careless girls. (To be continued.)
