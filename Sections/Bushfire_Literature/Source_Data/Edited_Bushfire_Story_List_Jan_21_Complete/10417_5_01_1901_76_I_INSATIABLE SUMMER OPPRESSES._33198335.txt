 CHAPTER I. - - " INSATIABLE SUMMER OP- 

 PRESSES." 

 Bich�rd Lawrence left the cool, pleas- ant shade of his study and wandered out on to the vine-clad verandah. 

 It was the beginning of December, and already the touch of a burning sum- mer had fallen upon the land� scorching and bleaching the grass until it lay in yel- low tangled masses beside the dazzling whiteness of the mountain roads. 

 Yes, even in this pleasr^. little vil- lage among the hills the air was hot and sultry, and the man who stood upon the vine-clad verandah sighed and longed for one of the fresh, cool breezes of spring. 

 Then he gazed away down the sloping garden, where the peaches and apricots were ripening in the grateful warmth ol summer. And he sighed again. 

 _ Not very long ago no peach had ever ripened there, no apricot yellow and juicy had attracted the .gaze of the passer-by. end Richard Lawrence, seeing in. the gar- dens round about thc trees all laden with 

 frnit, had asked why-his alone were bare. 

 Seeking then he had found the*�nswer in the merry boyish faces of Robert and Jack, his brothers, surely, the best and withal the most mischievous boys in the vicinity of Aldgate. 

 They were orphans, and wholly depen- dent on this studious, book-loving broth- er of theirs. They had lived with him row for many years, almost since th�>y had been oid enough to remember, and during those years they had learned to love-nay, to idolise-him almost with a truly brotherly affection, pitying him in their boyish hearts because he refused to join in the many pleasures that made up their own fresh young lives. 

 But a day came when Richard Law- rence awoke to a sense of his responsi- bility. These boys would need a profes- sion some day, and ought to be properly educated. 

 And then a suitable school had bein discussed, and as a result they had gone to a large boys' college in Sydney, where they had remained ever since. 

 That had been three years ago, whon Robert was fourteen, and Jack twelve years old, and now, for the first time, they were returning home for the holi- days^ 

 During those three years a change had taken place in their step-brother's house- hold. Dick, the quiet, the retiring, bad married �pretty little brown-haired girl of twenty. And he had brought her to his home in the hills unhesitatingly, never dreaming that a solitary existence such as his would throw a gloom upan her bright young spirits, and make lier life distasteful to her. 

 That TSeva loved her husband was un- disputed. "That he returned her affec- tion was also apparent. - But without knowing it his love was selfish. In truth his books still held his first thoughts, and the heart of his girl wife could not be satisfied with the secondary affection h�; bestowed upon her. She would_ fain have joined him m his literary pursuits-aid jd him and sympathised with him in the 

 work he loved-but she was a nervous giri, and stood somewhat in awe of her grave, quiet husband. And so their Uves drifted on until almost a year had passed since their marriage. 

 And new the two boys were returning home, and Richard, as he stood upon the verandah, wondered vaguely if they were improved, and hoped that they would not wory or tease his girl wife. 

 Then he drew from his pocket a much crumpted letter, and read it perhaps for th e twentieth time. 

 "Dear old Dick," it ran, "just a line or two to bid you make hay while tho sun shines,- as after to-morrow week there �viii be no peac�- for the inhabitants of Turtle's Nest;' ~ (You know^y�u were always too lazy to give the old place a name. Dick ; so we, Bob and I, after due 

 consideration, came to this conclusion, 

 that Turtle's Nest' will do. - It isn't original, you. know. Some learned Johnnie wrote a poem about it, I ex- : peet you'll know whom I mean, though I don't.) However, as I was saying, we shall be home on the 17th, so you and "Neva had better spoon round all you know in the meantime. You won't have much show when we're round, I reckon. How are the apricots ripening? I am just dying for a taste of tho green ones. We haven't a chance even to steal them up here. v Bob has won no end of prizes this term. And now good-bye. .Love to Neva if she'll have it from Jack." 

 Dick Lawrence turned the letter over thoughtfully. It had never occurred to him that these young brothers of his would expect him to have changed so 

 completely. To treat his wife with j anything bordering upon ordinary lover- j 

 like affection had never entered bis head, and he wondered uneasily if she also had expected it. 

 Neva was lying upon a cane lounge at the other end of the verandah. He cross- ed over to her with his brother's letter in his hand. 

 - '-Neva," he said, withfsome slight hes- itation," "the boys will be home upon the 17th. ? ~ Ihave just heard from Jack." 

 �era looked np at him quickly, briehtiy. 

 ; i*�our brotherfif she said. "Ohl I am triad." 

 *1 hbpelbey will not worry you very much," he said, with slow surprise, "they are dreadfully noisy, Tm afraid," . - 

 "I shall like them awfully, I am sure," she said, with a ring of pleasant antici- pation in her voice, '1 had brothers Of my own at home, you know, and I al wayslovjsd to romp with them. ' 

 Dick regarded her fdr a moment in a nervous kind of way; Then he rosesud 

 : And-Neva remained upon the yeran* dah�looking out Across the. bilk} and thinking. -: -.'.'.i J

 ?THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME." 

 "Hullo ! Dick, old man, �ow are yon? How's Turtle's Nest P Hows every" oueP Is this NevaP It was awfully good of you to meet us," said Jack Lawrence all ta a breath, as he jumped out on the Ald- gate platform a week later. 

 "Yes. indeed, we feel deeply compli- mented," said Robert more seriously, looking with ill-concealed admiration at his beautiful sister-in-law. 

 Neva laughed as she gave him her hand. 

 "Ah!" she said, "I see you are well versed in pretty speeches. But where is your luggage P You will be losing it in a moment, for the train doesn't stay long here^you know." 

 "Oh! Dick has gone to look after that," returned Jack. "I wish he would hurry, too. I'm just dying to get home to the old place, and have a look round. You may prepare yourself for a very rowdy household Mrs. Neva. I hope you won't mind." 

 Neva laughed gaily, and Richard join- ing them at this moment thought he had never feen her so radiantly lovely. 

 "I wonder what has made her so beau- tiful to-night," he asked himself, "with a half-conscious feeling of sadness. Then, "Are you ready-, boys?" he enquired aloud, and they left the station and walked leisurely in the direction of the 

 house. . 

 : It was not very far away-only a few hundred yards-and Jack with his usual high spirits monopolised the whole con- versation, enquiring for people, telling amusing little stories and chaffing his' step-brother. 

 Robert, on the other hand, remained for the most part silent, as he walked along at his sister-in-law's side, helping her over the rougher places, paying her little attentions all the way. Dick no- ticed him with a jealous pang. These were privileges that should have been his, and he felt that his brother was poaching on his preserves. Yet he said nothing. How could he when the girl seamed so happy and contented, and took all their little compliments as her right. 

 Neva had boan long without these'at- tentions; therefore, she appreciated them the more, and a firm friendship was soon established between herself and the two boys. 

 "She is a rea brick," declared Jack, as he and his brother were going up to bed that night, "and she makes just a capital mistress for 'Turtle Nest.' " 

 "She is very beautiful," returned Ro- bert, slowly, "but I think we have made a mistake in our choice of a name, Jack. 'Turtle's Nest' does not suit it somehow." 

 Dick, who was passing through the hall at that moment heard.iSe last word�, and wondered much what his brother meant. 

 Through the days,that followed he learned his meaning but too well. 

 Neva did not love him, he told him- self. 

 At first after his brother's return" he had noticed her increased good spirits, in a dreamy kind of way, attributing the change merely to the presence of a couple 

 of jofiy, good-natured schoolboys. 

 As time were on, however, he began to seo that she was more happy in their companionship than his own, and a feel- ing of passionate jealousy sprang up in his heart against his young step-brothers, especially Robert, whose admiration for Neva was easily seen. 

 Why had she ever consented to marry him ? he wondered. Why had she given tit) her gay, happy life for the company of a retiring student P Then thc thought came to him tuat hers must be a very wearisome existence up here in the hills with few friends, alone with a man whom she could not love. He had been selfish, he felt, and he must endeavour to bright- en her life. At present there were the boys-and afterwards, well, , they might travel or go to live in "town. 

 Christmas had come and gone, and it WHS New Year's Eve. 

 Every day through the holidays they had gone put together those three,. Neva and' the two boys, roaming about over the hills, leaving Dick �lone in his study hut without his old affection for the hook lined room, with a-constant longing in his heart for tha presence of his beauti- ful wife. 

 '. "We will not disturb yon. Dick," she bsd said' to him morning af ter-morning. "I know you would rather remain with your books, and I shall be quite safe with the boys." And she had -ene off and left him there when he would fain have ac- companied her to .the ends of the earth 

 if miffht be. Meanwhile the weather was 

 becoming daily more hot and unpleasant, and many of the gullies were already charred and Blackened by the fierce bush fires raging in places among the hills. 

 Even the heat, however, could not damp the spirits of Neva and her boy friends. When the weather . was too warm for walking they found some shady place among the trees, and rested there. New Year's Eye wa? certainly the worst day they had had during the summer, yet the three had set out as usual, leav- ing Dick in the study alone. 

 He, however, was in a singularly, rest- less mood this morning, and in spite of himself his thoughts would wander from his work. 

 "It is not the slightest use trying to stud^ " he told himself at last, and he took his hat and prepared to follow.the others. ? - 

 They, hadsnoken that morning if visit- ing a favourite nook in a gully a-mile away; but' Dick, without knowing the reason,' walked off in the opposite direc- tion. . 

 CHAPTER m. 

 "WHERE FOREST FIRES REDDEN." 

 Neva and the boys, finding it hotter 

 out of doors than they had. . imagined,.: soon changed their minds aa to the direc- tion of-their walk, and made for a-valley to. the right of the bouse where they had j been told a fire was raging. . - j 

 . "Let us *ee if it has done any .darn-j �ge," suggested Jack, scenting an adven- ! ture,' and the others complied! -The re- j port; how�ver,Jiad been o.false one, fori the fi*A bad not, $et*reacbed the valley, i

 though it wu �ging upon the hills i the further end". 

 - 'lt is not very safe to be near the fires," said Robert^ "they epmetim spread in double quick time, eb I thu we had better stay here beneath the tre and watch proceedings from a distance 

 "I hope the fire will die out before reaches the valley," said Neva, eeatii herself upon the trunk of a fallen tre "About here is one of the nicest places < a hot day and besides, all the ferns won be spoilt." 

 Tm afraid there's no such luck as i stopping," said Robert, "this place h been burnt out before, about three yea ago, and then by jingo, the �ames sprei like wild fire. There's a good deal i dry grass down there at that end." 

 "I pity anyone who did not know tl place, and got caught in that part of tl gully," said Jack, pointing to a spi where the fire in two long scarlet tongu from either side was racing down to caf* up the dry grass in the bed of the emp( 

 creek. 

 "It is just like a race for the mastei between the two tongues," declare Neva. "Look bovs. at that flight t birds. The poor little things are terr 

 fled." 

 A hot, east wind had blown up, eendin the smoke away from them down the (va ley, and feeding the merciless fiemes ti they roared and crackled' more' fierce! 

 than ever. 

 "With a wind like that the fire will nc 

 spread to this part of the valley," sai Robert. "It must go towards the wesl and soon thc whole valley will be ablagt Run home for Dick, Jack. We may b able to db something to stop it." 

 Jack complied willingly enough. H was tired of sitting still. 

 Almost before he was out of sight th figure of a man loomed into view upo: 

 the hillside.. 

 "That fellow will be caught if he's no careful," remarked Robert, noticing him and Neva looked up. 

 "Robert," she exclaimed, turning pale and grasping the boy's arm. "Look, look it is Dick; quickly. Robert, we mus wara him, or he will be burnt." 

 Robert looked up again, and surel; enough recognised his brother. 

 "He does not know these hills," b murmured, more to himself than tb Neva "and he is reckoning upon the flame coming this way instead of towards him That's what comes of being a student." 

 His calmness and apparent unconcen almost sent Neva into a frenzy. 

 "Robert," she exclaimed, shaking hin violently, "what are you thinking of I He will be lost. Do you hear m�, yoi -must save him." * 

 In e moment he had turned upon he: excitedly. 

 "Neva," he said, all the pent-up pas sion of the past weeks, revealed in hu strained tones. "Neva, why should I sav< him ? He does not love you as you oughj to be loved-as I love you. He cannoi make you happy. .If he were dead, w� 

 He paused. Neva was. standing before him. proud, womanly, beautiful. 

 "Robert, he is my husband, and I love him." she said. 

 He was cowed at once. 

 For a moment he stood there before her, an expression of passionate yearning on his young face. The next he was scrambling away among the heath, and trees and brushwood towards that soli- tary figure on the hillside, whom the flames werft fast approaching, but who wandered absent mindedly, ever dreaming 

 of Neva. 

 Robert ran through the fasE narrow- ing opening between the fires, and com- menced to ascend the hillside upon which his brother stood. 

 Dick's back was turned to him, and 

 j the roaring of the flames cut off all possi ! bility of a call being heard. It seemed to j the boy amost an age before he came near 

 to that motionless figure. 

 "Dick," he panted, breathlessly, reach- 

 ing bim at last. 

 Dick turned and faced him in astonish- 

 ment. 

 "You, Bob." he said. "What is HP" Then, suddenlv seizing his arm, "Neva, where is sheP Not-in the valley. She will 

 be killed." 

 Robert summoned all his self-control. "Neva is in the valley, and safe," he al- most hissed. "But you-you and" I-we shall be burnt if we're not quick. Come, the" flames are hemming ns Sn." . 

 But his brother led him back. 

 "The flames will go up the valley," he said, "not this way. Why should they?" 

 "The wind," exclaimed Robert impa- tiently. "Can't you see we shall be suffo- cated. Come on, and don't be a fool," and lie started away down the hill, dragging 

 Dick with him. 

 Dick's studious habits had not prepared him to deal with an emergency, such as this. He was as helpless as a child, and all now depended upon Robert. He dragged his brother fiercely along, over stumps of long dead trees, through the thick bound prickly heath, over the smouldering grass, till they reached the 

 edge of the creek. 

 The hot wind fanned their faces, the" flames threw out greedy hands to catch them as they passed, but Robert was too quick for them, in a moment he had push- ed his brother through the narrow open- ing and with one bound stood beside him safe at last. 

 Neva had hurried up from the other part of the valley. Her face was deadly pale as she rnshed.tb ber husband's side. 

 -"Dick," was all she could say. j ,. "Why. Neva,".b� said, in a bewildered.: tone?? "ttere you afraid Of the fire. Bob: says it will not.come this way, but up the other ~end with the wind." . . . "But,Dick," she said, "if Robert bad not saved you you would have been suffo- cated.", - . 

 '1'would?" said Dick, passing bis hand across his eyes ; then, with a sudden bit- terness, "Ah I bat-that would not have mattered."- . . 

 "Dick/' said his wife reproachfully, and there vas a |rot�d_of.love in ber tone. ^

 - - They stood in the book-lined study fac- ing *acb otbet, Richai^Laweijce ��nd his step-brother, but no one to see them 

 'now weald have dreamed that ios t&an -. an hour ago they had been in peril oflosingi their lives. Bick was leaning against thor 

 'mantelpiece, looking-down affectianatelji> into the pale youngJace of his companion� 

 "You nave savedmy life, Bob," he said' "and I am only beginning to realise it. J am an absent-minded fellow, and bnt for your bravery should doubtless have been done for by now." 

 There was silence for a moment. Then Hebert answered him passionately, eag- erly. 

 "It was for her sake I did it. She loves you, and she made me save you. But you 

 -you are not worthy of her. You do not . love her as I-as she should be loved." 

 Dick turned upon him quickly as be paused for breath. 

 "Tell me," he said excitedly, "does she too think I do not love her-that I would not give my life willingly to make ber happy. Do you really believe that I did not know which way thc dames would come. I am not a fool, Robert. I only thought she would be happier without me. Good gracious, boy, you don't mean 

 to tell me-*.' 

 Bobert had sunk into a chair, covering 

 his face with his hands. In a moment � . 

 light seemed to flash across his brother's 

 mind, and he understood. 

 "Bob," he said, slowly, wpoor.old Bob.*'* Again there was silence in the room. " Then Bobert rose and went over to his 

 companion's side. " . . ? > 

 "Dick," be said. "I ara goipE back to college to work. You^riji be gftoji to bjr, v because you love her and^e4oves>you... She must-nay. she does desniseme now j : but some day I shall make her ~ respect me." V 

 And he took his bat and went slowly : from the room and out on to the vine-clad verandah. ' *. . 

 Neva was sitting there upon a lounge, with Jack at ber side. .She was very pale, but otherwise no worse for her adventure. She rose when she saw the boy, and come' towards bim with outstretched hands. >. 

 "Robert," she said, gently, '.liow can%;. ever thank you ?" He did not look at ber, 

 but pointed in the direction of the study; . "Go to him," he said. ... 

 And she went. 

 For ono long moment he watched ber AS she walked �way up the passage ; then he turned and went down the garden path and out at the wooden gate. -
