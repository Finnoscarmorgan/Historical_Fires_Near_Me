 CHAPTER V. ^Continued.) 

 Another horseman was rapidly coming to wards them, the men did not recognize him in. the fading light; hut before Douglass to aware, he *as fired at, the shot missing its mark. Warren saw the flash and heard the report, and was by the side of bis chief directly afterwards, as Douglass felled the 

 man with a return shot. 

 ' Bad up, and hands down!' Warren cried, ' Or we'll shuot you like possums!' 

 The diggers'did not wait to hear the end of the sentence, but fired at the bushrangers, whom they missed. 

 Tien the bushrangers fired, mortally wounding each of the diggers, who fell 

 without a word 

 The former dismounted ana proceeded to search the faltai diggers,-when one of them suddenly raised himself and fired at Douglass, who was he nearest to nim. This was his last effort to protect his hardly earned gold dust, as Warren fired immediately with fetal 

 effect. _ 

 The other two men appeared so quiet, that the bushrangers intuitively considered 

 them harmless. 

 Douglass shook them, and felt convince J each was dead- Warren commenced to 

 examine their swags. 

 * This night almost equals the one on the "ttfhite Hills,' Warren said, as he unrolled the blankets. ' I don't think they had got over the effects of Murphy's rum, or we should be on our backs.' 

 *My word, it'e red hot,' Douglass said; ' they were real plucky.' 

 The bushrangers found a little cash on each of their victims; but, in the swags, tine, coverced bags were discovered, and carefully 

 placed in their shirts, as the bushrangers 

 did not wear coats. 

 The bodies a-jd swags were dragged fiirthp.r into he bush, and covered with 

 which concealed them entirely from an ordinary glance; and, having obliterated the traces on the ground, the bushrangers took the road back to the creek 

 * By jove, Tom,' Douglass said, 4 We have made a nice trail from the road; thank our luck, it's over. What time it it?' 

 1 Just 10 min. to 9,' Warren replied, look ing at watch, with the light of a match. * We �hflll have to return to-morrow; early too, to rub out some of the traces.' 

 � All right, Tom,' Douglass said, in terrupting; � don t talk about them; its the worst night's work we ever did.' 

 ' So i is, Warren answered. *1 only wish we had a drink ; we can't fetch Murphy's 

 place to-night, nor to-morrow either, for the 

 matter of that.' 

 * My word!' Douglass said, "you'd better believe I don't forget necessities. I have a bottle of Martell's on the saddle; I ammore thoughtful than you are about our comforts.' 

 * Get it, for heaven's sake!' Warren said. 

 < Why, Tom,' Douglass said, 1 you're mrtrfi scared than old Macbeth. We hhftll sever be troubled by those fellows.' 

 ' If we are not very cunning,' Warren said, ' ibis night's work may bring us to 

 grief.' 

 The cork was drawn, as all bush-msn carry a corkscrew in a knife combination. Douglass passed the bottle to his mate, who took along draught, wishing each other the same luck 

 for the future. 

 'Thats wanned me up, a bit,' Warren said. 'Bill, you know we never wanted to pot tLs fools, had they bailed up properlj 

 4 That's just where it comes in,' Douglass fzaidj taking the bottle from his lips. * One can t understand the actions of others, but here's luck to thtir souls.' 

 The horses were quickly pat to a brisk canter, clearing boulders and logs, as though hurrying from tne scene just witnessed. The riders with borrowed courage, mocked fear, and continually dodged the over 

 hanging branches thst extended over the 

 track. 

 The horses were allowed to pick their road, the bushrangers imowing they would go the most oirect route, better than men could guide them in the dark. - 

 BusJa horses see almost equally well at night time, as in daylight. 

 Still travelling at a fast rate where possible, , over undulating country, *-ke horeea at last , began to placken speed, and the riders .could t perceive they were ascending a steep spur, riding on a wallaby line, as it is termed; that is, single file. The animals were puffing 

 and scrambling upwarJs, knocking against ( stump* and stones, and causing stones to i rattle down the slope, as they were dis 

 lodged. < 

 Beaching the saddle back of the spur, the , riders dismounted to give their steeds time to , regain their strength. 

 * It'e a good excuse lor us to have another 

 nobbier Douglass said. 

 'Yes,* Warren replied. 'We have been travelling a deuce of a., pace; not many horses would have brought as through with out a (?pill.' 

 The bushrangers had a refreshing swig from fhe bottle that they carried, and then filled their pipes. 

 1 To-morrow we must bury tie bodies,' Warren said, 'and destroy the tracks more effectually.' 

 'I've been thinking',1 Douglass said, ' which is the best way to prevent the troopers copping the plant; perhaps burying it, but how to do it without our chaps at the cave knowing, puzzles me.' 

 "Than you don't intend to enlighten them,' Warren said, about our haul.' 

 'I did not, intend them to know it,' Douglass remarked. * You and I can share alike; besides, money is no good to them, they only drink it. And we are always risking being trapped by the infernal fools. I propose to plant the bags to-night, not far from here, as I think we are on the Blackridge, overlooking our patch of scrub, about eight miles from the cave�What do you fo'Tilr ?' 

 ' I am blessetl if I know exactly,' Warren answered, ' where we are; I thought I saw the top of the mountain, standing out against the sky some time ago; if so, we most be nearer the cave than you think, but, bother it,�it's extra dark to-night,'.taking another big drop from the bottle�" I guess, that's why those mopokes are so jolly lively down that black looking gully; I vote for a camp here until daylight. 

 ' I'll swear 'St. Peter* has'nt missed the road,' Douglass said. 'But, even if he was tight, your bally' would soon put him straight. It s no use reaching home in the middle of the night for 1 guess it's 2 o'clock by the right air.' 

 'Close up; its half past one o'clock,' Warren said. ' ' Anyhow, we are not far from the cave; our cattle have brought us a short cut, though, may be, by a rough road. I think I remember this ridge now; "we'll bring the horses under the lea of the top.' 

 The bushrangers quickly camped down behind a boulder, with a fallen tree lying at T-ighf: angles. Warren found a clean space, with a little grass. Here he tethered the horses, and rejoined Douglass; who, mean while had built up a small fire; for,.even in 

 the middle of summer, the air is raw and often very cold during the small hours of the -night- The fire sticks were laid blaefefellow fashion, to avoid causing smoke, or too much light. 

 When all was snuggly arranged, the bottle again kissed the lips of both in dividuals ; afterwards, it was carefully laid under the fallen tree, awaj from harm. 

 The two men smoked atad exchanged ideas of future action. 

 'Very well/ Warren said. 4To-morrow we return to the Melbourne road.' , 

 * We shall have to be extra fly,' Douglass 

 >aid. ' Curlew has the scent of a dingo, and ' ".might track us; he's-half suspicious t>� our; actions, and is always growling.' 

 ' No fear,' Warren said. ' ' 111 bet we're a 

 match for b'1"�confound, thoss bears down : there, 4>ne would thinV they were demons 

 roaring- I hate the noise; it Seems to | portend ho good�push ub the' bottle, Bill.' 

 * Tom, you're not yourself to-day, what's scared you? nothing wiil happen, old man,' Douglass said. _ 

 Warren continued talking, and informed his friend about the meeting with Mora Murphy arid its results. 

 * I should advise you to abandon that idea; 

 women and our profession don't mix; I say, j 

 cut it! Or you'll get yarded as sure as I am j telling you; Murphy won't stand it, I know,' j 

 Douglass said. 

 'Between ourselves, Bill,' Warren said. ' I am about full of Murphy; I'll put a hole through Wm yet; he's too thick with 

 Curlew.' 

 �I don't want to fall out with you,' Douglass said. ' But don t talk like that; and, take my tip, don't go after JElora Murphy again.' 

 They now lay down with a blanket covering on each side .of the fire. Before daylight both awoke, awaiting 'the advent of another day. With the first streak of light in the western sky, a gentle murmur re sounded from all around; the birds, insects, and all nature appeared to sing and feel delight in beholding the red sun rising through the mist, from the masses of purple foliage, edging the distant mountain dopes. The perfume of the gum trees, wattles and grass filled the air, while the hill and gullies appeared clothed with the softest waves of 

 velvet in nature's forest forms. 

 The horses were saddled and mounted, and passed between the black burnt stems, and stumps, the effects of a. bush fire during thp previous summer. . 

 ' I say. Douglass ?' Warren remarked, as they rode together. 'I wonder we did'nt get our heads or less broken last . night coming through this close timber; I suppose we'll be in camp in an hour, unless we turn up to the Bluff rocks to plant our swag.' 

 ' I dare say the Bluff rocks will do as we'l as anywhere,' Douglass said. ' So push 

 ahead.' 

 The horses felt the lightness of therein and the gentle touch of the spur, and went into a gallop down the fall of the ridge, through trees and saplings, and over bogs, regardless of sudden drops from tlows of quartz. Dangers cannot be perceived when the high kangaroo grass grows up to the horses flanks, almost like cane on these mountain spurs. 

 After cro-sing a few gullies and light ranges, they altered the pace to a walk, at a nasty bit of boulder country, and headed for a mile up a steep and almost impassable gully, at whose head stood a wall of rock fully two hundred feec high, showing in dications that in a heavy wet season huge volumes of water leaped from the top, and rushed down the gully carrying away loose earth and stones in its impetuosity to reach the level ground. 

 Hie bushrangers proceeded a few hundred yards along the g'llly, when they dismounted, slinging the bridles over a stump, and walked up the side of the water course, where they perceived a comparatively fiat patch of ground on a lightly covered ridge. 

 Douglass said, the place would suit them admirably, pointing to a large tree, with numerous boulder rocks lying about; one was found with basin or pocket, formed in it by nature, and fit for their purpose. 

 When the bags of gold and the contents of their pockets were placed upon the ground, they opened the bags to satisfy themselves. 

 ?"Not a bad lift,' Warren said. * But what a price we have paid for it!' 

 ' I don't t.Kinlr so,' Douglass replied. ' Both of us were targets, and precious near drilled through by the fools before we played their own game. Why, if they had known how to use a bull dog, both of us would have been a supper to the dingoes or my name is not Bill Douglass.' �� 

 ' My word!' Warren said. ' It's a good job we polished them off properly; guess they'd made it cursed hot for us. Even now, their ghosts in tae hot weather may bring up the troopers; we must hurry along to morrow, as they are sure to be found by some traveller, that may have a better scent 

 than bi� mates.' 

 'We'll manage it all right,' Douglass said. 'When they are found, no one can ever bring it home to us�unless, he s the very old one himself. I don't believe the best blackfellow in the country could track us�even if they got trackers to hunt round,' 

 ' Well, if ever blacks should be put on the scent, they will find the gold first, and we are sure then to loose the lot,' Warren 

 said. 

 'Never miud,' Douglass replied. ' We are sure to have plenty of warning; so can re move the plant when the time comes. Be quick and stow the lot: there are six and a half bags; they each weigh about the same. My word! I feel all the lighter and more 

 comfortable since they are out of my shirt �. they were both a precio jb and an awkward aargo.'
