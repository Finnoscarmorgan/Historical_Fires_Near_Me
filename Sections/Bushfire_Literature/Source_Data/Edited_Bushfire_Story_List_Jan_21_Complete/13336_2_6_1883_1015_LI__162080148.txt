 Chapter LI. 

 So Mr. Knightley stood up and faced them aU,,like ajnaan. He was one of those chaps that makes up their mind pretty quick about the sort of people they've got to deal with, and if there's anything to be said or done, lets 'em have it 'fetraiRht from the shoulder.' As he stood tnere- straight and square� with his head thrown back, and his eyes, very bright and sharp they were� looking every man's face over &b if he was reading a notice and had no time to spare, you couldn't have told, from his look, or voice, or manner, whether he was afraid that things would go wrong, or. whether he was dead ;sure they'd go right. Some men are like that. Others you can tell every thought thafe passing through their minds just as if it was printed ia big letters \\ ontteir breast* like a handbill: � �200 reward?' and so ( ''Veil, Mr. Knightley wasn't one of that eort, though I 

 saw him keep his eye a trifle longer on Moran than the rest of 'em. ' Now then, boyB.' he says, '.we've had our flutter out. I've done my best, and you've done yours. I've bagged one of your lot, and you've done your best to pot me. See here,' and he lifts up the collar of his coat and shows a hole through it, touches his head on the side, and brings away a red mark: and takes out his watch with the case all battered in by a revolver bullet. ' You can't say I hadn't cause to show fight,' ' and he points to his wife. ' Where's the man among you that wouldn't have done the same? An Englishman's house is his castle. What am I to expect ? ' He looked over at Starlight, but he didn't take no notico, and made no sign. I saw Mrs. Knightley look over at him too. It was the first time I ever seen him look hard when there was a woman in the case, and such a one ! but he kept bis face set and stern like. Then Moran breaks in. ' Expect be blowed ! What the ? do you expect now we've got yer torights, are we going to let you off after knocking over Daly. No dashed fear, Mister, we'll serve you the same way as you served him, as coon as we've had some grub and another glass or two of your grog. You've got some fairish stuff here.' 'Why, Moran '(' says Mr. Knightley, still making believe to joke, and by George ! if he could laugh then, he could sing a song with a bullet through him. ' You're getting bad tempered rince you used to be horse-breaking for Mr. Lowe. Don't you remember that chestnut Sir Henry colt, that no one else could ride, and I backed you not to get thrown, and won a fiver. But I'm a man of the world and know how to play a losing game at billiards as well as most men. Look here now ! Daly's dead. We can't bring him to life again, can we? If you shoot me, you'll betrothing to the good, and have every spare man in the three colonies at your heels. This is a game of brag, though the stakes are high. I'll play a card. Listen. You shall have 100 fivers � �500 in notes, by to-morrow at 4 o'clock, if you'll let Mrs. Knightley and the Doctor ride to Bathurst for the money. What do you eay ? ' 'Damn you 'end your money too,' growled Moran. 11 We'll have your blood, and nothing else. D'ye hear that 'r1 You're a dead man now ; if you're not buried by this time to-morrow, it won't be because you're not as ready for it as Patny is.' I saw Mrs. Knightley turn round and clasp her hands, her fuce grew as white as death, but she Baid nothing, only looked over at Starlight, and her eyes grew bigger and big ger, while her mouth trembled just the least bit. ' You're off your head, Moran,' Eays Mr. Knightley, pulling out a cigar and lighting it. ' But I suppose you'ro the chief man, and all the rest must do as you tell them.' ' Suppose we talk it over,' says Starlight, very quiet, but I knew by the first word that he spoke something was coming. ' Daly dropped, end it can't be helped. Accidents will happen. If you play at bowk you must take rubbers. It has been a fair fight, no one can say otherwise. Let us put it to the vote. I propose that Mr. Knightley's offer be accepted. Not that I intend to take a shilling of the money.' 'Ivor me either,' says I. ' So you three chaps will have it to share between you. I don't see that we can do better. A fight's a fight, and if Fatscy got his gruel, it might have happened to Mr. Knightley himself. As for shooting in cold blood, I'm not on, and so 1 tell you.' ' I suppose you think you and Starlight's going to boss the lot of us, because you've been doing it fine at the Turon races, along with a lot of blasted swells as 'ud scrag the lot of us if they had the chance, and we're to take so much a head for our dashed lives, because we're only working chaps. Not if Dan Moran knows it. What we want is satisfaction� blood lor blood � and we're a goiu' to have, eh, mate ?' 'Wall and Hulbert hadn't said anything before this. They were not bad chaps underneath, but Moran was such a devil when he was raised that they didn't like to cross him. Besides, they had a down on Mr. Knightley, and wanted to sheet it him home to him somehow. They had got to the brandy, too, and it didn't make matters any better, you take my word for it. Starlight didn't speak for a minute or two. I couldn't think what he was at. If Jim had been there,, we should have been right. Three to three. Now we were two to three. 1 knew Starlight had a good card to play, and was ready to play it, but he was waiting on the deal. Mr. Knight lev must have had some sort of notion of the hand� he was wonderful quick at picking up the points of the game. He said nothing, and looked as cool as you please; smoking his cigar as if he had nothing on his mind and wanted a rest. The lady sat quite still, and pale ; but her beautiful eyes kept wandering round from one to another, like some pretty creature caught in a trap. Doctor Bernstein � he was a foreign gentleman of some sort, a German, we heard tell� it had been hard lines on him to keep quiet all this time. He couldn't hold it in no longer. ' Good heafens ! ' he says, 'are you men, and will not say nodings when yon baf such an ower as dis ? Subbose you sbood us all, what then? Will not the whole coundry rice and hund you down like mat docks f ' 'That won't make it any better for you, mate,' says Moran, with a grin. ' When you and he's lying under that old tree outside, it'll make no odds to yer whether our rope's a long or a short 'un-' *? Quite right, Moran,' says Mr. Knightley. ' Doctor, be has you there.' Starlight moved a step or two over towards him, as if lie was uncertain in his mind. Then he Bays to Wall and Hulbert, ' See here, men,' you've heard what Moran says, and what I think. Which are you going to do ? To help in a brutal, cowardly murder, and never be able to look a man in the face again, or to take this money to-morrow ? A hundred and seventy each in notes, mind, and get away quietly, or are you going to be led by Moran, and told what you are to do like children?' ' Oh ! come, Dan, let's take the stuff,' says Wall. ' I think it's good enough. What's tho use of being contrary. I think the Captain's right. He knows a dashed sight more than us.' ' He be hanged !' says Moran, with his eyes glaring and the whole of his face working like a man in a fit. ' He's no Captain of mine, and never was. I'll never stir from here till I have payment in blood for Daly's life. We may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I've sworn to have that man's life to-night, and have it I will.' 'You'll have ours first, you bloodthirsty, murdering dog,' says Starlight; and, as he spoke, he slipped his revolver into Mr. Knigbtley's hand, who covered Moran that moment. I drew mine, too, and had Wall under aim. Starlight's repeating rifle was up like lightning. Mrs. Knightley covered her even, the old woman screamed, and the Doctor Bat down on a chair and puffed away at his meerschaum pipe. 'We're three to three, now,' says Starlight; 'you've only to move a finger and you're a dead man. Wall and Hulbert can have a band in it if they havn't had shooting enough for one evening. Do your worst, you black-hearted brute ! I've two minds to take you and run you in myself, if it's only to give yon a lesson in manners.' Woran's face grew as black as an ironbarfc tree after a bush fire. He raised his revolver, and in one second we should have been in the middle of a desperate handto hand fight; and God knows how it might have ended hadn't Hulbert struck up his arm, and spoke out like a man. ' It's no use, Dan, we won't stand it. You're a dashed fool, and want to spoil everything for a bit of temper. We'll take the notes, and let Mrs. Knightley and the Doctor clear out out for Bathurst, if you'll say, honour bright, that you'll te at the Black Stump by to-morrow evening at 5, and won't give the police the office.' Moran, slow and eulky, put down his hand, and but glared round like a dingo with the dogs round him� as if he did'nt know which to snap at first. Then he looted at Mr. Knightley, wiih a look of hellish rage and spite, that ten devils couldn't have improved upon, and throwing himself down on a chair drank off half a tumbler of brandy. ' Settle it among yourselves and be d� djto you,' he eaid. ' You're are all agin me now, but, by ? , I'll be square with some of ye yet.' It was all over now. Mr. Knightley took a match out of the silver matchbox at his waicbchain, and lit another cigar. I saw the tears trickling through Mrs. Knightley's fingers. Then Bhe turned away her head, and, after a minute or two, was as calm and quiet as ever. ' You know your way about the place, Wall,' says Mr. JTnigbtley, as if he was in his own house, just the same aa usual� 'run up the horses, there's a good fellow ; they're in the little horse paddock ; Mrs. Knightley' e is a gray, and the Doctor's is a mouse ?coloured mare with a short tail, yea 

 can't mistake them. The sooner they're off the sooner vou'll handle the cash.' Wall looked rather amused, but went out, and we heard him rattle off to go lound the paddock. The Doctor went upstairs, and buckled on a long-necked pair of old-fashioned spurs, and Mrs. Knightley walked away like a woman in a dream, to her own room, and soon afterwards returned in her riding-habit and hat. I. foraged about and found the side-saddle 'and bridle in the harness-room. Everything was in tip-top order there �glass slides for keeping the dust off the four-in-hand harness, and all that kind of thing. All the bits and stirrup-irons like silver. There wasn't much time lost in We watched pretty close lest Moran should take a new fancy into his head, but he stuck to the brandy bottle, and very toon put himself from fighting or anything else. I was'nt c orry to see it. I was well aware he was as treacherous as a dingo, and could sham dead or anything else to gain hi* ends and throw people off their guards. r Well, the horses were brought out, and when Mr. Knightley lifted his wife up on to her saddle on the high crested gray, thoroughbred with a dash of Arab blood from an old Satellite strain, I guess he was never better pleased with anything in the world. They looked in each other's eyes for a minute, and then the old horse started off along the road to Bathurst with bis fast, springy walk. Starlight took off his bat and bowed low in the most respectful way. Mrs. Knightley turned in her saddle and tried to say some thing, but the words wouldn't come � she could only wave her hand � and then her head went down nearly to her caddie. The Doctor scrambled on to his back, and trotted off after her. The gray moved off, shaking his head, at a beautiful, easy springy, canter. We raised a cheer, and they swept round a corner of the road and out of sight. 'You'll find these rather good, Captain,' says Mr. Knightley, handing Starlight his cigar-case. 'There's a box upstairs in my drcsrinjj-rooin. If you'll allow me, I'll order in dinner. There ought to be something decent if my old cook hasn't bec-n frightened out of his life, but I think be has seen too much to be put out of his way by a little ? ubooting.' ' Now I think of it,' says Starlight, ' I do really feel disposed for refreshment. 1 say, Wall, see if you can't get that ferocious friend of yours into a roam where he can sleep off his liquor. I 'really must apologise for his bad manners ; but you see how the case stands.' 'Perfectly, my dear fellow,' says Mr. Knightley. ' Don't mention it. I shall always feel personally indebted to yon, for far more than I can express. But let that pass for the present. What shall we do to pass the evening V You play picquet, and hazard of course.' ' Do I not,' Eays Starlight, his eyes lighting up in a way I didn't remember. ' It's many a day since I've met with any one near my old form.' 'Then suppose we have a game or two,' BayB Mr. Knightlev, ' after dinner or supper, whichever we choose to call it. f have cards ; they luckily came up the other day. In the meanwhile you will find the claret very fair, and this cold wild turkey� I 6hot, a brace last Thursday� is not to be despised.' We had a rattling good feed, and no mistake, whatever it was. The turkey was a grand bird, and weighed 211bs., he told us. The cook had sent in some hot potatoes, and chaps like us that had been riding, walking, and fighting for 20 hours, right on end, had just the sort of appetite that a bird of that kind deserved. He was as fat as butter too. They feed on dandelion seeds at that time of year. _ It gives 'em a sort of gamy flavour, such as no other bird, wild or tame, has. To my liking, the wild turkey beats the black duck even. He's the best game bird that flies in the bush. Mr. Knightley too, now his wife was Bafe on her way to Bathurst, and things seemed going well, was full of fun, ard kept us all going. He helped everybody twice over, and wouldn't hear of any one keeping the bottle standing. The night was close rather, and we were all that thirsty it went down like mother's urilk. 'Wall and Hulbert got pleasant enough and joined in, now that Moran waB out of the way. He was snoring in a back room, and, like a man in the 'dead-house of a bush shanty, not likely to wake before sunrise. Mr. Knightley told us some out-and-out good yarns, and Hulbert and Wall swore that if they'd known he was such a good sort, they'd never have thought of sticking up the place. He said he had been quite mis taken about them, and that another time he should know better than to volunteer for work that was not part of his du f y. By that time the claret had gone round pretty often ; and without being screwed, we'd all had oar tongues loosened a bit. After that we lit our pipes, and we three began to play all fours and euchre, sometimes one pair, sometimes another. As for Mr. Knightley and Starlight they got out a curious filagree sort of a little card-table and began to play some outlandish game that I didn't know, and to look very serious over it. They had notes for counters, and 1 could see, as I looked over every now and then, that each man was doing all he knew to best the other. Sometimes one had the show, some times the other. We got tired and had another smoke and turned in. The beds were snug and comfortable. Mr. Knightley showed us where to go, and we wanted a good night's rest bad enough. Just before I turned in I went up to the table. They looked as keen at it as if they'd just began, and I heard Starlight say, ?? I owe you 100 now. I'll play you double or quits.' So I left them to it. I could eee they were not on for bed just then. Both men were cool enough, but I could see that Starlight (and I'd never known him touch a card before) was one of those men that would never rise from the table as long as he had a shilling left, and would stake everything he had in the world upon the torn of a card. We all slept sound, but most of us were up at sunrise. It doesn't do for chaps in our line to be caught napping, and the police might have got wind of where we were at work. We had our horses to look to, and to give a look round in a general way to see if things were right. Starlight and Mr. Knightley didn't turn out, they'took it easy, perhaps they'd been up later than us ; anyhow, they didn't show till breakfast, when they both made pretty fair time over the eatables. My word ! it was a breakfast, though we'd got a bit tired waiting for it. The old cook had hashed up the turkey, it was stunning, almost better than the day before. Then bacon and eggs, grilled steak, fresh bread and butter, coffee and tea, watercresses. Really 1 thought we never should stop. It was lucky the police didn't come, or we shouldn't have done much in the fighting line, or the runaway either. As it turned out Sir Ferdinand wasn't so very far off the line, but he took another road. He never had any luck Eomehow in following us up, though he had some first-rate chances. Moran was off his feed, and wouldn't come in. He took a nip and walked down to the creek. We were all glad enough to get ehut of him. After breakfast and a turn round the stables, blest if Starlight and Mr. Knightly didn't have out the cards again, and at it they went as fresh and keen as ever. We didn't know what in the world to do with ourselves till it waB time to start to ride out to the Black Stump, where we were to meet the] Doctor and collar the 500 notes. They didn't waste a minute of their time, till about half-past 12. , Starlight puts down his cards very gently, and says he,. ' I'm afraid we have no more time to epare. I've enjoyed, the play more than I have done anything for years. I leave you 100 now in notes, and you must take my I. O. U. for the balance. What bank shall I pay it into ?r- 'The Australian,' saya Mr. Knightley. 'At your convenience, of course.' ' Within a month,' eays Starlight,' bowing, 'and now a glass of wine and a biscuit, it's time to be off.' - We had something as good, nearer the mark than that, and Moran sat down too, and played a {rood knife and fork. He'd come too, after his booze, and was ready for any fresh villainy as usual. He didn't let on to be nasty, but he looked sulky enough, and I saw his eye fixed en Mr. Knightley and Starlight now and then as if he'd have given a good deal to have had them where they hadn't so many at their backs.
