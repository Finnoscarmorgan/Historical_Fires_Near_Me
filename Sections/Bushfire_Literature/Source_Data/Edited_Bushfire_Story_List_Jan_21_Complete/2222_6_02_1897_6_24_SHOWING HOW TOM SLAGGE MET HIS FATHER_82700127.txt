THE BLACK FORTY. A Story of Early Australia. 

 CHAPTER XXV. SHOWING HOW TOM SLAGGE MET HIS FATHER.  The smoke from the bush fires had grown so thick in the clearing around the hut that, before it was actually dark, those 

 inside could scarcelly distinguish the figures moving in the scrub. Several shots were fired on both sides, and although those in authority endeavoured to restrain the impetuosity to the attacking party, they could not quite keep them under control, so infuriated were they with the occupants of the house. " We might make a rush for it directly," said Wilson, " the haze ie very thick." " And get pinked for a certainty," chimed in Barrett. " If we could only manage to cross the clearing it might be done." 

 " Of course. But will you show any of us the road ?" "Can't we use the dummy ?" " We might do so soon. At any rate it is worth trying an soon us it gets dark." The fire will draw them all off soon. You can feel it now." " It will draw us off with it, I'm afraid," said Miller. " We can get through it." " Yes, and be roasted to death ? Now what the devil are they up to now ?" The remark was occassioned by a movement being made amongst the men on the northern side of the clearing, where they were evidently massing together for some purpose. " They are consulting together," said Simpson. " The fire is being blown over the tree-tops by the hot wind, and it is likely to be a source of danger to them as well as ourselves." " They will have to raise tbe siege soon." " And we ?" " Make a smash for it." " Which way ?" " Right through it. I'm on anyway," said Smithers. " It's better than being taken to Sydney to be hanged." " We have a chance there." " A poor one. A Norfolk Island sort of a chance under old Price." " It's getting very dark." " Yes. They are talking about us again." Dennison called to them from the thicket. Simpson answered bis call. " Miller," he said, " we know you are there. It would be better for you to give yourselves 

 up to us." " There isn't any Miller here," returned Simpson. " We know different. I bave a very urgent reason for what I say." " Of course you have. But don't think we are fools." " Miller knows me well enougb. I need not explain to him what I mean. You come out whilst there is time. Your lives -" The remainder of the sentence was cut short in a very premptory manner. Whilst speaking, Dennison exposed himself for a second and a bullet fired by Barrett's steady band took off his hat. " Come away, Tom," said Gibson. " Don't waste your breath on such meat. The fire will do for them safe enough and our boys will never leave them." Shots were now being rapidly exchanged between the attacking party and those inside the hut. Several slight scratches were received from bullets which found their way through the window and chinks in the walls. One marksman repeatedly fired in at the window, and his aim was so sure that those inside had to lie very cIose to the floor to escape being wounded. Some of the shots came from above, one of the men having climbed a tree with the object of firing into the hut, so as to cover the floor. With a shriek of pain Simpson threw down his rifle and fell upon tbe floor, his bead hanging over the pit, which was being deepened by Wilson, who was taking bis turn at digging. " Got a touch ?" asked Smithers. 

 Simpson groaned aloud. " My leg is gone," be gasped. " That infernal mongrel in tbe tree has done the damage." " If 1 draw a bead upon him," said Barrett, " he'll not repeat the dose. But let me look. It may only be a flesh wound." It was more than that. The ball had entered the skin just below the knee, and striking the bone with terrific force and apparently shattered the leg, for when touched the most excruciating pain resulted. " I'll bandage you," continued the hunter, " so that you won't feel it. You will have to find your pins soon though, I can tell you." The preacher cursed and blasphemed in the intensity of his agony, as he lay upon tbe boards writhing in pain. " Don't touch me," be cried. I'm done for, I know I'm done for. Oh, let me alone. Don't leave me like a dog to die here." " Nobody's going to leave you. Let me look at it." " I know you are. You are a treacherous lot, and would desert a pal in his trouble." " Oh stow your gab. I tell you we are all in it together. We've got to fight now or get away somehow. What are you up to, Miller ?" " Trying a bit of a dodge. You fellows keep well to the front of the hut. I'm going to see if the coast is clear this way." He shifted the sliding panel as he spoke and looked out. It was comparatively dark out that way, the shadow of the hut being cast across the opening. There were no fires lighted there and apparently there was liltle watch kept. The lines of Harris shone like threads of silver against the 

 blackness which surrounded them, and Miller putting his hand upon them, worked them to and fro with the object of atttacting attention. No notice was taken of it apparently. Then a sudden idea seized him and he picked up the dummy figure and thrust it outside. Still there was no movement made by the attackers. Then he attached it to the end of the lines, and by pulling upon the other end drew it slowly away from the wall of the hut. It resembled a man crawling on his stomach from the house, to the thicket. Right across the opening he droew the figure slowly and steadily. It had reached within six feet of the log to which the lines were fastened when a cry from the bushes told Miller it had been seen. Several shots flashed almost simultaneously from the scrub, and the figure , struck in many places, rolled over. The next instant a number of dark forms were seen hurrying in that direction. Miller glanced back. Simpson groaned, and cursed, and screamed as he lay there upon the floor. Barrett was kneeling beside him endeavouring to bandage up the wound. With a swift movement he closed the panel and crouched under the shadow of the wall. The fire was rapidly nearing them, and in another minute, apparently, the place would be as light as day. Belter to take the chance of being shot than to fall into their hands. How could they hope to hold out ? They would be roasted alive soon. As for the tunnel, well that was not six feet deep yet and it was folly to suppose that they could ever hope to drive twenty yards like that. Why even working in pairs they could never do it. So he would chance it. He noticed that the attention of the besiegers was concentrated upon the dummy figure which they had fired at, and at one point where the shadow of the hut reached quite up to a heavy tree butt, which jutted out from the undergrowth there was every chance of a getaway. He stole softly off from the wall, and crawling like a serpent, sheltered himself behind a grass tussock for a moment and then on. No one saw him evidently, for he moved on unnoticed until he reached the log, where he paused again, and the next moment he was safely inside the shadow of the scrub. He could distinctly hear the groans and blasphemy of the wounded man in the hut and the voices of the members of the attacking party as they called to each other 

 while moving about in in there timber. There was no-one at his side at all. Like a shadow be glided from tree to tree, the friendly darkness shadowing him from observation. The wind roared in the trees above him, a perfect hurricane, and all around tbe branches cracked and snapped and crashed. There was danger abroad in the forest, but it was nothing to the danger of the gallows noose which hung over the hut. He would leave them to take care of themselves. No fear of any of them ever troubling him any more. They were safe for eternity, or Cockatoo, and either one was as bad as the other. Now, if he could but clear their circle he would be all right. It was no distance across to Ford's, and there he knew he would find no one to oppose him. How the wind roared to be sure ! A myriad of large blazing sparks were caught up aud whirled around him until he seemed to be stalking through fire itself. Ah ! what was that ? Someone moving close ahead surely. The smoke was so dense that he could scarcely see a yard, and at intervals as the wind, struck downwards through the trees, it blew the smoke aside and the air was quite cool and clear. There was a small cleared opening, where a tree bad fallen some years before, dragging with it the smaller underwood and giant limbs of other huge forest monarchs, and Miller was compelled to cross this. He could not go round it, as he knew that he would be certain to ba seen, aud that meant death. He waited until the smoke-cloud became a little denser, and then ventured out. If he could cross he would be safe. He lelt rather than knew that there was someone close by who was watching his movements. He had better be still awhile, but get across he must. Now then. He was already half way over, when he was called upon to stand. It was not so much the imperative manner of the person speaking which drew him up so suddenly, as the tone of the voice. It was as though he himself had spoken, calling aloud against the roaring of the wind. Instinctively he turned, and seeing a figure approaching in the gloom, his sense of self-preservation took over and he turned and ran. " Stop ! stop !" cried the voice again. " Stop or I will fire at you." In a moment Miller ducked and fell, just as the pistol flashed within three yards of him. He rose to his feet and made off into the smoke, a second bullet passing close by his head. Running at full speed, he paid little attention to this, being only too anxious to get away. He was in the scrub now and out again into a second opening. Again the voice called upon him to stop, he felt for a weapon, but found that in his hurry to escape he had left his pistols and his rifle behind him in tbe but. He would chance a personal encounter with his pursuer, he knew that the others were too intent upon watching the hut to be as far back in the bush as he was, and he could rely upon his 

 great strength aad activity to master this party, whoever he was. He stopped dead in his tracks at the second call and held up his hands. He did so for several reasons. One was to throw his pursuer off his guard, and another was that he was in a better position for a hand to hand encounter. Again the smoke lifted, and now the roar of the wind was blended with the roar of the flames, as the fire caught the trees above and below. A large piece of brushwood which had dried during the heat of the day was set on fire by a falling spark, and being caught by a gust of the furnace blast, in a moment crackled and ran up into a mass ot flame twenty feet high. Then the smoke-veil was drawn aside, and Miller turning, met his antagonist advancing toward him with an out-stretched arm holding a pistol. " Don't shoot, don't shoot," said Miller, " I give up. I give up." " Come this way then." Miller advanced a pace, made a pretence to stumble, aud was upon his foe, in a second. And thus father met son for the first time in their lives, in a struggle. to the death Miller was a powerful man and was skilled in athletic exercises. He felt for the throat of his adversary, but before he could take a hold he was himself seized in a very pronounced fashion and almost overpowered. The two men fell together upon the ground, struggled to their feet, and separated. Not a word was spoken, as instinctively they closed again, Miller made no attempt to escape, for his blood was up now, and he was determined to beat this fellow whoever he was. Over and over on the ground they rolled, each striving for an advantage over the other, until they rose to their feet once more by the side of the burning bush. Then they grappled again whilst the heat of the fire burned and scorched their faces and their clothes as they fought. And as they faced each other in the light of the fire, young Thomas Slagge, looking into the eyes of his opponent, saw and recognised his father. Like a flash it came back to him the warnings 

 he had received to stay at home, the words of the artist detective at Ford's and the many circumstances surrounding the fact that his father was alive. Yes, there he was before him in the flesh, Trolly Miller, the notorious bushranger � the Flying Doe. So terrible was the realisation of this knowledge that Tom fell back in horror, his finger pointing straight into the face of the other and his tongue refusing to gasp out the words he vainly strove to utter. " Oh God," he called out at last. " Oh spare me this, oh my fattier !" But that man, dazed and blinded with passion, heard nothing as the words were drowned in the noise of the hell raging above and about them, and he sprang again upon the lad, bearing down his body with his weight upon the earth. And as they fell Miller caught hold of a strong piece of a branch which was burned off in the fire, on the very edge of which they struggled, and struck the boy a crushing blow over the head with it. He held out his arms in mute supplication for mercy as he rose to his feet, but Miller struck him down upon his knees. There was a loud cry from the edge of the clearing close by, and three figures sprang into view. One was old Thomas Dennison, and in his company were Hobson aud the black boy. Miller saw his danger, and was turning to flee when his madness � that fierce passion which had so often ran him into danger - that madness blinded even his instinct to escape and he raised his bludgeon in both hands to strike down his son. " Stop, stop," cried Dennison, rushing forward. " For the love of God Slagge stop ! You do not know what you are doing � oh heaven !" For the club fell upon the upturned, appealing face of the lad� a heavy blow� and he sank forward upon the grass. " Father !" he gasped, and lay quite still. Then came the roar of the furnace blast again, and the flames and sparks were blown upon them in a blinding whirlwind as Miller with a wild laugh of exultation, rejoicing in the damnable act which even an offended God did not out-stretch his hand to prevent, sprang right into the fire and disappeared in the smoke.
