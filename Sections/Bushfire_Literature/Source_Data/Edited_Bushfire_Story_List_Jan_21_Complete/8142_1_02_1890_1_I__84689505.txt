HIOW JACK LI67111 I1.s5 L s CIIIIISTIIAS I11\\ ;IND HOW lIE FOINI . */ (Bv J.4, / CIlAPTIL I Christmas E?', rila at and sultry one; a crowd of ar'n, lung, middlc aged and old, all mottce , arnd most of them leading pack Ior? , are trooping round at the door! i he travellers' Ilest---the one inn of Ih little township of Never, far away of the Gippsland bills. They are shealsre who have that nmorning received their cr etlos at Pon jiwonji station, the het cl ed they have worked at on a long rou lt and are now bound for their retfeet ?oa homes. Of course the horses are sti hung up, and a rush for the bar t hn l place, for a longish ride in a blu?ing s on a dusty road has made all lthirst. 'he younger portion mostly sffect rob stuff--hop beer, shandygahF, stc.-whi the seniors prefer Ihard ncl i.e., wl sky, brandy and rum. The question (when the first drought is appeased is, who is going on ? An th part is a good deal divided in opiart on o he subject. One tall, hands m joung' fellow, thre beau ideal of a ippi and native, who hasa been unco mo y irritable and fidety for the +as t n days, starts up and declares that o who will he medn to hbe at hfyrtl Flat lor dinner on rbo morrow. "Nonsense I Im ssible l! Absurd ! Whys its 90 trilos! Yon're mad l are the exclsnution utterdl by his compdnions; aitl oreo steady-going arry Benson, :o whtbm Jaek Litton has pore particarly a?ldrested himself, 0ooh0iioolie s( 'hdttion'. I l "It can'Dt be done, Jack?, * y boy, though I know bow anxious you are to get Ihone to-morrow, and Irshould like vary well to do so, too, but we must both hb content to get in irn ime for the Boxin4 Day sports, and that will be good work for tIe horses.' i 'I ,t11 you it can and sha be done," said J bk Litton impatient . " Tom HIrst, thb boadnary ride at Ponji wqjl, ?old me of a track y which I ca. sare more lthan 8 mies, and old A?nt ally is as fit as a ddle, and I mdan td try it. You turn ,hp Caroline Caek to the old reef, then ip a spur on tolltt main divide, and fillow that all the dtsy till youadrop down it the head of Isfrtle Flat, about 15 miles from Bomea "Won't you come whit me, old 

 fellowl" lasry Benson shook his bend. "I don't like parting company, Jack, but I coulti't do it. . Aunt Sally may pull throu in the time, though it will be hard ork for her, baut my horses couldo' stand it, and thit New Eng land cot of yours will knock up. I've heard f that track. ; It's terribly rough, 4nd not a drop of water from the Caroliu till you get on the Flat, fully 30 mil , and it's nearly 4 o'clock now. I wish you would give up the notion, and cohe round with me. It will be a beastly ride, and what does a day matter ?" "A good deal to me, " replied Jack. "You ought to know-it's mother's birthday as well as being Christmas and I've never been from home on that day since I was born. 'I wrote and told her I'd be hone in time, and she'd fret her heart out if I didn't keep my word. So go I will." While this collquy took place be tween the friends the rest of the party were making their own arrangements. The majority deeded to go on to Harris's, twenty mic further on their road, while a few of the older hands, who had rapidly iado up for their en forced obstinence while at the shed, de termined to stop ohere they were Ior the night. 

 " Harry," said Jack, " I'll get you to take the chestnut ilt with my swag round with you, anl I'll fill my water bag and take somen biicuits and cheese, and I'lldo first ratoe' Jack proceeded rt make the prepara tions he spoke of, nad ate a hasty snack before starting on Iis arduous journey, and his friend quietly placed a small bottle into the pouch that held the pro visions. ; " You may be g ,d of it before you got through," obs ed Harry, when the other remonstra d. " I only wish you'd let it alone, Lhis mad notion of yours, or thadt I could keep with you." Harry an ack had been friends and companions from chilh.ood, their parents being, near qeiglbors, but the former was tile senior by about five years. A square built, :powerfel young man, with close'mroppe lhed and bushy beard of dark brown, lo had a somewhat grave and thougt lul look, and, though fairly Ihandsome, ns at a isadvantage beside his younger ato. Jack's 6 feet I inch in heightt ltk the actual breadth off his shouldere and the muscular do valopment mo his lithe limbs, while his curly blacl hair, dark.blue eyes and fresh cnmltianion, wi, h a saucy, devil. may.caro ecpression, made hiom very at tractive in pppearanee. lIe was only 20, and tlid had been his first shearing tour, whibi it wae IIarry Benson's fourth. 

 Ct Cane, lads, have a glass witll me, and tlhi l'm off," cried Litton gaily. " I'll be h Ino to the Flat and tell them you're all song tlh road." And wih hearty hand-shakes, and mutnalgod wishes, he mounted Aunt Sally, aol allowed by a ringing cheer Jnck b1tm cantered briskly away down tt ot, dusty road. Thongt to left the inn with a dash, Jack Lit ot hand far too much judgment to travel fr at such a pace, and very noon po!b Jhisa mare into a standy walk, turning the Caroline Creek where the lomai rad crossed it. For nomo fifteen i he followed an old worn track ths t one time hadl had a good deal of t?i o upon it, but was now but little usd. Now on one aide of the creek, na+oi the other, crossing back wards altlforwards, now keeping close to the Pttd's edge, and again going 

 over some steep spur, upwards and still upward the road went. Here and there were traces of recent fassicking, and a but niow and then showed that a few miners still lingered on it, but practically the Caroline had beeri abandoned, when the.reoof so named had burst up. The afternoon was close and hot; and for the most part shiit in among high and steop hills, thiers was but little air stirring. But still he pslhed briskly forward. A word now as to Aunt Sally, as she plays an important part in our history. Barely 15 hands high, at the first glance ohe appears unequal to the task of carrying so tall and muscular a rider. But mark the grand set of the shoulders, the deep girth and powerful quarters, supported on short, flat, clean legs and unexceptionable hoofs, and" there is plenty of evidence of her weight-enrrying abilities, while the game head, with its full bright eyes, well carried on a mus cular neck, tells of the good blood that floaws in her veins, though her pedigree caniot be traced for more than two generations with any certainty. , Dark brown, almost black in color, with tan muzzle and' a small star, she was as good a specimen of the Gippsland stock horse as her master was of the youth of the district. She had been foaled at Litton's home twelve years before, and for the last six had carried Jack over every kind of country without a mistake. At last, as the shadows of evening were closing round them, Jack and his mare reached the deserted workings of the once popular Caroline; the buildings fallen to decay, and the larger pieces of timber standing up, gaunt and grin as skeletons. Wheeling round the buck of the old claim, Jack faced Aunt Sally at the last and steepest spur yet en countered. The gallant little mare mounted the pinch with quick, eager steps and occasional snorts, and emerged from the gloom of the creek into the full light of the setting sun. The general direction our hero was pursuing was to tihe south-west, and though there were abrupt turns to all points ol tihe compass, the main course had been well preserved. Arrived on the main ridge, or divide, between two distinct watersheds, Jack pulled up for a few minutes to give Aunt Sally her wind, and to take note of the country before him. Like the backbone of some gigantic snake, the divide stretched before him for miles, while spurs, answering to ribs, shot down on either side, with deep precipitous gullies be ï¿½ . ^... ,t ... .. i r .... Ih~ . . n~.....1, 

 each the timbered hills lay like the dark green billows of a troubled sea. No sign of human occupation was ;isible anywhere; no track even could be distinguished on that bare and rocky idge, though a half-obliterated blaze night be descerued here and there on he trees. As he had ascended from the twilight of the north-eastern side of the divide into the light of the setting nun, so now also he met a south-west wind blowing short, sharp gusts, but not cool and refreshing; hot and tainted with smoke, it seemed to blow from the mouth of the furnace, and the dull red haze in which the sun was sink. ing told of distant bush fires. "A bad look out for us, old girl," said Jack, as he re-mounted his mare. " I didn't think of this when I started. We're going into an ugly country to be caught in a bush fire, but we can't turn back new, so go along my pet, and get through it as fast as you can." Aunt Sally tossed her pretty head and steppel gaily on, picking her way with cat-li;e activity over rocks and fallen timber, now jumping a log that crossed the track, and now scrambling round the head or butt of some fallen giant, but still making good progress. The sun faded and a young moon threw a faint light over the scene, and mile after mile was covered, and still, as they advanced, the smoke-laden wind blew stronger, and tihe dull red glow on h. hnr;,?i, inerwaerd. 

 "TThis fire's a boomer," thought Jack. " I shall have to look out pretty sharp to ;et through it safe. But it can't be hlcped now." A peak rising up above the rest of the hills of his route now loomed large against thered background, and he re cognised it by the description given him as theNight Cap, a land mark on his course, ?bout Ialf-way between the little towroip of Never and Myrtle Flat, and Io pushed on to gain its cum mit and srPey the country beyond. A good deal very rough ground had to be traverst!, for the gullies bit deep into the rilge at that part, and its crest eniemgged about, doubling the distance toltle point of observation, and the smoke mnce more heavily on the in creasing cw:J, and the light became brighter, atn a sound like distant surf could be distoguished as he adranced. Jack and It, lire were rapidly nearing each other. At last the panting mare gained the ?'.p of the peak, and Jack again ehaltdc to look around and see what courslhe should take. The fire nas raging tiong the southern side of the divide, cntd advancing rapidly, spreading frob spur to gully and gully to spur, will fresh bursts of flame, as grass and kh:ub flared suddenly, with sharp erackllr1 sounds, and then burnt more steadilyj n the heavy dead. timber that enctmltoed the ground, or roared up the hol?ur trunk of some dead, standing tre. It was a terrible pros pect. A reg?or era of fire lay before eim and to:is left. He turned his gaze back on tihe road lie had come, and calculate: how long it would take himt I. retrace his steps, and whethedr he could outstrip the advancin fire, acl fedt that the clnnces weret cidedly against his do ing so, the sr escitess of the road giving the flames, ich overleaped all ob stacles, a drea !l advantage. Even as he stared wild round he noted that the fire had taket fold in the gullies lead ing up to th ridge behind him, and that his rtret was virtually cut off. There only ra ied the northern side of the divi t turn to, and that was 

 an unknown 'and almost untroddon wilderness, a tangle of spurs and gullies, from, which it would be difficult to ex tricato himself, even if the fire did not follow him into its recesses. However, it wosn the only course op?: to him to escape the terrible peril that threatened him, .and observing one spur that seemed cleaorer of scrub and timber, and a little less precipitous than the rest, heo turned his willing beast towards it, with but faint hopes of escaping tlhe impend ing danger.
