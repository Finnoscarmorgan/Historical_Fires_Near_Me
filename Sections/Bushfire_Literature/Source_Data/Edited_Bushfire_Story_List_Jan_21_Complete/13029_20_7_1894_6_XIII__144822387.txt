Before die had time to think of her position, tfie bushranger, Tom War ren, rqde his horse to her side. He raised his nat,in trae Parisian fashion as he desired to. appear in his best style, especially now, Tvithauohan opportunity. ' What a delightful meeting,' he said. I fun pleased to see you, 11 iss. Hora/ '.Sir, Warren,' die replied'; ' you may think it peculiar, but I hoped to meet my friends without seeing anyone , else.' ' That is strange,' he said; ' I should have thought you would rather have met people.' 'Perhaps it might have been better,' she said. v ? ' flora, you know how often I have tried to say a word to you,' he said. ' Your in fluence has made me so different. I have expelled from my mind all further communi cation with my former acquaintances, and fully intend tliat the future 'hall be devoid of evil doings. I was never, very bad; and, Flora, the whole aim of .my life will be to. gain your confidence, and by my' conduat I hope in time to oonqueiLall your prejudices, Do you'know, Flora, 1 was arrogant enough to presume that l held a place rjn yonr es teem, more than mere friendship ; and; that you would some day be my 'wife.' ' Tbat i8 suite sufficient, Mr. . Warren,' sh^ replied, in an angTv tone. ' Good morning.' Ag her lijrht ridxnjf whip tci^chcd th� hprse, Warren c^ight tbe bridle rdns. ' Rora/ he faid.' Wait a little while.; I do lovei you so inubh ; all I have shall' be fours.; Jam -sure your father ..-will favor me; am not a poor man', Flora ; I can command thousands � don't pjill e| way� but allow ine. to explain those raise 'charges against me that have made ine unwelcome to you.' 'Let my horse go,' Flora said. 'How dare you insult me-K . - She was greatly excited, urging her horse forward; and trying to loose the reins from - Warren's haad. A fresh jdea possessed' Warren, and with a sudden impulse 'he seized Miss Murphy, roujid the waist.: ' I'U take you where we can talk, when you are in a better humour. I can't wait,' he said; ' Desist immediately,' she';, called out, stacking him in the faoa, and struggling id release heiself. . Raising her oS the saddle with his power ful arm, he placed her in front of himself^ retaining hold of her horse's reins. Flora faiated, which facilitated the scheme of carrying her to a place a few miles distant, belonging to a cockatoo settler, onoe a mate of Warren's. He rode, bard, often brushing1 the trees whon turning angles, in the 'narrow road, where he had to exert the greatest skill to prevent the branches tearinghis precious bur den from his aims. Continuing at a maddening rate, down a gully, the horses took a flying leap across a ohasm, then up the opposite rise, uien along a flat piece of road, and around another sharp turn, with trees growing so olose to gether ttrat thqy prevented liim ; seeing an advancing horseman ;; riding almost as fast as himself. ' Save me ! save me !' Miss Murphy screamed. The single, horseman pulled up within a few strides after passing, and rode after the bushranger. ' Stop, for your life !' he called ; ' or I'll fire.' . ' Never,' W airen answered. ' Fire if you dar*.' Holding the' giri between them. ' A little .puff of smoke, from a revolver, and Horace Basdombe was riding beside Warren, and with the dexterity, only known to the back country tide*; snatched flora from lie other's grasp, Without ^resistance. Warren's spirit had fled. He had finished his last ride '; and his life in this world was ended. Basoombe held flora firmly and rode after the affrightened hones, with the body of Warren swaying to the motion of the ghastly gallop. Basoombe' s horse being comparatively fresh, _ in a few strides .- oiiughfap to -theim. Catching the bridles of /the horees^Il^ gninklB' brought ftem toagtandstlll. . - ' ' 'Minn tfnrnlir - ? -- - , rtooveredj and ^yjBiSiyipOT^iwnherfeet ; Basoombe f^Kneired an armful of ferns, from the adia Cent-;bush, 8nd formed an accommodating cushion for her to rest upon. Bnokling the bridles to a forked tree he went to examine the lifeless body of Tom Warren. He perceived the shot hod entered the back of his head; killing him instantly. ' It's all over now,' he said. ' Poor War ren, I remember we were friends, before bis unfortunate preference became manifest. He was a own with many of the acquire ments of a gentleman; but lost to all honor ; he had a fearless heart, but. was a mpral .coward ; indeed, a curious anomaly..' ;I ? lie next : ^brooeading on Baicombe's part, . was to take the body off the traok , and place it under a geebung bush, covering it with the broad leaves of the cabbage tree that he gathered. When this preliminary work was finished he tttuxned and sat beside.Miss M^arphy. . ' Floral fie iaid, Vhowdid^ this happen f I was-pSrliape too histy,- it is'' mi awful act/ 'I was going to Gisbourne,' Flora an-' swered ; 'as previously arranged, when ;'Warren met m6 near the Green- Swamp ; -after stalking a neat deal of nonsense, he suddenly snatohed me from 117 hone. The rest I.cannot remember, until I saw you rush past, and you know the remainder.' ' We must not dwell longer on this sad soenb,' Bai^ombe'said. ^Ira oomparativdy eari.Jr \\ an houre' fast ride, and we shall be at Gkboume ; we had better start, if tou feel strong enough to ^ndure the ^fatigue of a ?'GifaSt ... ' I amperfecll7 xtwtea, thanks,7 die said ; � the'shpek caused me to be rather faint.' - dajre say it did,' Basoombe answered; * you will be better away from here.' Walking to the horses they mounted, and after t-a faat . ride, arrived at their friend's ''atttum.': - lli��oUoe were infonned bf th6 details of -the meeting, ant Warren's '-untiinely end. An investigation was hdd at an hotel, both witnesses being present, whioh terminated in a veidibt of ' 'justifiable iKwnidde,' as War-' ren waa gazetted an outlaw. Basoombe in4us oourse was notified -that he wafe entitled to-the hundred 'pounds re W^.^M-)ili�,deolined. . V ; CHAPTER XSV, Curlew, wiiti the twu vther bnshrangen, returned by a circuitous route to their cave in the monntains, sadly depnesed in spintsj knowing that their position was more pre carious than previously. In all probabuity the tnjojpers would sooner or later disoover - their lotacat. - - - lagbting a fir^ the Ully -was wmtohed by ! one of thrnn, while the others were in search of a fat waBabv, lo satisfy IJiem ^fqr Ripper.

 . . ., 1 1 � ? ? : � : ' Tguessitwill^ie risky for us after this,7' Ben said. ' We can't remain here always, that's oer-. tain,' Huntingdon said. ' The Sydney side will be my dart.' The night passed without incident, and.the following morning Curlew saddled his horse, to proceed to the Hanging Bock. Bora Bora was not there, but Eowani said, that he would shortly return. Curlew re mained chatting with the lubra, who had not forgotten her intention of speedily re joining her tribe. ' Ball me like um camp,' she said ; ' ball me yabba long warringo, plenty tig moon.' ' You soon yan away P' Curlew said, ' by um by.' 'Plenty yan up hill 'bout 'ere,' she said. ' Ball me yarraman.' They wera talking long -enough to allow Curlew to have several smokes; 'mien, with out the slightest disturbance of the shrubbery fronting the cave, or the slightest sound, Bora Bora appeared before them. ' Me plenty patter, Master Budolph,' he said 4 ' you yan long me ?' ' What do you mean, Bora Bora,' Curlew said; 'you found money F' ' Ouay ! Master Buaolph,' he said, ' me track 'em whitefeller when you bin long way.' 1 1 thought you would,' Curlew said. ' To-morrow you show me long away track.' Bora Bora told - all he knew about the troopers, and the fight .behind the boulder rocks ; also, that he saw Curlew ; and, which was more interesting to Curlew, that Doug lass and Warren had gone towards Gis bourne. Curlew listened to all the black said, and did. Then saying that he would be with them to-morrow, he rode away in the direc tion of his own quarters. Ben and his mate had madethings nomfort ab'e ; the cave was swept olean, and an in viting eveningmeal prepared. _ A tsheerful feeling banished^that of depres sion. ? ? Curlew told them that which he hadrheard of Douglass and Warren, and said he might have more news to-morrow. - - The next day he visitedihe blacks. -Bora Bora said he was ready to gnide him along ^ the track, which led to where the' booty jwould be found. The hone was tethered to a sapling,' and he direoted the lubra to watch him carefully. '.dome along,' Curlew said, 'lead the wav.' They went throu^ht the bush, separating ithe bushes with their arms, as they pushed through the spreading branches. A good thing for Curie wthat he was an excellent bush- ; man, and a good runner, for the blackfellow kept at.a running pace, over hill and through scrub ; nothing was an obstacle to him. At length they found themselves overlooking a high perpendicular ravine. Bora Bora pointing to a round spur of the range, said that was the place. Walking along to the top of the rocks, they found an opening, and jumping from ledge to ledge, with the assistance of the trees, both reached the bottom. Crossing this the blackfellow quickly gained the top of the grassy ridge, where blue stone boulden lay scattered about, as though shaken from a huge .pepperbox, some being nearly hidden in the long wiry grass. Squatting in the inviting herbage, Bora. Bora motioned Curlew to do the same. ' Blackfellow big feller yan,' he said 1 'fore me find um boot track ; plenty day go long, gully, ball me find um boot track ; all track go bung, till one day go long this traok, me find where yarram bin standing ! plenty whitefeller tracks all 'boat ; me follow 'em up gully, and long a ridge 'ere; fellow 'em ' long a bit, what you call 'em � bonlda, then can see plenty boots, same like 'em money.� Come now. Master Budolph.' Jumping up, and starting at a slow run down the ridge, with Curlew following, often stepping^ onto fallen, .trunks: of. treea,- then oft again into holes, hidden by the thickly glowing oaten-eared grass, made by the stumps being buimt out during bush fires ; . at other times-;catohing his'legs:in the vines - trailing along1-' tile grounds-till at last he per ceived the blackfellow standing-under a group of trees. Quietly going to him, lie was shown impressions upon 'the ground, which the blackfellow said were horse'fl hoofs, bjit: too indistinct for Curlew to distinguish fli such. - -i '' ^^E^^^no^ee^eg^' B^raBpnt^Ti|-^(^ ^ -yarraman, look 'ere, long fello^ : blt^of bark, off join tail/ . '' And he held up a long horse-hair, that he had found. ' I think yon are right,' Curlew said. ' Now let me see where the money is.' 'All right, Master Budolph,' he said ; . ' yan long np on ridge, me see 'em traok, all way up, me show 'em you plenty.' The blackfellow again taking the lead went slowly, his face close to the ground, appearing at times undecided as if having lost the track ; 'but. tbe hesitation did not continue long, for he follo wed- Such wiRrh as he coiild see, often ' pointing out to Curlew the tracks as he said, of two whitefellows. The aboriginal has . peculiar eyesight:. A good traoker will follow traces, and see foot prints : when others could not peroeive the slightest mark, either of indentation ' or. of disturbed- twig of- stone. Stopping before an ordinary boulder, near an old fallen stringy bark tree,. Bora . Bora motioned with his waddy,� meaningt jt was the hiding place ; but again' Curlew did not' remark any peculiarity to denote .a differ ence. ' Go on,'. ha_said*r 1 where's theplant., ' All right, ' lie said, ''yerlook me pull . 'em | eaplin's.' . .. ..... ? '?* And he oommenqed- clearing away. the dead branches. Having' removed these,' lie rolled the boulder away� and, ihere lay exposed a hole full of go&andtBilvetrooin^: Curlew was more tiianTuiuuzed; anoi&odb- sciously looked about to see, if he were perP beived. Then kneeling, he began oountdng ithie coins. When iulof them were taken out, another surprise met his gaze; under. the money were disbovelfed seven o�amoiii l-ag's Containing theeo he estixn&ted. did not wdgh less than five pounds eaoh. 'Curlew deliberated a few. minutes, consid ering which would be the best plan to remove the rioh plant. He was not a man to wa*te time, finding the legal owner. Yean before when upon the dark green and evor blue waters of the roaring ocean, he had -been taught, .'Every man for himself,' and this was not the first opportunity of carrying his early precepts into practice. ' Yon make um glass nose bags,' he said, budgwy bag, no piooaniny holes, cany booty Jew a gunyah.' Bora Bora moved away to pull some stringy bark from the trunks, ani sat dbwn, busy in plaiting the flexible material into diape; hecanuueted thfee ordinary bags, or hand baskets, large'enough to oarry neatly all the gold and money. 1 Ci&lew placed the bags of gold jp t^e bas kets and the money that ooutd notlwpacke'l into the bags he distributed in his pockets. The black rolled the stone over the hole and proceeded towards the. high rocks, the' ?top of which after some difficult climbing was again readied;' they then continued walking a few miles until Cwiew noticed an ? admirable landmark, and a suitable plao* to d-3X*itthe valuable treasures, not far from the Uaoki^ camp. Ills being done, in half an hour they were at the cave. They were away neaiiy all day, walking oontiuually, . each having a good appetite. Howani slaced. a portion - of a inulaW upon the awes of the flre, vrith skin and hair on. ^ It was iiot long oozing, but' ?uffioiently so for-a fgunished bladdellow, that if, Just waimedt|brou^i ; ahdB-naBora �m in &0 hisjomahawk, wtounriewpreMniMhinu
