The Misfortunes of Beilby Boolger. 

 CHAPTER IX. 

 BY [?] 

 THERE were fresh tracks of natives, who had been fishing in a large sheet of water not far from the camp, and Leysid thought he would look to the watches in person during the night. 

 A few nights previously having found Arthurs asleop in a patch of long grass with his rifle for a pillow he had forthwith given him a '�caution" in the form of a good kick. On this night he heard Boolger, whose watch had ended, calling Arthurs to turn out, and supposing that Arthurs had so done Leysid fell asleep again. Immediately opposite the camp on the other side of the river was an island covered with low trees. Leysid awoke about 11 o'clock, and went out to see how the night looked, and whether the sentries were on guard. The camp fire was burning brightly, but no watchman was to be seen on that side. He then walked round the camp, and stood listening for the clink of the horse hobbles it had been thought advisable to remove the bells. He lit his pipe and sat down on a log. Suddenly he heard voices, from the bed of the river. " Oh, the lads have been round the horses," thought he, and paid little attention, only wondering that the voices did not come closer. Again he heard the voices. Thoro was no mistaking from whom the sounds came�darkies, and a number of them. The night was still, and he could hear several voices distinctly. He was on the point of arousing his men. It occurred to him that the niggers could not be aware of the presence of his party, as they were talking so unrestainedly ; if they meant mischief, a shower of spears would have probably been the first intimation of their proximity. While hesitating whether he should call the men or not, he bethought him of the unfaithful sentry, and was moving to question the other man as to when he had last soon Arthurs, when, as if by magic, up sprung eleven fires on the island in front of his position. He moved on cautiously, and stumbled over Arthurs, quite twenty yards from the camp, fast asleep in his former position. Leysid^* first impulse was to kick him into life, but he thought n, fright would have more effect, so, raising him by the collar of his coat, he shook him 113 a mastiff would a poodle. When the lad was thoroughly awakened he led him towards the river bank, and, pointing across, sai.l, "What is that?" Arthurs jumped off the ground�the sight had roused him fully�" Why it's niggers!" he exclaimed. 

 "Yes," said Leysid, "and you may thank God the river is between us and them, or you might not be quite so lively; more likely lying toes up with a spear through your heart. Ana what of us whose lives are depending on your watch fulness ? I have cautioned you once about this. If I ever find you asleep on your watch again it will be you and I for it. So take heed." Arthurs looked at the sturdy figure before him, and was silent. Doubtless the sable troop had seen the fire, but concluded it to be a stump burning, as may be seen for weeks after a bush fire. Leysid and Arthurs stood listening. They could distinguish the voices of women ana children, so were satisfied. The party were on a fishing expedition. When mischief is meant the encumbrances are left at home, or at a safe distance from the scene of the intended strife. Arthurs, in reply to some question of Leysid's, raised his voice rather incautiously, and the fires disappeared instantly. No more was heard of the blacks during the night; but Arthurs managed ever after to keep his eyes open. When day broke all the horses were missing �they had smelt the blacks and hastened to leave their neighbourhood, instinctively know ing there was enmity between them, though the blacks had not as yet acquired a taste for horseflesh, as their brethren on the Palmer did in later days. The missing beasts were found about five miles- back on the track by which they had come. When all was ready for starting, Leysid rode over to the island. Scoles and he followed the tracks�which were those of a large party�up the river bed, to the Brocken mountains. The country on that side not presenting a very inviting appearance, he followed the west bank down about four miles to a conical hill, underneath which there was a plain of con siderable extent having some waterholes on it, where Leysid determined to encamp for a time, and explore a distance ahead. Lambing time was not far distant, and, if he could find nothing better, where he was would answer. Leaving Scoles and Tom Burns with the stock, he took Arthurs, Boolger, and a man named Kelly with him. Their first stage was to the twenty mile crossing, a considerable time being occupied in searching the country each side. The tracks of alligators�l beg pardon of my honourable friend; well, crocodiles�but not the reptiles themselves were seen. The night passed in quiet. In the morning a horse named Lot was missing. He was one of the least troublesome, and had been selected on that account. Some time was spent in searching for him. The other horses had fed away from the river, sofe> one thought of looking there. Arthurs and Kelly were seeking Lot; Leysid and Boolger were at the camp. " The old horse might have gone down for a drink," said the latter. r<l will go and see." He went on foot, and found old Lot up to the shoulders in a quicksand�a not uncommon thing to meet with in sandy beds of rivers after a fresh. The old fellow had been struggling to extricate himself, but had only succeeded in churning the sand into spume. Boolger ran to the camp for a rope. When Leysid and he returned great was their astonishment to see poor Lot attacked by an alligator. The saurian had clawed a piece the size of a dinner plate from his right haunch. Lot, mad with pain and fright, made a tremen dous plunge and found footing for his fore feet, and with their assistance he reached firm ground, Leysid and Boolger meanwhile shout ing with all their might. The great lizard sur veyed them calmly, as if wondering what strange creatures those were, then scuttled away for the water at a fast pace. Lot went straight to the camp, where he stood bleeding badly. There were no means at hand of staunching it, but Leysid sewed the skin together with a palm and needle, put a lump of alluvial mud kneaded into paste on it, and though the wound had no other dressing, save to renew the mud as it caked off, it healed perfectly. Old Lot worked for many years after. Leysid was glad he had not brought his favourite dogs with him, the alli gators, or crocodiles, being very partial to the canine race, probably owing to the ease with which they could devour them at a gulp. When Kelly and Arthurs returned, and heard of Lot's escape, they were most anxious to interview the reptile, never having seen one of the tribe. Being assured that they would have frequent opportunities of making their acquaintance they were pacified. That day the party came to Pelican Creek. Leysid had heard of some likely country in that vicinity, and he resolved to stay for some days to look round. Leysid generally took Kelly with him, leaving Arthurs to see to the horses, and Boolger as camp-keeper, who kept them well supplied with duck and other wild fowl until the men loathed the sight of a feather so nice do we become in the midst of plenty� Boolger excepted. who had not forgotten the old bones in the schooner's hold. They had been camped there fora week, when one morning Ley sid's own riding horse was missing. Kelly wentto seek for him, and found the horse's trail going into the river bed, where he lost it. As the general direction had been up the river, Kelly followed on for about twelve miles. The sun was hot, and, as both he and the mare were thirsty, he resolved to have a drink, and perhaps a swim. He knew of an immense waterhole not far away, and into it he rode under the shade of a large ti-tree. He rode the mare in to the girths and allowed her to drink at her pleasure. The water was beauti fully clear and cool looking, and he thought what a glorious swim he would have presently, to be sure. First, however, he would have a smoke; he lit his pipe. The marc, approving of the coolness 01 her position, showed no in clination to move. Kelly grew contemplative: his thoughts travelled to his home and the gal he adored; he forgot all about his intended bath. A refreshing breeze came down the sheet of water. Kelly sat gazing round him in a dreamy ecstasy, from which a snort from the mare aroused him. Kelly looked down, think ing that the leeches were making free with the mare's legs. Great Jerusalem ! what was that fearful thing not a foot, as it seemed to him, from the mare's nose? In all his dreams nothing so hideous had presented itself: an ugly head, a pair of cruel-looking steely eyes. The saurian oj>cned his jaws, displaying an array of immense teeth and a cavernous mouth, whereon Kelly awoke from his stupor of amaze ment, wheeled the marc to the bank, and drove the spurs into her sides; but the mare seemed to be fascinated by the morister. It needed sundry applications of the steel and lashes of the stockwhip to get her started. He had not the faintest inkling of a desire for closer inspec tion ; he never drew bridle until the camp was reached. As soon as he came in sight he shouted, " Alligator ! alligator !" under the full belief that he was being chased. When the others heard the tramp 01 a horse at speed, one idea possessed them�tome one chased by 

 niggers; and they flew to arm�. What he was shouting could not be heard distinctly. Tho mare, panting, exhausted, covered with foam, stopped at the tent, and Kelly almost fell off, ana rolled on the ground, groaning as if in mortal pain. Seeing who the rider was�it was impossible to tell the colour of the horse �the party became a little assured, but, still under the impression that blacks were coming, in quired of Kelly how far off they were, how many of them, and so on. No reply could they get from Kelly�only moans and cries of "Oh ! the brute, Oh! the beast; I'm frightened to death." "Drench him with a bucket of water. Boolger," said Leysid. "Perhaps we shall then get a coherent answer from him." Under that treatment, in which Arthurs assisted with a second bucket, Kelly recovered. '' Now what is the matter?" inquired Arthurs. " How came you to ride the mare to death in this way?" " I saw an alligator." he replied. " So did Will and I, and Lot too to hia cost. What of that ? Where did you see him V "In the river." " In the creek, do you mean ?" "No, in the river/ "Why, we are ten miles from the river. Whereabouts in the river ?" "In the big waterhole at Flagstone Greek." "What!" roared Leysid in undisguised astonishment. " Oh! oh! I never saw such a baste. I come near falling into his ugly mouth." " Why, that place is twelve good miles from this. Do you mean to say that you rode at a gallop here because you saw an alligator? Nearly killed poor Bessy too. However, I do not think you will do it or a like trick in a hurry again. I will caution you at all events." Whereupon he administered such a thrashing with a stirrup-leather to Kelly that he rolled on the ground bellowing for mercy. " Get up, you brute, and sponge the mare. Put your own blankets on her. As the nights are cold you will no doubt repent your hasty action ere morning." Boolger had been shooting ducks down the creek, and when the alarm was given he hurried up expecting to hear that the camp was about to be attacked. Leysid was at work administer ing his caution. When Will heard the true state of the case he was just as angry as Leysid at the state the mare was in, Bessy being a great favourite. But they could not resist the fright ened look of Kelly, who as he recovered his equanimity seemed disposed to amplify on the horrid appearance of the brute, stating that the "hallygater" had chased him for some distance; that he could run almost as fast as the mare ; could roar like a bull, Ac. To all which the others turned a deaf ear. " Where is Sancho ?" said Leysid. " I never saw him, sir, at all/ "Sancho joined the other hones about an hour ago," said Will, "at the water." Leysid turned away in disgust, but Arthurs and Boolger tormented Kelly until he wished he had never heard the name of an alligator. They returned next day to the main camp. All hands set to work making yards and pre paring for lambing, and for the shearing which would follow in a couple of months. For some weeks they were so busyas not to have much tune for riding about. The presence of abori ginals in their neighbourhood was never sus pected. The main camp where Leysid, Boolger, and Burns, with the drivers of the teams, lived was back from the river some 300 yards, on a knoll. Near to the river bank was a sheepyard, in which the fat sheep for consumption were folded. Arthurs was sent down the river some eight miles with the dry sheep, and the most reliable shepherds with him. There was a hut for the shepherds to sleep in. Leysid's preparations were hardly completed when the rain descended in such torrents as are only experienced in the tropics. In the middle of the wet the ewes commenced to lamb. The river was at its height, the adjoining country being the only sound ground�all else was one bog. After the rain ceased and the river fell to its normal level, sheep were reported missjngin twos and threes from the flock at the river. The shepherd vowed that they were taken out of the yard, instancing one peculiarly marked sheep which he saw enter the yard on the previous night. No noise had been heard; the dogs gave no warning. Old Paddy Gran, the shepherd, said, "I'm thinking 'tis the naygurs, bad cess to 'em. Me fine black-faced wedder is gone. Tis lonely I'll be widout 'im. He'd ate bread out iv me hand like a Christian, so he wud. And more be token, the sheep that's gone were the fattest of the flock." " I will watch myself," said Scoles to Leysid. " Say nothing to the other men." He constructed a small hut of boughs on the side next the river, whence he could see the yard. The first night of his watch no sheep were taken. On the second night, which was starlit and clear, hearing a stir among the sheep. Scoles crept cautiously round under shelter of the fence, rifle in hand. Two dark forms were crouched alongside the fence; he was curious to know in what manner they effected their purpose without disturbing tho flock. While watching the movements of those two he noticed that the sheep on the farther side of the yard were rising one or two at a time, and crossing to where the blacks were, as sheep will do when something disturbs without frightening them, such as a rat or other vermin in the timber of which the yard was composed. Close and closer the sheep pressed, turning and looking to the side they had left. Suddenly down went a sheep without a struggle. Now, how were they going to get the body out of the yard without rising and so alarming the flock ? One of them inserted a stick, crooked at the end, between the poles of the yard. It just reached the dead sheep. After a few ineffectual attempts the crook caught on the sheep's legs, and by the united efforts of the two the body was drawn close to the fence. The third black, who had been as it were driving the sheep, now came round, gliding along the ground snake wise. Three arras were thrown over the fence, the dead sheep was raised on to the fence, from that on to the shoulders of one, who made straight for the river bed, where some dark objects were just discernible. Scoles allowed him to reach the river bank, then he tired, and down went the black and his load. The dark forms disappeared up the opposite bank, and Leysid and Will came running down at the report. The sheep lay there, but no black. " What have you got, Ned ?" said Leysid. " I have not what I ought to have, replied he. "Here's the sheep, but no darkie. I sighted him right enough, not seventy yards away. The piece is good at 200. It's the light I suppose." " Never mind," said jL,ey�ii�l f "I am just a* 

 well pleased that the poor wretch escaped. This may bo a caution to thorn to lot our mutton alone." �" Caution !" growled Ned. " I'll mako it a caution to the thieving black vermin the next time I drop on to them." "Nay, Ned, do not bo bloodthirsty,"said Leysid. [to be continued.]
