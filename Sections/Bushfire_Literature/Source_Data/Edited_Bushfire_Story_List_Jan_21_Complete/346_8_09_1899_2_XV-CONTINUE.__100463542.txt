 CHAPTER XV.� ^CosmrcEi,. 

 Like the &poarles,he toiled with his hands And trout about, in his unlearned way, striving to do good. Who shall nay that some tit (he seed thus unskilfully sown did not fall Upon good ground, and bring forth increase ? It was a strangely solemn sight to see & couple of hundred rough, sun-bronzed, bearded men, clad in their clay-stained habiliments, standing bareheaded under 

 tne tan trees, tnrotign whose boughs tlte wind sang a gentle requiem over the dead, listening to 'the words of blessed pro mise,' and to the rattle of the earth on the coffin of their late comrade. After the funeral a committee was ap pointed to deal with the deceased man's belong ~i2s. Bis mining implements, blnntets, tent, and so on, were, of course, given to his party ; but a portrait, a Bible, nnd a watch, which we found in his swug. and a lock of his hair, were sent, with a note containing a few wordB of sympathy, to the address on a letter from his mot iier. in Boston. The mystery was never cleared up on the flat, nor could we fairly fix suspicion on any individual. Certainly there were some queer characters amongst us � men capable, probably, of any vifiainy � but that told nothing; and amongst men whose hands had to keep their heads, and -who were not slow to avenge an irsult or injury, ic was not a safe rhino to hazard a suspicion that could not be substantiated. True, had the outrage been sheeted home to anyone, it is likely that, immediately after the murder at all events, a short shrift and a long cord would hare been Lis doom ; for, although lynch law never obtained on the Australian goldfieids, still the diggers of the early days were not the men to stick at trifles. It was very unpleasant, this uncertain tyr -Jiearly enough the deed liad been ?committed, but who was to blame? Men � even in some cases mates � grew strange and shy of one another ; many left for other places ; and heartburnings, disseusion, and jealousy reigned in our little community, until one day came a terrible catastrophe, that drove the mem ory of the murder from men's minds, and gave them other affairs, in which they were more immediately interested, to lalk of. CHAPTER XVI fike! fire) It was December, 1854. We � ftiafc is, -Jim and myself, for some of our party had left and gone to one or other of the new diggings that were breaking out every ?day � had been on she creek for more thin a year, and, taking one thing with another, had done very well indeed. We bad had letters from home, con taining but little of interest to me, save ?those which came from my uncle, and ?which merely told me of the wsH-being of himself, the family, and of Bella. I never wrote to her directly, nor she to me, for there was a tacit understanding that I waB not as yet an accepted lover, and my pride forbade my doing anything underhand to n-in her. But never a letter came from him that did not coutain -a blue 'Forget-me-not,' withered and ifaded it is true, but Btill a ' Forgetme not.' I knew who sent it. How it cot into the letter I did not know. Whether it was put in by stealth, or whether the -old man happened to be looking another way when the letter was sealed, I could not tell, but there it was. My father's letters were as regular and as methodical as his own book -keeping, and once I had a miEsive from Charlie, a. kind of duty letter, which I as dutifully answered. That he had notepad in im wooing I well knew ; the bonme blue flowers told me that, for I knew that Bella was too honest and true a girl to give her hand to one, and to send love tokens to another. And thus with tne liad the time gone -on, toiliug haid at the precarious labour of gold digging ; 1 had gone on steadily making monev, and, although neither -Jim nor myself were either mean or stingy, we did not, as too many did, plunge recklessly into the wild whirl of mad, riotous living that characterised all the digging townships of those days. We had done sometimes well, sometimes bad ly, and though we had not made any of the monster finds that set the world -ablaze with excitement, yet we had money iu the bank, at�d were well satis fied. Tue diggings � which, by the way, I *?ev rteutian. for reason* that those who t 

 hate been there will understand, were not on Fiery Creek, but on one of its head tributaries� were not of any great , extent ^the ground was very patchy, and the sinking difficult; and many men pre- | ierreHj after a few trials, to try the more extensive workings lower down, and on the main creek itself. Yet there was of course, the usual quantity of straggling stores and erog shanties to supply the necessities 'and luxuries for a couple of hundred men, for at about that number our little communi ty steaaily kept. . Taken for all in all, we weie a peaceable lot ; for, although there were frewient quarrels and fights and drunken (iranls, yet the good sense of the majority: had sufficient restraint on the wilder and more reckless ones to pre vent any serious outbreaks. ' I began, this chapter by saying that it was in December, 1854. Those who re member the end of 1854 will also remem ber that the season. was an exceptionally hot one. While folks at home were shivering under the hard frost and heavy snow of Old Britain, those in, this newer Britain weie sweltering beneath the fierce heat of a semi-tropical Kummer. While they there were wrapping themselves dose in their greatcoats and their then fashionable plaids, we here were doffing our garments, and almost wishing, with the humourist, that 'we could take off our flesh, and walk about in our bones.' It was hot, hot, burning, broiling hot., from the rising of the sun till the setting of the same ; and then it was hot, hot, 'hickly, huniidly, oppressively hot, so hot, so densely, overpoweringly hot, as to render simple respiration a burden, a trouble, a nuisance, and a task, until long after midnight. There used to be ar: old story about a jackass in Liverpool that was too lazy to draw anything, and that when he wanted to die he sent for another jackass to help him to draw his last breath. 'The bearing of this story lies in tiie application thereof,' so far as the effect of the heat of that summer is con cerned. Men felt, not with regard to their last breath, but with regard to breathing generally, as if they wanted assistance to breathe at all. The only time when men could feel themselves to live, so to speak, was in the early morn ing, when the dew rested on the drooping leaves, and on the* tents that shimmered whitely in the dim twilight, before the fierce sun came up abhrse, like a barbaric Eastern potentate in all his. glory, to chase the thin mist and the cooling mois ture from the face of the earth. There bad been no rain for weeks'and weeks ; the sky, unflecked even by the faintest shadow of the most fleecy cloud, was blue, blue, deeply, unalterably blue. Tcere was rarely a breath of wind, and when that did come, it was ever from the north and west � a wind that came over hundreds of leagues of burning, sterile, sandy, and stony desert, of dried Dp salt lakes, and of otherwise the vast plains where the Bad, silent abomination of deso lation reigns. It was ever from the north and west, and it beat upon our already - parched aud fevered faces like the blast of a furnace. The earth was. parched, and gasped thirstily for water ; the grass was sere and yellow ; and the trees and bushes hung languidly and dustily ip the glowing sunshine. The creeks had dried up, or had shrunken into mere chains of waterholes or threads of runnels, and the lakes were salt-bordered ewamps. Cattle drooped, and lolled out; their long tongues beneath the delusive refuge of the ehadeless trees; and men worked faintly amidst sweat and dust, and drank, and smoked, and grumbled the whole day long. The cicadas which chirped their ceaseless fong from morn to night,. and the mosquitos that p-r-r-rcd round both morn and night, were the only living things that seemed to . enjoy the fun. Everything was saturated with heat � the earth until it cracked, the atmosphere until it quiv. red. The bush fires raged on the distant ranges to the north and the far away plains to the west, with dense clouds of dark smoke in the day, and a dull lurid glare in the night. It was as if '* the earth should melt like wax, and the liea veus be dissolved with fervent beat.' Day flfter day this lasted, day after day it became more intense, until the sparse herbage crackled underfoot, and the dried-up leaves of the gum trees darkened and hung listlessly from their scorched boughs. One Sunday forenoon, just before - twelve o'cluck, when the �U�. was beating fiercely on the baked earth � 1 was lying panting in my tent at the time, having given sleep upas a bad job � there was a sudden alarm, a cry, a rush of hurrying feet, and I roused myself sufG iently to get up aud look out. I sau- a. sight winch made my heart leap into my mouth. The rises close by were in a blaze, and the fire, leapius from tree to tree and from bush to bush, and licking up the brown grass beneath, was rapidly travelling downwards towards �he flat. Cattle and horses were flying madly away in all directions, mobs of kangaroos flopping over the flats, blundering into the tents or anywhere else in their terror, and flocks of parrots, laughing jackasses, leatherheads, and other birds screaming overhead, or dropping into the blinding and suffocating smoke. Men were hurry ing hither and thither, bewildered, and not knowing what to do or where to turn, for the fire was on them on both sides.of the creek. Suddenly a voicf� ib._ mas Jim Cragg's � rang out as if by inspiration, 'Down the holes, men!'., and it- rwas; passed on from mouth to mouth to -the furthermost part of the flat. The effect -.mat electri cal; as if in an instaut^the Jiat/tws cleared. What 'was ?few. very few. 

 minutes - before a scene of busy . fife, was now as barren, save for the presence of a few empty and deserted shanties, anil for the heaps of washdi.-t, which looked like gigantic molehills, as it had becu before the foot of the white mm trod it. .Tents, stores, bedding, everything that would burn, tossed hurly-burly, higgledypiggle dy down the shafts, with their owners sitting on - them, ? waiting with beating heart* the coming of the enemy they were powerless to resist. Nor bad they long to wait, for, in a shorter time than it takes to tell, down came the fierce flame with a Bwish and a swirl amougst the brown grass, and a wild roar, like the booming of . distant artillery, aB it caught the dry plumage of the trees and the bare stumps and limbs of those that were dead. ?-' - - -This was a serious blow for some of the storekeepers ;. for, beside the fact, that most of them had to leave a great portion of tneir stocks in their shanties, to be consumed by. the fire, a still greater por tion was smashed or- irretrievably ruined by being thrown into the holes. Still, it could not be helped, and so they had to console themselves as best they might, by reflecting that it was. the fortune of war, and that tbftir profits were so large that they could afford it One young fellow, a Jew, named Isaac Marks, familiarly known as ** Ikey,' who had not been ?long on the -flat, and who was only just commencing business, I was especially sorry for. He was a quiet, deceut, civil chap, generally liked in the camp for his cheery and obliging manner. He was, although very close and exact in matters of business, liberal, even generous, in his way ; aud many a. poor fellow, both Je'v and Gentile, had ample reason to be grateful to Ikey for a free feed, or foi 'tucker' for his swag, when, flat broke, he determined to try his luck elsewhere. Ikey's store � a few slats, hastily put up, and having a bark roof� lay back on the fiat, some distance from the workings, and about a hundred and fifty yards from us, who were his nearest neighbours. We tried to give him a hand when we had made all right for ourselves ; but it was only a little we could do, for sacks of flour aud chests of tea were not handy tilings to carry. However, we managed to get away with some slops and blankets, leaving the heavier goods to take care of themselves. Ikey was as one demented, and it was with exeat trouble we forced him out of harm's way himself. I never saw a man so thoroughly broken-hearied. He sat down and cried like a child. ' Oh, my beautiful goodth ! Oh, I'm ruined, mined � all gone, everything gone � oh. I oh ! oh !' We tried to cheer him up, telling him that he ought to be glad to have saved what he bad, that it couldn't be helped, that there was no good to be got by grieving, and so on ; but it was of no avail, for still he sat lamenting. 'Vafll Phillipth thay to me� vatll Cohenth thay to me, nectht month ? Oh, I'm broke for ever � ruined, ruined ! Oh ! oh!' We pitted the poor fellow exceedingly, but we could hardly help laughing at his wild, irrational grief ; for we knew well enough that neither Phillips, nor Cohen, nor all the children of Israel could help what was done, and that they would re stock him soon enough, and let his bills lie over for a time. We told him as much, but be would not be comforted ; and so we allowed him have his cry out. The flat presented a curious scene when we got out of our harbours of refuge. The earth hot, black, bare, with here and there a tusscck still smouldering. The smoke roBe with a dense, acrid fume, and rolled in a thick, grey cloud overhead ; and the air was impregnated with the sharp, smell of charred . timber and burnt foliage, and thick with smuts that floated gently downward like black snowflakes. It was curious to see the men crawling out of the holes, like so many rabbits out of a warren, aud cabling np their treas ures as if they had been drawing water from a well. After all, there had not been so much damage done as might have been expect ed, for the graEs had been so dry that the fire had passed by like a flash, and hardly any of the stores had really taken fire. Two of them were, however, blazing merrily, and in others the fire was smouldering. . They were soon put out, though, for everybody lent a hand. We helped Ikey at his; and when he saw how little had really been destroyed, he became as loud m his expressions* of de light as be bad been in his moans of despair. His dray was untouched � the paint a little blistered, that was all ; his flour bags somewhat 'singed ; l and his hams aud bacon got a little preliminary touch, of frying, which sent a rather un Hebrew-like atoma into our nostrils. Otherwise, the damage was very slight; and when he got his things out of the hole into which we had thrown them, the place looked almost the same as be fore. .., ? :. He was �refuse in bis expressions of gratitude, and bis promises to do a good turn for us if ever he could (promiss which I afterwards found were really meant, and not the idle wind such pro mises generally torn out), and insisted on our having some champagne, a fear bottles of which he kept on tLe sly. ' It did not take long to put things to rights on the flat. The remnants of the fire were beaten and trodden out ^ and amidst the laughter and ringing merri ment of the men, who, now the danger was ever, be?an Xo view the affair iu the light of a huge practical joke, the white tents were soon gleaming agaiu in the sunlight, What was the caus* of this sudden fire? As the Spaniards nav. 

 ,-? %fiiven saoe!' perhaps a lighted snatch thrown down amongst the dry grass by some careless swa�uian on the other aide of the rises; perhaps a camp fire left burning at the foot of a hollow tree, which, catching, would blaze like a. fur nace up the flue-like interior ; perhaps a bit of broken bottle acting as a burning glass. All these tilings liave been; ere now, causes of conflagrations more ter rible and destructive than this. CHAPTER XVLL WATER. . After all, we were more frightened than L hurt, for in reality the damage done was not to any great extent, and save that it took iu some time to get our cattle back from the. swamps where. they had instinc tively taken refuge, things were very soon in the same state as they had been before the fire. ' { Christmas and the New Tear had come and gone � we had eaten the conventional roast beef and plum pudding, in our shirt sleeves, and in the open air, under the shade nf a friendly tree that sheltered us from the fierce rays of the sun over bead � and we : were getting far into autumn. It had been an exceptionally hot .season, and save a few showers, which barely sufficed to k^ep the water holes from failiug, we had had no rain, during -the year. But it came at last. We wished for it, and we got what we wished for � a little more than we wished for, as you shall see. It was a sultry day in March � about the 20lu, I think � when the rain com menced to fall. It had been singularly dark and heavy for days before � a muggy atmosphere, as they say, hot and unpleas ant. The cattle seemed uneasy and rest less,- and the flies were exceedingly troublesome. It was as if the air were laden with something that made every body feel dull and dispiritsd. Electri city, perhaps, or a prescience of coming calamity. On the day I have named, the sky began to gloom, and the atmo sphere to thicken. A few fisful gusts of wind had been blowing from the south east during the night, wailing mournfully through the trees ; and about noon, blnck, low-lying clouds began to steal up from the horizon. The rain was heralded by a few light pattering drops, followed by a sharp shower that fell away to Scotch mist. This continued until night fall, and then came the storm. - . Anything grander than that tempest in the bush can scarcely be conceived. The rain fell in torrents, and our tents, the ropes of which had been slackened by the heat, became tight as drums. The night was dark as pitch, save when every few seconds the surrounding country was literally lit up with a weird, unearthly glare of vivid lightning, that played on every hand, and that shot athwart us with a blinding flash, rendering the black darkness still more dark. The thunder broke incessantly � now with a deafen i -??; i crash that seemed to shake the Very en ;' beneath our feet, now rolling in a lo.i ruinble amongst the echoing bills. Happy those whose tents were water tight and had flies to them, that dismal - night; happy those who had had the foresight to erect bunks in them to keep them off the ground. Toward morniug the thunderstorm bore ? away to the north. Not so the rain. ; That continued to fall harder and harder, \\ thicker- and faster, with a steady down- : pour, as if the windows of heaven had been unloosed. As the day broke darkly and gloomily, the aspect was one the reverse of inspiriting. The rain com pletely shut out the view of the surround ing country ; and the creek, which yes terday was a mere chain of little pools, was now rushing hoarsely by, a raging torrent. The trickling waterfalls were transformed into fierce cataracts of yellow water, that leapt from rock to rock, with a harsh roar, into the troubled pools beneath. ? .*..-. Fast as the rain fell, however, there was no water on the flat. That was a pleasure to come. The thirsty earth drank up the grateful moisture as fast as it fell, and. although walking in the mud was unpleasant, it was not difficult, as the earth was firm underneath. It was a dismal day in good sooth. The cattle stood- moping under the trees ; dogs were shivering under the drays, or * wherever else they could find, shelter ; and here and there might be seen a miner wrapped up in his oilskins, piling up his fuel in a dry place; or drearily keeping his fire up. Most of us hnd chimney fire llac s, so that, although the heavy rain beat down them, and hissed and sputtered amongst the glowing embers, there was no fear of our fires going out� while we had wood. � To re Continued. LF 7 An interesting account has come to h�nd of the methods of production adopted in the great aluminium works at Ned chauser, on the Rhine. Pure alumina is first fused, and then decomposed by a current of electricity, the metal beingr ran off. intu moulds as tast as it is produced. Tiie: vessel in. which ibis -process takes place is an iron box, lined with -charcoal, wiiich series as the negative cerminnL or cathode, the anode consisting1 -of a number of ? carbon rods claced vertic lllj- and dip pins into the box.
