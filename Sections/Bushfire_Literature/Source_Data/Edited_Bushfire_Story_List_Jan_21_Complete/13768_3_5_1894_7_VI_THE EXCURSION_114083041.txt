Dear, inost dear, to Mrs. Fane, was the pomp and state she received as mistress of Faversham TTn.11, It was the evening after the quarrel that had taken place, related in the last chapter, and since then Mrs. Fane had been keeping' up the ball of indignation in. her heart, had been feeding her enmity to her husband. But now, with all the pomp and ceremony of a large dinner party, and the future pleasures of a fortnight before her she did not feel so sure about it. Not a single word had they spoken to one another since that un seemly recrimination. She in her resent ment would not speak to her husband -, he did his best to humor her mood, and allow her a little time to come to her senses. For all anyone saw they were upon the pleasant terms that man and wife should be. She 'Was lively, laughing, and gay ; he courteous and attentive to her in the last degree. Squire Fane had begun by entertaining his guests right regally, as a Fane was always wont to do on such occasions, and he would so continue to entertain them nn^ii the fortnight for which they were invited came to an end. There were to be excur sions abroad, evening festivities at home, occasionally varied with men's out-of-door Sports. The morning following the arrival of the guests some of the gentlemen departed on & shooting expedition, while it was pro posed that the ladies,, should drive, over . to Davingtan Hill and meet the gentlemen at the Grange, the residence of Sir Francis Panton and lunch there, then explore the neighborhood around, not forgetting the fains belonging to John Fane. This proposal was hailed with delight by the ladies and ?flie remaining gentlemen. The morning had dawned fair and bright, so all Mrs. Fane's guests were assembled on the wide steps landing from the marble Tm.11, Several horses and carriages were waiting in the avenue. Lady Sturen had been the first to drive off with Sir Francis, as she had promised to play the role of hostess for Tiim. It was a glorious day, the sun seemed never weary of shiTiing in the cloudless sky, making glad the merry ^group of pleasure seekers from the oldhalL ** The Grange is a beautiful place,' said Colonel Thome to Mrs. Fane, as they drove along in wake of the other carriages, ' quite a show place.' ' Is it F' said Mrs. Fane. ' I have often heard Lady Sturen speak of it in the highest terms.' ' Sir Francis is a lucky beggar to get it,' continued the colonel ; ' the late owner was only a distant relative, and Sir Francis did , not expect it, of course, only, you see, the old man lost his wife and his son in a boat ing accident, and so it was that it fell into the hands of his harum-scarum relative of his'} but you know he will never settle down, he is too fond of pleasure seeking.' ' He is very fond of the continent so he told me,' observed Mrs. Fane. ' More ease and more laxness to follow his whims,' remarked the ColoneL *i Do you, not like him, Colonel Thome?' asked Mrs. Fane in surprise. ' Well, I suppose he is a very good fellow in hi6 way, but I should be sorry to see one of my daughters married to him, if I had any. . Ypu know I heard strange rumors about him. when his regiment was stationed atBhagoipur. A pretty place Bhagcalpur, only 265 miles from Calcutta. Well, as I said before, when his regiment was stationed at Bhagalpur in the year 1835, there were rumors of some scandal about bi-rn. Anyhow he sent in his resignation, and those who knew nothing about the scandal thought he I resigned because he had come in for his fortune.' I As the colonel fcaid this he carefully watched the features of Mrs. Fane to see what impression this announcement would have upon her, for amongst the Faversham scandal-mongers it was -whispered that Mrs. Fane preferred the company of Sir Francis to that of her husband. So Colonel Thome was determined the first opportunity he got he would probe the matter and see how things stood. But to-day Mrs. Fane was very reserved. She seemed to have guessed in a sort of way what Golonel Thome was trying to find out. She was feeling a deadly hate against the man -who drove by her side, yet she durst not betray in any way her I feelings for fear the colonel should guess I her secret liking for Sir Francis. I ' They say his mother -was an actress, or I something o� the sort,' continued the I colonel j ' and before he could claim. ' the I property he had to prove his legitimacy; I but I am happy to say nothing could be I proved against the good lady, whatever her I origin may have been.' I 'My dear Colonel Thome 1' interposed I Mrs. Fane. 

 ' Rumor, my dear madam, rumor ; but I am alwayB adverse to rumor. Though that reminds. me there was a rumor, when I was in India in 1835, that Sir Francis -was married.' A start from Mrs. Fane, which, luckily for her, was not noticed, as the colonel was busy watching the horse at that moment. . ' You do not mean to say so j and where is his wife, pray,' said Mrs. Fane. ' People say that he married beneath him, and he is ashamed of her, so she lives ou the Continent, and that accounts � as T'� friends say � for his frequent absences from Eng 

 land.' ' I will not believe it,' said Mrs. Fane in such a tone as to cause the colonel to turn round and look at her. ' But here is ' The Grange,' ' she cried, sitting up eagerly and pushing back her hat, the brim of the hat being broad got in the way, and prevented her from seeing everything. The Grange had stood in bygone days alone, surrounded by gardens, but at this date a broad space of public road � this road led to the high road to Faversham � run- ning along the front of the Grange, divided it from tbe gardens once belonging to it. They were now the public property of the town of Davington. The property of the Grange was still extensive ; and the old house stood at a good distance from the road, the carriage drive being in the shape of an S, while chestnut trees of some remote date grew on each side of this avenue. As the sunlight fell upon the old house it looked a magnificent building. It was a large place, built of softly tinted grey stone, with heavy mullion windows and tall chimney stacks up which the ivy climbed. Behind it a -wood of dark hued fir trees that formed a background, showing the full beauty of the delicate architecture that adorned the house. The carriages -were being driven away to the stables when Mrs. Fane and Colonel Thome arrived and' were received by Sir Francis, who waited for the last instalment ! of his guosts. Everyone was busy examin ing, admiring, and sauntering about the hall when Sir Francis and Mrs. Fane entered followed by the coloneL All the guests being assembled the whole party made their way to the din ing-hall to partake of luncheon, to which all did ample justice. Mrs. Fane sat at the right side of Sir | Francis, who headed the long luncheon | table with its glittering silver and dainty drapery and Bohemian glass. ' You ought to give a ball here at Christ- ' mas, Sir Francis,' said Mrs. Fane, glancing j round at the largo dining-h*dl, almost I twice the size 'of the one at Faversham Hall, only not quite so handsome. ' This would make a matchless ball-room,' ' I will give you carte blanche, Mrs. j Fane,' the young man replied gaily ; ' you may give half-a-dozen balls if yoa like, I will place The Grange at your disposal.' ' Now that is very good of you,' she re turned, laughing. ' But, kind as it sounds, I believe it is only a base subterfuge to transfer the trouble from your shoulders to mine ; besides, John and I have enough to do with those we give at the HalL' ' Not exactly,' rejoined Sir Francis, reply- ! ing to the first part of the answer, ' only ; that as I shall in all probability not spend my Christmas here, I ? ' ' 'Then where will you spend it?' she interrupted. ' I do not exactly know at present, hub I am going abroad again,' he answered care lessly. 'Going abroad, again?' repeated Sir Charles, who was standing near. ' Why man you have only be'en in England about two months.' j ' Well, one may tire of perfidious Albion i in two months. Eh ?'' ! *' Certainly not, why you are absent six months out of the 12. I believe the con tinent has some attraction for him. Don't you, Mrs. Fane ?'? said Sir Charles. l Here they were interrupted by Squire Fane, demanding those who were ready and able to explore around Davington, It -was about half-past 3 o'clock, and already the shadows were lengthening upon the grass, a slight breeze was blowing, towards the group assembled in the avenue of The Grange, sweet essences of pine wood arid dark fir. Out in the -woods the wintry dusk was gathering thickly, the MUs loomed, dark and solemn in the fading light. Above in the clear sky the fleecy clouds assumed each moment a new form � a yet more soft color � now' pale blue, now grey. Down in the far hollow a -white mist was floating away to the ocean ; and the hush and calm of evening was slowly but surely breaking upon the earth. It was a good 20 minutes or more walking distance from The Grange to the Ruins belonging to John Fane, whither the party proceeded. On the brow of the. Tiiii stood the chapel that once belonged to the Davington Nunnery, and is now one of the village churches ; its bell is heard in the distant village, about a mile off. It is not a very handsome building. This chapel consists of a nave and two small aisles, separated by semi-circular arches rising from quadrangular piers ; the western entrance opening beneath a recess with foliage and creepers, and rising from the south are columns on each side. Over this are three round-headed windows, two smaller ones above, and a am�H single tower rises from the north-west angle. Part of the house that belonged to the nuns still remained^_and -was occupied by a farmer, who rented it from. John Fane, The zoad up to these buildings went in a zig-zag course, and was shaded by trees, from be tween which the exploring party obtained views of the varied scenery around, and the wide sea far beyond. ' What a pretty spot,' cried Mrs. Fane, enthusiastically. ' It -would be if it -were not for those ugly powder Tnilla yonder,' said Dick Dean. ' They are certainly, not handsome, never theless they are very old and extremely use ful for the gunpowder they export,'* said John Fane.' ' What is that small �quare enclosure over there ?' asked Mrs. Spencer. 

 ' Where ?' said the colonel. ' To the right,' replied Mrs. Spencer. ' That, madam, was supposed to be a cemetery belonging to the nuns, but it is now called, the Ruins, and. belongs to the squire. He keeps it always locked. ; whether he has any Eking for horrors, or whether it is to prevent the poachers snaring the young birds that abound in there, I do not know,' responded the colonel. The place referred to was not much to look at, but it -was considered something to possess it, as being a curiosity in the neighborhood on account of the Latin inscription on the tombs, many equalling those of the far-famed gravestones in the cloister of Worcester Cathedral. It was a square piece of ground, surrounded by a low stone wall. All traces of the mortuary chapel were gone, but its mossy gravestones ?were imbedded in the ground still, and the spot remained sacred as a graveyard, with the excepton that the game birds had got in- and made their nest there, and this was the principal reason why John Fane kept the place closed, so that the poachers or boys of the village should not disturb them. ' Who were the nuns ?' asked Annie Vue, who always liked to be seen and heard. ' They were the Benedictine order, estab lished by Father de Newnham at Davington in 1153. But they deserted their possessions during the reign of Henry VIII. , who | escheated their lands to tbe Crown,' said Colonel Thome, always glad of a good listener. 1 It was a lovely evening. All down the ?western slope of the fir-crowned hill the fading rays of light still lingered. The deadleavesthat speak of autumn and coming dissolution float towards the pleasure party as they wend their way to the ruined ceme tery below, and sinking at their feet bring to them a lesson that in this changeable world nothing lasts. ' What are the moving forma I see down there ?' asked Mrs. Fane. ' Only children nn^niq.^nTipr^' said Dick Dean, promptly. ' What ?' said Sir Francis. ' I have said, only children undulating,' returns Dick. ' Surely it is something else,' said Mrs. Fane. Every head is' turned in the direction of the firs. ' It is only a jenny on her fact,' said Dick at length after a careful examina tion of the moving form. ' On what ?' said Sir Charles. ' Her fact,' repeats Dick unmoved. ' What is that?' inquires Annie Vue, ' Really Dick you must explain yourself ,' said the squire with dignity. ' Why, it is1 only a donkey I' cried Mrs. Fane, ' with a girl on its back.' ' Just so,' said Dick, ' I always call them facts because they are stubborn things.' They had reached the ruins at last, not much to be seen truly, and hardly worth the walk down the hill to see. ' Here is a nice seat, colonel,' indicates Dick, as they approach a low flat square marble slab raised about four feet from the ground but cracked across. 'Come, I heard you say you were tired. Come and sit down, and tell us if you know anything of the owner of this earthy domain,' he con tinued, taking the latter by the arm, and placing Tifm beside himself on the edge of the slab. ' Hawkins, Hawkins, why that was the old Catholic family you know ? ' ' But I do not know, colonel, that is why I asked you,' interrupted Dick. ' Sir Thomas Hawkins was an early translator of Horace, -who died in the reign of Charles I.,' continued the colonel, heed less of Dick's interruption. ' The last possessor left an only daughter, -who was the third wife of Sir Edward Knatchbull. If you go to Nash the people there will tell you all about Haw ? �' 'Oh! Dean, that is too bad of you,' cried the unfortunate colonel, ' you might have told me you were going to get up.' For Dick, having heard sufficient about Hawkins, had risen. The slab being loose and the colonel eloquent on the subject of Hawkins found his level with earth. ' I beg your pardon, colonel, I did not know the slab was loose,' said Dick, help ing to assist the fallen colonel and shake , the dust off him. ' I am so sorry ; are you much hurt ?' It was as much as those standing around I could do to suppress the laughter at the i pitiful figure the colonel cut. j ' Are you much hurt ?' inquired Squire I Fane with solicitude. ' I will be bound thip is one of Dick's tricks again.' ' Really, John, it was quite uninten tionally done ; how 'was I to know the slab was loose,' answered Dick. 'What is in that place,' asked Mrs. Fane. . . Death ! The shadow cloafd from head to foot,' Who keeps the keys of all the creeds quoted Dick. ' I mean can you see any dead men's bones P* said Mrs. Fane. * 'You should say dead -women's bones, Mrs. Fane, it would be more correct, as it says, * Sacred to the memory of Sister Mary Hawkins,' ' answered Dick. ?' How foolish,' said Annie Vue, with an air of contempt. ' There is nothing to be seen, Isba,' said John Fane. -rt When I first came home the top -was off, and I gave Pat orders to have it made secure, but I suppose he forgot it.' Yonder Sir Francis is in his element. He is flirting with, everyone, and is -making love indiscriminately all round � with old maids and young� married and single � with the most touching impartiality. Pre sently he comes towards Squire Fane and addresses himi ** Squire, some of us are longing to have our fortunes told, and it might easily be done. Not very far off there is a gipsy encampment, so I think we might terminate a very pleasant day by a visit to them.' . : .. So the party quickly make their �jdt from the ruins and take the road towards the gipsies, leaving1 John Fane to close and. lock - the gate. (to be continued.)
