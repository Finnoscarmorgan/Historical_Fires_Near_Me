THE GENII of the VANGUARD. BY F. E. LOCKWOOD. [All Rights Reserved.] CHAPTER XII. A NEW VISITOR AT TITTORA. The doctor had gone to see Milmilty and to enquire after Pulee. It was afternoon and Mr. Attenborough was sowing seeds in his garden. Two of the station-hands' wives had arrived and also Mrs. Ah Sin, who seemed a very undesirable sort of woman. She had with her a little boy whose face bespoke his Chinese origin, as did also his name "Gun." The mother was very fond of creating sensations, and when she could find no other way she would fall on this child and beat him most unmercifully. In this exer- cise Ah Sin seemed afraid to inter- fere. He was, he said, "afraid of losing his wife." No doubt the woman instilled this notion into him, and took some means, best known to herself, of keeping such a form of punishment constantly before him. Mr. Attenborough, who, although he never went to the men's kitohen, had his eyes and ears open, soon saw enough to convince him that Ah Sin and his family must be removed. He therefore sent for a man whose wife had already arrived and saidï¿½ "Do you think you and your wife could manage the kitchen? The fact is, that woman is not fit to be amongst us. I am sorry I allowed her to come at all. However, if you will take the place as cook, your wife can help in many ways when my family comes, which will be soon." The man agreed to take the place, and then Ah Sin was sent for and told that it would be much better if he and his wife were in a place by themselves. There was an out-station about six miles on the track to Mount Yatna, and the Chinaman was offered the position of shepherd there. Ah Sin himself was very pleased at the prospect. There were many ways in which he could make extra money, such as catching birds for sale and making straw hats. You may always trust a Chinaman to find out ways and means when he is thrown amongst us heathen. But Mrs. Ah Sin was not pleased. She saw that she was being got rid of, and let her tongue loose pretty freely, vowing vengeance on all the employees when her turn should come. In spite of all this, Ah Sin and his family were carted off to their new home. The Chinaman did his duty as a shepherd well, and things pros- pered under his hand. He made a pretty garden, and fitted up his slab hut with nice fancy seats and tables. Indeed it was a showplace for callers, and the man was quite happy, if his wife was not. One day Mr. Attenborough rode over to see the sheep in Ah Sin's charge, and finding him still out, started in search of him. When on the plains he was surprised to see two horsemen coming towards him. On a nearer view one turned out to be a native and the other a dis- tinguished-looking man, but soiled and worn with travel, dust, and heat. When they drew rein the stranger asked whether there was accommoda- tion to be had for payment within a reasonable distance. 

 "My head station is only a few miles from here," said Mr. Atten- borough. "If you like we will go there at once. I came out to look for one of my shepherds, but I dare say he is all right." "If you mean a Chinaman, he is all right; we saw him with the sheep on the open heath country." On this assuranoe they turned their horses' heads towards Tintora. That means taking the nearest way, by going straight on, and if an obstacle presents itself on the line, go round it if you cannot got across it. That's a bushman's fashion. "Hungry, Johnnie?" said the new comer to his black who was riding humble behind. "Big one," was the emphatic reply. "I daresay he is. We have had only an oppossum since the day before yesterday. I wanted to share it fairly; but he made me eat the better part of it and feasted himself on the refuse bits." "It's pretty daring to go about this country trusting to natural supplies," said Mr. Attenborough ; "I have done it, but never from choice." "When they reached the station, the stranger threw his bridle to the black boy; and going to the well, drew a bucket of water, threw off his old cab- bage-tree hat, drank freely and then washed his face and hands, wiped him self on a piece of rag which he drew from under his belt, and which might have been a handkerchief at one time, and then went to the stables after Johnnie. The groom had taken off the saddles and putting them across the fence, led the horses into the paddock. He knew the mode universal on sheep farms; that was certain. In the meantime Mr. Attenborough went to the kitchen and ordered a meal to be prepared at once. "Do you know who you have got with you sir?" said the cook. "No, I do not." "Well, I know him. It's Mr. Arm- strong; one of the oldest and richest sheep farmers in South Australia; and one of the cleverest amongst sheep." "Well, he goes about in a strange way." "Yes, but he knows what he's after, never fear. If he takes a liking to you, he'll tell you all about it; if not, he is very likely to come over to the kitchen, get a loaf of bread and some tea and sugar, pay you for it, or leave the money, and go on his journey." "I hope he will like me then, for I have taken a great fancy to him." Then going over to his visitor, Mr. Attenborough said, "I had not the pleasure of knowing you when first we met, but my men in the kitchen do. They tell me you are Mr. Armstrong of Milo. I hope you will call for any thing you want, and make yourself at home. I should have said this even if I had not known your name." "I shall do as you ask," said Mr. Armstrong; but please see that my blackboy is well cared for. He has a lot to bear for me this trip." 

 After a good meal of soup, grilled chops, potatoes, ginger-bread, and coffee, the visitor took his saddle, and putting the tree part on the floor of the verandah, laid his head on the soft padding, and immediately fell asleep. He slept so long that Mr. Attenborough almost began to fear that he was never going to wake again. The blackboy, under the shade of a tree, followed the example of his master. As night began to fall Master Johnnie rose in- stinctively, and went over to the men's kitchen, and was received kindly by the men. "Where's my master ?" he asked; "old Armstrong, my old man, plenty tired, plenty hungry." After lighting his pipe, he began to explain to the men the object of their journey, somewhat as follows : "That big one master and me look out country; bring sheep, horse, bul- lock; too many sit down eat grass; too many lamb come, full up Milo, Uno, Rammabola. We ride, ride three day; we lead pack-horse; carry cook meat, tea, sugar, another one; then big one scrub; we cut him road alonga tomahawk ; then we try burn him scrub ; can't, too wet; then mas- ter say, ' take off pack, put him tree, let horse go.' Master carry some flour, me some things; plenty hot, no water. Two sleeps, then we see plenty water, good country. Then we camp; master say, 'very good.' Me say, 'what we eat?' He say, 'you catch opossum, me smoke, drink water, horses spell plenty, eat sheoak.' Me catch old man opossum, roast him, bring him alonga master; he cut half me. I say, 'mucka, you keep him all.' Then me see that one face all right; then we ride, ride. Meet this one master; me think very good." " Yes," said the men, "he is very good." "Here, your shirt is torn ; put this one on, and those trousers," says another. Johnnie gladly took the offered gar- ments and went to the back of the stables to dress carefully. Then folding up the rags he had taken off he strapped them on to his saddle as it hung across the rail, saying that his lubra would wash and mend them when he got back. "Are you going to make a worlie?" asked Mr. Attenborough. "Me can't sleep self; something come in me sleep; kill me; wild blackfellow mundong me. Sleep along master bush all right; he plenty mind me." So Mr. Attenborough asked the cook whether he would mind the native sleeping in the kitchen along side the fire. "I've got a bunk and blankets ready," said the cook; "I know he has been years with Mr. Armstrong; so I know Johnnie is a good fellow. Why, nobody would deceive Mr. Armstrong; he sees right through any one in no time. I had to tell my wife to keep out of sight, though."' "Why was that ?" 

 "Well, you see Mr. Armstrong hates women: the very sight of one makes him leave the place." "Then he is not married ?" "Married, no ! He has heaps of wealth ; he's not only made money for himself, but for many others who have sought his advice. I cannot tell you what he is working for though." Mr. Attenborough went to look at his strange guest, who was still sleep- ing soundly; he threw another rug over him, placed wine and biscuits close to him, and then went to rest himself. Next morning he rose with the dawn, but early as he was, Mr. Arm- strong was up before him, and was coming towards the house with a hat full of hens' eggs, which he had found in the paddock. Soon after, Johnnie put in an appearance in his sound habiliments. 

 Then Mr. Attenborough said, "Mr. Armstrong, I have had no oppor- tunity yet to offer you a change of clothing. Last night you slept so soundly until after midnight that I was unwilling to wake you. There is plenty of clothing on the station; what will you have?" "Some coffee first, and then I will go to the store with you. After that I shall be able to have a talk with you about some things of interest to us both." After the eggs had been eaten and the clothing obtained Mr. Armstrong said, as he took the pipe from his mouth. "Have you got a blacksmith here?" "Yes." "Can he shoe horses?" "Yes." "Well, Whalebone's shoes must come off to-day; and he must be let go without for a day or so." "I will tell the blacksmith to at- tend to it." 

 "Now," said Mr. Armstrong, "how far does your run extend?" Mr. Attenborough produced his lease and showed the boundaries. "Oh, I see. Well don't attempt to put sheep on the extreme north-east end; it is covered with a poison plant and they would die off. There is no better country for sheep than amongst these made hills away at the feet of those great rocky mountains on the other side; and there is good water everywhere." "Then you have been over that country?" "Yes, every part of it." "Did the natives never molest. you?" "Never." "Did you meet them?" "Often." "Were you alone ?" "No, the blackboy was with me." "How did you not?" "Took no notice of them: not so much as I should of kangaroos." "I suppose that's the best way if they don't attack you." "I think so. I should like to look at your sheep, if you don't mind." "With pleasure, if you're not too tired to ride." "Oh, to-morrow will do." Mr. Armstrong then relapsed into thoughtful silence; and Mr. Atten- borough went to write letters to his people. Dinner-time came, and with it the usual roast muttonï¿½a splendid saddle cooked in front of the fire. 

 "I think my cook's wife must have helped him to-day," said Mr. Atten- borough. "Have you a woman here, then?" "Yes, one. She is a very well- conducted person. The Chinaman you saw yesterday also has his wife out there." After dinner horses were saddled and Mr. Attenborough and his guest went out and interview Mrs. Ah Sin. She was very gushing indeed. "Won't you come in, gentlemen," she said, "and have some tea and cakes. Ah Sin bakes them at night. He don't like me to stand over the fire, it spoils my white skin, so he says." She wanted to say mnch more; but Mr. Armstrong had already put some distance between himself and the woman, and Mr. Attenborough curtly asked her which way the sheep went in the morning, and then can- tered off abruptly. "I believe," she said to herself, "if you fellows knew what my Gun found yesterday amongst the stones in the gully, you would have been very glad to come in and talk to me." Mr. Armstrong soon sighted the sheep moving about in the heath, and rode towards them. He looked over the flock with a true squatter's eye. "A few spots," he said, "but a passable flock of maidens. I have imported some pure-bred sisters, and I will lend you twenty of them for this flock and then you will see the im- provement in the first crop of lambs." "Thanks," said Mr. Attenborough, "I hope you have made up your mind to be a neighbour, and that your head station will not be too far away." 

 "I expect to get somewhere to the left of you, and within a few days cartage of the railway. My stations at present are on the west with water cartage on the Murray or Darling. You know the great expense of getting produce to the ships outbalances all the other costs of the woolgrower. The very earliest settlers had a great deal to contend with in this way. Without "bridges or roads, until they made them ; no return from the older land under twelve months; no middle men to buy; what patience and courage it took ! Now everything is differentï¿½ gone to the other extreme. The ends of the earth are drawn together, and this colony is dragged along in the race: it cannot keep time with the growing nations. We may collapse and fall, for we are too new to afford the price asked, namely to compete in our homes and domestic life with a growth of nearly 2000 years. If courts, parliaments, cities, steamage, and electricity had left us alone for another fifty years, we should have passed our childhood-should have been strong enough for the race. As it is we must do the best we can under the circumstances; and take care of what we have." 

 " Yes, you are right," said Mr. At- tenborough, who had listened atten- tively; I am glad of your advice. I am but a new sheep-farmer, though I worked for years as a bushman here, until an unexpected turn of fortune placed me in a better position, one of which I hope to make good use." In truth Mr. Attenborough's com- panion was no ordinary man. His massive head covered with coal black, curly hair, a long jet beard, dark grey deeply set eyes, and Roman nose, all bespoke strength of mind ; and his stalwart form, length of arm and leg showed that he was equally well en- dowed physically. A very king of the bush, all things seemed to treat him with reverence. Quick to decide, and then firm to abide by his own decision, he made few mistakes, and never wasted time. The natives whom he kept about him never de- ceived him. They served him well, because they liked silence and action. These they found in him ; and the tribes he had about him would never think of questioning his words, nor of disobeying his orders. It was an understood thing that what he said was right, and must be done. Mr. Attenborough and he rode home almost in silence, each occu- pied with his own reflections. The next morning Mr. Armstrong saidï¿½ 

 "We must go back to-morrow, Johnnie. Have the horse's feet well looked to. If we remain longer some of our people will be coming to look for us; we have been so long away. " I wish," said Mr. Attenborough, that you could have stayed long enough to meet my partner, Dr. Drummond. He went to Mount Yatna on the same day that I met you." "Oh, I shall call at Mount Yatna as I go back," said Mr. Armstrong. "Winstanley is not a bad fellow, but he would have done better with a market garden near Adelaide. Look at the mass of produce he has without a market for it. I think he was foolish with all those sons to settle up here. True he has plenty of sheep, but they are all 'scrubbers'ï¿½in-and-in breed- ing, and over-stocking will never do, I can tell you that from experience. I shall bid you good-bye now until I see you again. I would like to have paid you for all the trouble I have given,' but I know you would not accept payment. However, give this to the men in the kitchen for Johnnie's clothes." 

 He handed a piece of paper to Mr. Attenborough, which turned out to be an order on the South Australian Bank for ï¿½20. It was badly written and worse spelled, but the men in the kitchen did not take a critical view of of it from that standpoint. When Dr. Drummond reached Mount Yatna, the first person he saw was Milmilty, and his first words to him were an inquiry for Pulee. Said Milmilty, "You come on ask me Bottle-brush. Me been tell you long time one devil catch him. What for you ask me? Me can't go along of Tintora; nobody been see me. What for white fellow stupid? Plenty devil sit down your place. He no belong to you; never mind; he all right now." "No, Milmilty, he is not all right. There may be Muldarbies and all sorts of evil spirits at Tintora, but they did not take the boy; neither did you for that matter, but you know who did, and helped to plan it. That is why I came to you. I told you he was to be sent away safely ; and that 

 is why he was carried off so soon. I will find it out, and shoot all those who had a hand in it. I see you know who did it, but you do not mean to tell me; and the first time I catch you at Tintora, I will tie you up, and thrash-you until you do tell me." Thereupon Milmilty walked off to his own people at the camp ; and there was a great deal of excited talk amongst them when they heard the reason of the doctor's visit and his threats of vengeance. The Winstanley's received the doctor kindly. He found young Stevenson in the drawing-room with Elsie, who looked flushed and pleased. "When my house is finished," he was saying, "you must come over to see me. I am having a lot of things sent from town and a dear old house- keeper, who will do all she can to make you comfortable. Karobie can come too, if you like to bring her." "Karobie is going to marry Mil- milty, so the old men say," said Elsie, "we shall miss her in the kitchen now her mother is getting so old." "Who is her mother?" "Why the black they call 'Mug- gins'; she with the sugar-loaf head." The doctor noted this conversation and it made him very ill at ease, but he managed to hide his feelings as he said. 'I wish, Stevenson, you would come back with me. I feel sure there is trouble hanging over us with the darkies. They are hidden about somewhere, you know. They have taken my little blackboyï¿½the one you made such fun ofï¿½I am sure they mean mischief. I wish Mr. Win- stanley would come too." Mr. Winstanley replied that he had heard some talk at the worlies, and that he and his sons would go to Tintora the next day. The doctor was not well pleased at the evident familiarity of young Stevenson with the Winstanleys, es- pecially as such a good understanding seemed to insist between Elsie and the young man. However he reflected that the position at Tintora demanded his present attention; so he hastened on with the preparations for returning and putting his friends in marching order. 

 After a long day's ride, they came in sight of the hills surrounding the head station, and saw several columns df smoke. These they were certain did not arise from bush fires but were the signals of many natives. "I think," said Mr. Winstanley, "there are several tribes there." (It was plain he feared more than he said) "Let us push along to reach them be- fore sunset." When nearing their destination, a horse came flying madly along with spears in his hind legs. Further along were dead sheep lying about, their legs broken, and evidently belonging to Ah Sin's flock. A visit to the Chinaman's hut showed that it was deserted; so they pushed on towards the head station. There they found the natives making a determined at- tack on the store. It was a strong building with an iron roof and had so far defied the efforts of the blacks. "Our people have shut themselves up in the store," cried the doctor, "let us rescue them at once." Then he gave orders to fire on the natives; and almost as soon as he spoke, bang, bang went the rifles, and the naked creatures began to drop. Presently Mr. Attenborough appeared with his arm in a sling. "They caught us unawares," he said, "early in the morning. We could not fire on them out of the store and all the ammunition was there. You cover us while we get out, and then we will be at them with you." In a few minutes only dead blacks were to be seen ; those who escaped the bullets having quickly decamped. Mr. Stevenson got a spear wound in his leg and took refuge in the store, where he found Mrs. Ah Sin and her husband. 

 The doctor and Mr. Winstanley fol- lowed the retreating blacks, but, flavored by the increasing darkness, they had all disappeared. "When did this begin, Atten- borough?" asked the doctor, on his return. "About eleven o'clock this morn- ing. Old Jones' son, who keeps the hut for his father, had just come in to tell us that he went out with the flock yesterday while his father stayed at home to cook. He brought the sheep home at sunset, and was met by a party of native men. They spoke a little Englishï¿½at least one did. He spoke to the lad, saying, 'all right, Johnnie, plenty supper along a camp- oven.' As it was quite dark, the lad wondered why his father did not come out to help yard the sheep; so he went in and struck a light. There was a fire lit on the camp-oven, and when he lifted the lid there lay his father's head chopped off with an axe. Then looking round, he saw the head- less body on the floor. The boy fled out into the darkness and came on hereï¿½it is fifteen miles, you knowï¿½ but overcome with fear he broke down on the way, and lay on the ground until daylight. Then he came on, but could see no signs of blacks any- where. Just as he was telling me the tale though, about a hundred rushed upon us, yelling horribly. We ran into the store for protection. After we had been there a few hours, Mrs. Ah Sin and her boy came into the station. The blacks were then busy carrying plunder out of the houses. We heard her cry out, and let her in with us. Afterwards Ah Sin himself came. He told us that his sheep had been attacked, and he had fled for his life. First he went to his hut, but as his wife and child had disappeared there was nothing left for him to do but to come to us. We in- tended to hold the store all day, as we knew the blacks would draw off at night; and then we proposed to go out armed and surprise them in turn." "That's just what we will still do," said Mr. Winstanley. "As you are wounded, you will remain here with some of the best men. The rest of us will go to the murdered man's hut, and I think there we shall find them and have revenge. The worst of it is, that even if we catch some alive, the truth can never be got out of a native." 

 A few blacks were caught at the camp and brought in with dog chains round their necks, but they either could not or would not speak. So the worst-looking pair were put in a cart and taken to the 15-mile hut and there hanged to a tree which grew close by; while the body of the white man was put in a wooden case and taken to Tintora. No natives could now be seen, but they left a trail of fire behind them. All the bush was in a blazeï¿½grass, scrub, and forest. Never before nor since did Dr. Drum- mond or Mr. Attenborough see such a conflagration. For days and weeks the great trees cracked and fell. Some giant eucalypti remained standing with their evergreen tops, although the fire had burnt out their insides, leaving the roots and bark intact to carry sap to the topmost branches and leaves. Many acres of open country appeared after that. Happily before the shifting winds could bring the fire round again, torrents of tropical rains fell and extinguished all but the smouldering logs. Then they gathered up the carcases of the dead blacks and burnt them, mustered the scattered sheep, cattle, and horses, and found the loss considerable. The spear-wound in Mr. Attenbo- rough's arm soon got well, but the mark bore testimony all his life, to his conflict with the wild men of Aus- tralia. Mr. Stevenson went wounded to Adelaide to be made a great fuss of by society ladies. He was the hero of the day. Mrs. Ah Sin declared that she dared not live at the outside huts, so she was permitted to take possession of the kitchen again, her husband being reinstalled as cook. The boy, whose father had been killed, came to work on the home station, and after- wards he went to Winstanley's, where strange to say he mixed with the natives and took more to their ways than any other white person.
