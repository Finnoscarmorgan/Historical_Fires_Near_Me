Lady Bridgeworth's Sin. 

 CHAPTER XXVII.� (Continued.) 

 ''I merely wrote that I must forbid him to attempt   to hold the smallest communication with my     grandchild or with myself, and that all and any letters coming from him would be immediately     returned unopened !''   ''And yon expected to receive a letter in the face     of such a command ?''   ''My dear Ferrars,'' the countess said, calmly,     ''a man in love takes no heed of commands ! Had   Humphrey Lascelles really loved this poor child, do 

 you think he would be where be is now ? Command or no command, he would have   forced his way here and demanded the right to be heard; but, you see, he does not come. He thinks, and he thinks wisely, his better course   is to accept my letter as final, whatever revulsion of feeling and social principle may come now,'' the old lady said, with a sneer. ''Now that he is aware of the child's proper status in society, even   he must feel that it will be a monstrously difficult   matter to explain away his letter on that account.'' Mr. Ferrars knit his brows.   ''And these others � this young clergyman and   his mother ? Is their testimony to go for nothing ?   Surely, they would not speak so strongly in Sir   Humphrey's favour unless they had reason to do   so.'' ''Ferrars, you are as obstinate as a mule !'' the     little countess cried, angrily ; then she calmed down. '' I have not thought it necessary to tell either Mrs. Griffiths or her son the whole truth.   The child could not rest until they had been writ- ten to. She is more than grateful to them. When she was ill those first few days after she came to me their names were never off her lips. I wrote to them fully on the subject of her birth and restora- tion to me, but I merely touched lightly on the   subject of the broken engagement. I said the matter was quite at an end, that Barbara would henceforth live her life with me, and that Sir Humphrey, by his own unworthiness, had made it   necessary that his very name should be banished out of her memory.''   ''And this is Mr. Griffiths' answer,'' Mr. Ferrars   observed, picking up a letter and reading from it slowly and carefully :     '' What we did for your grandchild we would have done for   the veriest beggar. We found her in sore trouble and need, and we ministered to that need. Barbara's love and gratitude to us can never be doubted by either mother or myself. The girl has grown into our hearts. It is a grief that we can no longer hope to see her ; but it is not our province or desire       to dispute your ladyship's wish on this point. You are her     natural and proper guardian, and from our hearts we thank Heaven that, by its merciful providence, the child has been   restored to her own   As yet, everything is s0 strange and new in connection with Barbara that you will forgive both my mother and myself if we hesitate to grasp your meaning to the fullest extent. You speak of a broken engagement, of au absolute separation, of Sir Humphrey's unworthiness in bringing this about. If the   possibility of a marriage between Barbara and Humphrey Lascelles is broken asunder at this late moment it will be almost a grief to us, who have, from the first, been the witnesses of the beautiful little romance and love-story which led them     so for on the path to human happiness ; but that you have found it imperative to change the future life of your grandchild, because of some unworthy or dishonourable act on Sir   Humphrey's part, I, for my part, can or will never believe.   ''I do not know whether your ladyship is personally acquainted with Humphrey Lascelles; if so, I am pure the acquaintance   must be of the most superficial diameter, for no living creature who had met or known this man could find it possible to harbour a single harsh thought against such a man or permit a doubt to grow, much less to live.     ''Humphrey Lascelles is a nobleman � noble of heart, pure of   mind, generous, honourable in nature, worthy to be the husband or friend of the proudest and greatest woman in the land. May I be permitted to send my mother's warmest love and my own deepest regards to Barbara ?   ''When she will come, and you will let her she will find her   friends rejoiced to see her again, though, at this moment, they cannot fail to be grieved over the accident which, while it gives her family and family love, robs her of that happy future which we had hoped was so near. ''With many apologies for writing at such length to your   ladyship, and enclosing an endorsed statement that Barbara has spoken most minutely and correctly on all points of her story with which I have been connected, pray consider me now and always, Lady Castleton, your obedient servant, OWEN GRIFFITHS.''   Mr. Ferrars took off his spectacles as he finished   reading, and rubbed the glasses vigorously.   ''A most straightforward and admirable letter     in every sense of the word, Lady Castleton !' he   said.   ''The countess did not answer at first. Owen's   emphatic testimony to Humphrey Lascelles's   unblemished character had touched her more than   she cared to confess to Mr. Ferrars.   ''For a man who writes his own sermons no doubt     the letter is not bad, she observed.   The lawyer tapped the table with his spectacle   case.     ''I wish, my dear friend,'' he said, speaking with     a familiarity that his long close connection with   Lady Castleton warranted, ''that you would let     me sift this matter to the bottom.''   ''I have given my word of honour to the child   I will not move a finger in it one way or the   other !''   ''But, heaven bless my soul ! is she to be allowed     to die of a broken heart, all because of some child-   ish nonsense ?''   ''People don't die of broken hearts, my good     Ferrars,'' Lady Castleton answered, but she winced   at the words all the same.   Had not her experience in life taught her many   a lesson that gave the lie direct to these words ?   Had not her own Margaret gone to her grave the   victim of a heart-sorrow against which she could   not live ?   The old lady's face grew pale. The vision of   Barbara's young loveliness flashed before her.   What if the girl were to follow in her mother's   footsteps ? What if, despite her pride, her feeble     bodily strength � and alas ! alas ! there was no   gainsaying that the strength was only too frail �     should bow and break beneath that proud deter-   mination?     Lady Castleton's lips closed firmly together.   ''The question is a difficult one to solve,'' she said to herself more than to the lawyer. Her voice was low and not quite steady, and her face wore an     anxious air.   The force of Mr. Ferrars' argument could not be   put on one side.- It was not just, not fair, that   Humphrey Lascelles should be denied a chance of   explaining himself; and though she had scarcely ,   confessed it even to herself, Lady Castleton had   been touched and impressed by Owen Griffiths's   most firm and earnest testimony on the young   man's behalf. But she had given Barbara her   solemn promise. The girl's eager, almost passionate   entreaty that the matter should be allowed to rest   had won a vow that it should be exactly as the   the child wished.   Could she go back from that promise? Mr. Ferrars was silent a moment or two. Then he spoke.   ''Has Miss Vereker seen this ?'' he asked, touchng     Owen's letter.     Lady Castleton shook her head.   ''No !'' Mr. Ferrars pursed up his lips, then shut away   his spectacles with a click, and rose to his feet. He   nodded his grey head once or twice sagely.   ''There is the solution to the problem,'' he said,     shrewdly. Let her read that letter as soon as possible.''   ''You make me very angry, Ferrars,'' Lady       Castleton said irritably, ''and I cannot understand     how a sharp, clever man like you can take up such a decided side with a person whom you know little   or nothing about; or rather, I should say, about whom you know, through me, so much that is dis- agreeable and objectionable. Talk of women being obstinate and prejudiced !''    

 Mr. Ferrars entiled faintly.   ''I think there is certainly a little prejudice in the matter,'' he said, and he spoke in an apologetic sort of way; not in the least, however, deceiving Lady Castleton, who knew that the prejudice he alluded to was on her side and not on his. ''But,   for all that, my lady, I should like to give every body the benefit of a doubt, and so--�'' ''And so,'' Lady Castleton finished sharply, '' you desire that the child should read this letter ?'' Mr. Ferrars nodded his head, and then prepared to take his departure. He had come down from London the evening before, and had stayed the night at Coombe, but was off again now, for busi- ness was very brisk with Ferrars and Stangate, of Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. Lady Castleton rocked her chair to and fro for a moment. ''Well,'' she said, after a long pause�''well, I     will do as you advise, though it goes to my heart to upset the child just as she is beginning to get over things a little. I don't see that I shall do any good; for even if she consents to let you examine more closely into the matter, what better are we ? Can we give her back her belief, her happiness� eh, Ferrars ? Tell me that !'' '' It is my belief we can and shall do all that,'' was Mr. Ferrars's answer, given steadily and very quietly. He smiled at the old lady's expression, and then he moved to the window and looked out. ''They are very good friends,'' he said, with a nod   at two figures that passed up the avenue at that moment on horseback. 'The boy is quite happy with his new playmate.'' Lady Castleton ceased rocking her chair and rose from it slowly. '' Bertie will be the best friend the child can ever have,'' she said a little tremulously, and then she sighed. She was not young now, and the intricacies and heart sorrows of life were not to be so lightly attacked as in bygone years. If the thought of Barbara's lovely white face made her heart wince, the dread of the sadness that might be in store for her boy through that same lovely, girlish face, gave her just as keen a pain. She had guessed his secret from the first; and when all was told and proved, and she knew at last it was her Margaret's child that lay, in truth and indeed, upon her heart, the memory of the boy's   love came back to her, gilded with a rosy hue that made it altogether beautiful and desirable in her eyes. If she gave justice to Humphrey Lascelles, if she let him exonerate himself (were such a thing possible), though she might see the light and joy of life come into Barbara's face, would she not see it fade and die out of her beloved boy's eyes ? It was a painfui moment, and Lady Castleton felt that it was beyond her. She faltered, how- ever, only for that moment ; and as Mr. Ferrars left her, and she was alone, she stood and looked down on Owen Griffith's letter, and she set her lips firmly. ''I have been wrong,'' she said to herself. '' In   my anger and horror I shut out justice from my thoughts. I will not urge the child nor force my own feelings upon her. She shall read what this   good man says. If, when she reads, she should feel a desire to let Lascelles make some explanation, I will set about arranging this, even though my Bertie's heart must suffer the greatest pain a man may know.''   And when the door opened again to admit the two young people � Lord Castleton laughing, hand- some, eager ; Barbara wan, lovely, smiling faintly at her companion's chatter � the old lady was firm in her determination that justice should, after all, be meted out to this man ; even though justice should carry misery in its wings to one who was as dear to her � nay, dearer than her own life ! CHAPTER XXVIII. Lord Castleton was very restless. He had smoked at least three cigarettes, and had walked up and down the length of the conservatory a dozen times, and still Barbara did not come. She had promised to join him immediately. Grandmother had sent for her after dinner, but she would not keep the girl very long, and then they could sit here in the soft light and the warm, scented air. The earl was a little troubled about his cousin ; he had never been able to quite understand the matter of her broken engagement. He had seen a good deal of Humphrey Lascelles, and the absolute devotion and happiness that had existed between Barbara and her lover had been productive of many an envi- ous pang in his breast. That this bond could have been broken, and broken so effectively, was at first more than he could believe ; and, but for Barbara's wan looks, and the fact that she was here at   Coombe along with grannie and himself, and not even the faintest sign of Humphrey Lascelles any where, he could scarcely believe it even now. He asked no questions ; but he had thought a good deal about the subject ; and the memory of that night in the street, when he had come upon Barbara so unexpectedly, always gave him an un- easy feeling. She had said s0 little to him, only that she must go away from Lady Bridgeworth's house at once � at once � that she would let him help her, for she felt he was her friend ; and then he would never forget the broken cry she gave when he spoke Humphrey's name, and how she had said, quickly, firmly, that she would never willingly hear that name again, that Humphrey Lascelles was gone out of her life as utterly as though he were dead. Lord Castleton had spoken a little with his grandmother on this subject, and, though he had asked no questions, he could not quite disguise a natural curiosity about the matter. He learned nothing from his grandmother but the information that Barbara had been shamefully treated, and   that henceforth all possible or probable connection between herself and Lascelles was at an end. ''Then Barbara is free ?'' the young man had   said, with a flutter at his heart, and a leaping 'in his pulses. ''Quite free ?''   ''She is quite free,'' Lady Castleton said, in   reply, and a glance at the boy's face, with its eager flush and downcast eyes, gave her a pleasure and a pain. '' If it could be !'' she had thought, but there had come a doubt. He was so young ! Such a boy ! And Barbara, though she was so young, had suffered more in one year than he had done in all his bright, young life. The bolt that had shot into her heart would not soon be withdrawn. If a girl in years, the old woman's heart knew that Barbara loved with no girl's love. Something of this knowledge seemed to have come to Lord Castleton of late. It was not her beauty or her sorrow that made the gulf so wide between his cousin and himself. It was the feeling that her affection for him, genuine, sincere, deepening as it was every day � was not, would never be the love that he had for her. And yet such is the blindness of human nature, that, despite this knowledge, his hope grew and grew every day, and his dreams- were all of Barbara and the future when Barbara should be his wife � his very own.

Yet the attendance was far belot7 what the merits of the entertainment deserved, but this reason for complaint will pro bably be remedied to-night. Mr. Hyland does not lay claim to possessing a gigantic aggregation of talent in his combination, and does not try with oufcaide ostentation to make up for inside deficiency. His company is not large, bub each and every one is w(ll up to the business It is the trained ponies which form the great feature of the show, and of ? these Mr. Hylnnd has fourteen or fifteen magnifi cent specimens, ortam? onri piebalds predominating, and the fine condition they were in excited vonder. The ease, readiness, and gracefulness displayed by these animals in response to Mr. Hjland's slightest word or sign evoked much admiration and-appiause. The intelligence displayed by one little fellow, Sovereign, was almost incredible, and he found a planted handkerchief far more easily than many trained dogs. He also played a game of euchre, vhilft others iipparently enjoyed themselves at see-ssw, daucing, etc. At a word of command from their owner the ? six cream ponies went down as if dead, their fore and hind legs were tied together, and then at another command Sovereign, who was among their number, ireed himself and unloosed the fastenings of his companions with his teeth. He wound up by leading the others one by one from the ring. The riding of Miss Hyland, who is a splendid looking wom.in, on four horses was loudly applauded, and her younger sister also rode, tumbled, and walked the invisible wire nicely. Master Hyland and the juvenile clowns were suffer ing from influenza, but the former is a grand young horseman, who popped his two barebacked chargers over high leaps in reckless style, and the clowns kept the fun rolling. As may be noted by adver tisement, Mr. Hyland intends to give a change of prognimme this evening, when it is hoped the enter tainment will be well patronised. By the way, the tent in which the performance takes place has some what of a history: in it were conducted the first Church of England and Roman Catholic services ever held at the TVyalong goldfield, aiid it also served the purpose there of the Warden's office and a polling booth. The Professor dealt liberally with the miners there, and he was a great favourite with them. If you cannot obtain ' My fa Tea' in your district write to D. Mitchell and Co., Carence-street, Sydney, who will arrange for a supply at once through the local storekeeper The Lakgs Pdblic School. � A change has been made in this institution. Mr. T. E. Pyman, late head teacher of the Rnthbury Public School, ? has been appointed head teacher at Largs. Mr. Pyman has been nearly six years at Rcthbury, and ?we congratulate him on his translation to Largs. He was liked by both parents and pupils, having won the affection of all, who, while rejoining in his promotion, regretted that he was removing from among themselves. We are assured by a resident of the locality that Mr. Pyman will only need to bti known by the residents at Largs to be appreciated. Mr. C. Mansfield , late teacher at Largs, takes charge of the school at Bothbvry. Bunevolent Bacteria. � It is estimated that there are 55,000 microbes per cubic metre in the at mosphere of the Rue de Rivoli. ' How amiable,' remarks the Gaulois, ' these little creatures must be when, notwithstanding their enormous numbers, they allow us to go arid come, to eat and drink, and . to live so long '.' We heartily recommend ARNOTT'S MILK ARROWROOT BISCUITS for Children. 583 More Bush Fires. � Tho weather to-day was again very boisterous, a strong westerly wind com mencing to blow about eleven' o'clock and increas ing in velocity as the. day wore on. With the sun shining strongly the day was unpleasantly hot and altogether most disagreeable. Bush fireB in various parts of the district which continued burning slowly during the absence of wind, were again fanned into the fierceness experienced last week, and dense volumeB of Bmoke could be plainly seen rising in the direction of Ceesnock and Farley, and away towards Mount Vincent. Some of the grass pad docks at Rutherford and Farley took fire tliis afternoon, and a large quantity of grass was destroyed. Fires were burning along both sides of the railway line above Farley. Yesterday Mr. E. W. Sparke's paddock at Rutherford was on fire, but the flames were happily extinguished before much damage was done. A Singular Scenb. � Near to where the famous detective Eossignol lives in solitary retirement in his house-boat on the Marne a singular scene has just been witnessed. There ia a military swimming school at Nogent, the students at which, on the occasion of the visit of the Inspector- General Gallimard, gnve a curious display. Thirty of the monitors were, drawn up on the banks of the river in full marching order. The command was given to them to cross the Marne, whereupon they all plunged iuto the stream. For a few seconds there was aothiDg but bubbles to mark the place of their immersion. Presently a patch of blue, a streak of red, or a gleam of steel emerged from the water, and then one sa.v thirty kepis, grouped in the form of a triangle, imitating the flight of swallows, forging their way ahead, and leaving behind them a track of foam. Some of the swimmers did not pause to remove their great coats or packs, but others quickly strapped them together, and pushed this species of raft before them as they swam. All the men carried their Lebel rifles in their shoulder baits. Some critics objected to the fact that the cartridges were not placed in the kepis, but to this the answer is mnde that the cartridges have enve lopes sufficiently watertight to render a couple of honrs' immersion of no consequence whatever. The English Mails.� Albany, SaLurday.� The R.M.S. Massilio, R. Harvey commander, arrived f.om Colombo at 10 30 p.m. yesterday. Following is the list of her passengers for Sydney : Measis.
