 CHAPTER XI.-COLLECTING THE CRUMBS. 

 The demise of Mr. King brought about the departure of his family from the scene of oar narrative. Even if that gentleman had lived, the devastation wrought by the fire would probably for a time at least, necessi tated a change of venue on their part; for the Kolkibertoo run was swept from boundary to boundary; not a blade of grass or a twig of herbage was left, and the homestead itself was reduced to a pile of ashes. So when a sufficient time had elapsed to admit of Laura's recovery from the severe attack she had received at the lagoon ford, the family, with Miss Stretch, took their departure for Melbourne under the protection of Dr. Frayne, who undertook the reponsibility in order tbat Frank Axford might remain with Leo to complete his- holidays. Charley Kin" was the .only one of the family who showed any.inclination to regret the change from bush to town life, and Mr. Morton, seeing behind the .lad's somewhat precocious spirits a wealth, of honest, useful energy, offered him a position at Wyalong, where he could gain .exporience and fit himself to make a proper use of the money .which lie would inherit on reaching his majority. This offer :was accepted, and having a master who did not curb his keenness, Charley .soon established a reputation as a olear-hoaded, dashing fellow, whose name . would some day command respect in financial circles. 

 Neit to Kolkibertoo, Yarrangobilly run suffered most by the disasters of the 7tli. The inhabitants of N , . who by prodigious efforts saved their township from destruction1! were unable to check the fire as it swept down- upon Martin Devine's run, and with the exception of one paddock which was bounded by a marsh of green reeds, the whole of his" pasturage was destroyed. In this, paddock he managed to save all his live* stock, so that his loss, though heavy, was not disastrous. But it was another check to the prosperity which ho had been so often on the eve of attaining, and as tho continual dropping wears away the stone, so Martin's determination at last began to yeild to the' continued persecutions 

 of the fates. 

 " It's no use I" he soliliquised, as lie rode homewards with an open letter in. his hand after receiving his mail; " I shall never clear the mortgage off this property. I can't make it out! All my calculations seem .accurate! Everybody gives me credit for being a business man, and yet some draw back, which has not been' allowed for always turns up just as my ends seemod to be gained. There was the carrying business in Geelong, .a.grand success that woa, but my' beastly luck must .?give me a wife to send tho whole thing up a tree. As for Yarran gobilly-as far as man could see, about as neat and sure an investment as ever money was sunk in-it - has been a succession of misfortunes and disappointments. First of all I handicap myself with a considerable mortgage, and just ;as I begin to reduce it the people of N reduce my income by taking a'common outof the pick of my grass land. I get over this loss by erecting a store and punt, and after fighting through a couple of dry seasons I am brought to the verge of ruin by ' selectors. By apiece of good fortune I get rid of these, and am beginning to fancy myself a bit, when down sweeps a bush-fire to take the conceit out of me. ' I raise a further loan to pay for feed for 'my stock until, my own grass grows 'again and now I get a letter from Govern ment notifying their intention to build a bridge across tho Marray, a quarter of a mile below the present crossing. That means of course, that the punt is useless, that my store is not worth the ground it stands on, and if all this is not enough to make a man swear, then a man must be an angel, that's what's the matter 1" 

 Whether Morton was another sample of the rash enthusiast who, being led away by figures and- theories which look well on paper, but . which fall short the promise in their practical issues, loss their money, or whether the fates really did exercise their powers against him, may be a mattor of opinion ; certainly it did seem as though lie was never to make his fortune on Yarrangobilly; and considering the state of mind disclosed by the above soliloquy, it is not surprising that "when, three months later, Mr. Moreton offered him a reasonable price for his run the offer -was accepted. Martin did not come out so badly after all, for after selling the stock, and . " squaring up," ho found himself - in possession of �6000. He determined that he and Rose Bhould spend �1000 of this money in a trip to England, on returning from which he would setble down to.some steady business. He was a man of action, and three weeks after arriving at this decision ho and Rose, With Professor Olqtz, who was on his way to Germany to astound the Twenty Six Letter Learned Society with wonderful facts relating to Australian .marsupials, steamed out of Hobson's Bay] and . left behind tliem the fair summer land which they had learned to love. 

 Yes, the ''master of Wyalong bought Yarrangobilly, and it. was ominous of some enterprising purpose on the part of that gentleman that, shortly aftor, when Goonambool, the property of the late Horace Mayne, was brought to the hammer, it was knocked down to Mr. Henry Morton. In fact, a remarkable change has come over the tenor of Mr. Morton's life. The latent energy which he had been nursing all these years in retirement seemed to have burst 

 forth with renewed vigor, and he is display ing spirit of enterprise such as few gave him ovedit for. Such a change does not take place iu a man's manner of existence with out a cause, and we Bhall get at the root of Mr, Sloretoii's sudden metamorphosis by reviewing a conversation which took place wtweeu him and Dr. Frayne a fortnight 

 j subsequent to the receipt.of the following 

 note: , T\\ 

 �H. Morton, Esq., Wyalong. Deak Snt,-Some strange statements which, � true, should be of great importance to you, have been made to myself and brother officers by the patient who was sent here from your station. The man is now quite conscious and rational, and wishes to see vou. He says that if I mention his name, Ralf Lamont, you will be certain to_come. I am, Sir, your's truly, ?, M.D., Beech worth Hospital; he was absent from his home a fortnight, and it was on the evening of his return as they sat together, on the verandah, that the conversation above referred to passed between himself and Ur. 

 F',Xw, Henry, tell me all about it. 

 Your letter was a hasty affair, and now I want to hear the whole story from the beginning to the end." _ > 

 Mr. Moroton put aside his pipe. " Very well, old fellow, I'll begin at the beginning. 

 " As you are aware, my father, Oolonel Morton, designed that I should enter the army, but in order that! might first gaiu some sort of business experience, I took a position in a bank. ' By dint of some ability and a great deal of influenoe, I attained m ei�btoeh months to the position of teller, which position I occupied at the time of my misfortune. It was part of-my business at times, when I got togetlier �100 worth of silver, to tie it in a bag, for transmission to such branch-banks aa required the cash; and it was my custom, on collecting the necessary dmounfc� to place it in the teller s safe in the strong room. I sent away these ba�s several times during the week, as a general rule. One day, whilst I was in his room, the manager told me that complaints had come in from two of the branch banks 

 to the effect that the money received in j their bags was short of the right amount by | several pounds. He. warned me to be 

 careful for the future, and intimated that I the deficiency would be deducted from my salary. Of coui-30 no blame could reason ably fall upon mo, because I had an unlimited supply of money from my father ; besides, although I mixed in society usually above the reach of bank officials, and lived up to that society, I was not what is called a fast man. However, I folt a little hurt over the matter, and my suspicions fell upon a. young fellow in the bank, an exchange clerk. I resolved to prove whether my suspicious were correct, so, on the following day, I put the bags of money in the safo and left the door open as usual; then, when the exchange clerk came in, I left the room, came back as he went out, counted tho cash and found it all right. I left the door open still,-keeping watch, as I worked, and sent the bags away in the , 

 afternoon, resolved upon a further test on | tho following day. But next morning on entering the bank I received a note stating that various sums, amounting in all to �50, were missing from the bags sent out the previous afternoon, and intimating that my servioes would be dispensed with for the future. Had I been wise I should have left 

 forthwith, and no doubt the whole thing! would have been hushed up for.good ; but I was young and impetuous. I would not submit to the suspicions which so sudden a dismissal must necessarily oreate, and I gave tho matter such publicity that tho manager, for the credit of the bank, was forced to place the matter in the hands of the detectives. 

 Heaven only knows how these ferrits I managed it, but they worked up such a case 

 against me, that I was found guilty of] 

 embezzlement, and the judge, taking the only course open to him, sentenced me to transportation for the shortest term allowed by law. My father,, who never doubted my innocence, was BO cut up by what he called my " pig-headed persistency" in refusing to hush the matter up whilst there was time, that he refused to see me before I left England. He declared that, for the sake of a romantic fancy, I had polluted the honor o� my family, and, though I wrote to him constantly after my arrival in Australia, he never answered my letters until just before his death, wheu he notified his intention of leaving me �10,000, and expressed his regret for the coldnes he 

 .had shown towards me. 

 << Well, you know how I utilized those ten thousand pounds ; how that I bought Wyalong in its wild, unfenoed state, and have quietly improved ik into a property worth nearly �200,000, if it is worth a penny ; and it is only now, after all these 

 years of solitude, that the man Ralf j 

 Lamont, who was a ledgerkeeper in the bank wi.h me, comes forth to confess him self guilty of the theft for which I have suffered. _ Thank Heaven I-.can now look the world in the face without fear, for I have in my pocket, at this moment, proofs of my innocence strong enough to satisfy 

 the most incredulous." 

 Dr. Frayne was greatly excited; he could scarcely refrain from shouting out for sheer joy, -and ;his kindly eyes danced and twinkled over the rims of-his spectacles, in a way they had never done before. 

 "Shall you carry those proofs to England ? " he asked. 

 " I hope 'Irshall-; but not yet. Leo will | 

 remain in. Melbourne for 12 or 18 months 

 yet, at the end of which time he will be old enough to commence the business of life as his own master. It is my intention that he should start well, that is,; with sufficient property and responsibly to keep his 

 energies in a healthy, vigorous state. 11 

 shall put together enough property round about here to give him full employment; then, when he leaves his studies to enter upon more weighty duties, you and I, old fellow, will pack up our swags and set our faces for Old England, not to stay there, hut to rejuvenate in the scenes of old." 

 So, month after month, Mr. Morton went' on adding to his pastoral holdings, and Leo remained in Melbourne. .� 

 The latter had long since outlived his sudden and romantic passion for Laura King. It was moroly a boy's first love, a little more ardent than is usually the oase, owing to tho exceptional circumstances under which his nature had been schooled ; and when Frank and Laura terminated a long standing engagement in tbe temple of Hymen he wag able to avtendthe osremony, 

 I s conscientious and as ardent a well-wisher 

 s the bride and groom could boast of. At he end of a year subsequent to the fire, 

 which virtually brought our atory to a close, he returned to the bush, and entered into hia father's plans with an aptitude and energy which justified Mr. Morton and Dr. Frayne in starting for "Old England," hopeful, and confident of his sucoess. 

 I * * # * 

 ( Yon and I, reader, live in an age of , freedom and unshackled thought; an age ! to jump from the grave to the facetious when sauce for the goose is held to be sauce for the gander; and, if a thousand authors and a million readers take pro ; digious leaps oyer time and space, why may not we also, in a second of time, leave years 

 behind us ? ' 

 If, four years later, wo return, to the scene of our narrative, we find Mr. Morton and Dr. Frayne once more established at Wyalong. Leo, who lives at. Goonambool with his wife, Eva, has grown into prominence amongst the "nabobs" of Australia, as the senior partner in the firm ot " Morton and King." This partnership, is a great success.Charley's . dashing spirit and bold vonturesome, ever ready to " plunge," is nicely* balanced by the sound common-sense of Leo's firm judgment. Charley takes his fences .with a fearless rtsh ; Loo never flinches, but, holding , the reins firmly, measures; ? the distance deliberately, and, if he strikes at all, it is the rail that:oomes down-not the horse. 

 [ Charley rides the racer; Leo the hack ; but [ it is Charley who faces the hurly-burly of I the oven-lands in the interior, where lean 

 faced men struggle with the droughts, and blacks, and hardships which no pen can picture ; it was Charley who opened up and' stocked 1G00 miles of back block country, 

 and who came back, bearded and grizzled,, to show the hungry bankers, in his lauthorn jaws and weedy limbs, what it had cost him 

 to become a millionaire. 

 Leo and Eva were thinking of the return of their dashing partner one spi'ing evening, as they sat in the'vorandah at Goonambool, looking out on the peaceful suaset and the gleams of lake Boal in the distance. Eva thought how she would coax, and pet, and fatten him back to the vigorous youth, which had oozed from him by waterless rivers in the solitary wilderness; Leo thought how he would persuade, nay, force' his partner to Bettle down, and live like a white man for the remainder of his life. 

 A horseman arrived from N-->., and handed Leo a telegram daled from a dis tant township: " Six inches of rain old boy. Bogged to the axles, as I left the run. Been travelling a week, and shall be with vou in four or five days. Worked out. 

 Had enough of it 

 -CHARLES KING."
