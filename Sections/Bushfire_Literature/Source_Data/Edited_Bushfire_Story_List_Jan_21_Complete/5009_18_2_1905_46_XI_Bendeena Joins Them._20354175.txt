 WYREEMA. 

 CHAPTER XI.�Bendeena Joins Them. 

 By "Bulloo" (Author of "Gurramon," "Nara- ponga," &c). 

 What are you going to do now?" demanded Moomera. "We are going back to the island to get some weapons we had left there 

 �there are plenty of them�and then will make another start for the South. It would take us too long to become expert with native weapons, and we would fall an easy victim to any half dozen blacks we met with if we had no weapons." "That's true," said the Chief, and a sudden thought striking him he continued: "Why not collect a few of my men and teach them how to use the firearms. We would be more than a match for ten times the number of Yidinjis, so that we could go down the coast and give them a proper thrash- ing." In his excitement the Chief sprang to his feet and with wild gesticula- tions described how he would creep up to the various camps of the enemy one after the other and exterminate them. But Jack was not to be persuaded. His mission was not to exterminate any particular tribe of the aborigines, and he told the Chief in unmistakable terms that he would not be a party to it. "I tell you what I'll do, though," he continued. "You've been a brick to us, and if you like to accompany us to the island I'll give you a gun or rifle with all the ammunition we can spare, and teach you how to use it. This will give you great power, and may help you to restore your tribe to some of its former prestige." The Chief saw at a glance there was nothing to lose and a great deal to gain in the proposition, and warmly accepted Jack's offer. The sea was too rough for the next three days for them to resume their journey, for although it invariably calmed down during the night the wind rose during the day, and they knew those conditions would obtain as long as the wind blew from the same quarter. At length the water became favour- able, and the lads paddled half a mile or so out to sea, while the others kept abreast of them on the land until they reached the scene of the battle, where Moomera and his family procured a canoe and rejoined their white friends. The Chief landed first and made an exhaustive search for tracks in the vicinity of the cave, but found no one had visited that part of the island since the ship had been refloated, when at a signal the others came ashore. The canoes were hidden in the bushes, and the lads approached the entrance of the cave. Wishing to maintain the mystery with which the cave was surrounded the lads, according to a previously ar- ranged plan, walked up to it from op- posite sides, Jack chanting "Hokey, pokey, winkey wum, how d'you like your taters done? I like 'em with their jackets on, said the King of the Cannibal Islands," Will intoning at every two or three words "winkey wum." They then paused at the brink of the opening and joining their hands over their heads made three deep obeisances. The spirits being propitiated the lads descended, in a few minutes returning with rifles, re- volvers, ammunition, tomahawks, knives, and a pot each of jam and treacle. The blacks had been duly impressed with the mystic rites, and before they would eat the jam Moomera inquired if Jack was sure it would not harm them. "It would be a heap better," said Jack next morning, "if we could pro- cure a canoe large enough to carry us all." "We don't require it," said Will. "The Chief and his family will leave us as soon as he has acquired the use of his gun." "I've been thinking he may help us to get the ship out of the creek," replied Jack, who never lost sight of anything he wished to accomplish. "Then why not get some of his men to give us a hand?" said Will. "I've thought of that, too," replied his brother, "but although I would trust Moomera to a considerable ex- tent I should not care to place our- selves in the hands of his tribe." "But they would have nothing to gain by killing us," said Will. "Oh yes they would, they would get our weapons, and Moomera could teach them how to use them." "My word, you're right, I suppose we must do without them." At that moment Moomera came up to their fire and Jack said: 

 "We want you to help us in a cer- tain project we have in view in re- turn for the gun and ammunition we are giving you." "Name it," was the reply. Jack then unfolded his scheme of getting the Wyreema out of the creek. "I'm with you," replied the Chief, adding, "but if the Yidinjis find us out we'll be killed. Why not call some of my men and go down in force?" "We have nothing to offer them in return," said the lad. "Give them some of your guns and they will be amply repaid." "We require them all for our- selves," replied Jack. "We shall keep them all loaded so as to be discharged quickly by ourselves if we are attacked." "Very well," said Moomera, "I will go with you, and if those mangy din- goes attack us we'll provide the ma- terial for a grand funeral amongst them." "Do you think we could make a canoe big enough to hold us all?" in- quired Will. "It would be pleasanter travelling, besides being safer." "We could get a tree on the main- land that would serve the purpose," replied the Chief. "We don't make large canoes because we find the small ones handier, and we never go any distance on the water." "That's just what we want," cried Jack. "Come on, Chief, let's get over as quickly as possible. We'll make the canoe and then come back to the cave for the things we want to take with us." Although the blacks dislike doing anything in a hurry Moomera was stirred by Jack's enthusiasm, so that in less than an hour the party had embarked, carrying, amongst other things, adzes and axes for hollowing out the canoe. Every mile or two the lads and the blacks took a turn at the paddles, Boorna being more expert than the white lads, although the latter did very well. During the passage Moomera, who had evidently been turning their pro- ject carefully over in his mind, said: "Will you be able to sail the ves- sel by yourselves after you bring her out of the creek?" "We'll have to," replied Jack. "I don't suppose you will care to come down the coast with us. We'll be only too glad if you will, and will give you as many things as you like in the way of blankets and tomahawks to bring back with you." "But how could I get back?" "We'll send you by the first vessel coming this way, and will pay the captain to land you at any place you choose." "That sounds good, but I don't care about it. Your captain might take your money and put me ashore on some island. Ships don't come close in here. Your ship was miles closer to the coast than she ought to have been." "The captains are not rogues," re- plied the lad. "But here is another plan. I've taken a great fancy to the country I've seen on this part of the coast, and if you come as far as Bris- bane with us and wait there for a few weeks till we can purchase cattle you can come back with us over- land." "What should I do with Boorna and the pickaninnies?" demanded Moomera. "Keep them there too, or leave them here until we return." "No," said the Chief, "that won't do. What I was going to propose is this. Let us get Bendeena, my blood brother, and when we have helped you out of the creek with the ship we will return in the big canoe." The matter was further discussed, and Jack endeavoured to persuade Chief to accompany them without his bloodbrother, but failed to shake his determination, and finally agreed to his seeking Bendeena, realising how useful his assistance would be. As Moomera would not go near the spot where his friends had been mas- sacred they landed a mile further up the coast, and the men immediately set about finding a suitable tree for the canoe, while Boorna gathered ma- terial for two gunyahs. She would have begun building them, but the Chief said they might not find a tree handy, and would perhaps have to form a new camp. But the Chief thought he had seen a tree not far off which was large enough, and led the lads straight to the spot, pointing with satisfaction to a straight tree about three feet in diameter at the base. Jack saw with great satisfaction that a large portion of the interior wood had been burnt out by a bush-fire, and laying their 

 firearms on the ground, he and Moo- mera commenced to fell it. Neither was Will idle, for he went in search of game, abiding carefully by his brother's instructions to keep in open country. Before sundown the tree had fallen with a grinding crash that echoed through the stems of its lofty mates, causing the nearest to shiver as if in apprehension of a similar fate. Having fixed the log in a proper position and marked out the lines for hollowing, the Chief and his family departed at sunrise in search of Bendeena. Knowing that his people would not be found far away from the ranges, the Chief made straight for them, and having arrived at the foothills, or ridges as they are generally termed, pursued a course parallel to them, walking rapidly, having arranged for Boorna to meet him at a certain waterhole in the evening. Although covering the ground at a pace which would have tried a white man to compete with, no fresh sign escaped the Chiefs eye, while he fre- quently stamped on the ground to leave a clear impress of his foot, at the same time dropping a small stick, bearing certain signs. By midnight the Chief had walked twenty miles without having observ- ed a track fresh enough to render it worth while following. He then sought for a hollow box tree, and having filled its space with dry grass and green boughs set it alight. In a few minutes a volume of brown smoke was shooting skyward, and having made a conspicuous mark on a gum tree close by, he again followed a northward course. When he had gone about ten miles Moomera stopped, and hav- ing stamped his feet in describing a small circle, returned to the burning box tree. The latter had fallen, and was nearly consumed, but a little 

 smoke still rose from the smouldering remainder. It was quite dark when the Chief reached the small waterhole in the ridges at which Boorna was camped, having walked about forty-five miles since he left the lads. The gin had covered about twenty, carrying the children turn about. The following day was spent in hunting, for the Chief knew his smoke signal would be inspected by some of his tribe, and if he left the waterhole he might miss the very man he was so anxious to find. Game was not very plentiful in the ridges, but there were not many mouths to fill, so that when he re- turned to the bosom of his family at dusk bearing two wallabies and a goanna he was quite satisfied. Boorna had also been foraging, and pointed to a quantity of wood-duck's eggs she had found in a hollow tree not very far away. Darkness closed in upon the little camp, the kookooburras had given their last chorus to a moribund day, and Moomera lay back on his rug as his youngest pickaninny scrambled on to his breast. Overhead sailed the moon nearly at the full, small fleecy clouds flying inland across her face to tell the drought stricken interior that copious rains were at hand. A gray muzzled 'possum, regardless, or ignorant of the fact that his deadliest enemies were within hearing, uttered his harsh and indescribable cry. Little Corella, Moomera's eldest boy, sprang to his feet, and seizing one of his father's nullas, advanced with valiant air, but having reached the limit of the fire's illumination, paused, and as an owl flitted by with rustling wing, fled back to Moomera's side. The camp lying in a line between a creek and a large lagoon, flocks of waterfowl were flying overhead all 

 through the night, their various cries and the sounds made by their wings telling the Chief as plainly as if he had seen them what families they be- longed to. "Hear the swans," he said to the little boys. "That was the leader of the flight asking if they were all there, and the reply of the hindmost bird that they were all there and getting along all right. If it were daylight you would see them flying in a V form with their long necks stretched out straight before them. If there was a droop or a bend in their necks it would tell you they are get- ting tired, and would not fly much further, although they would never descend voluntarily except into water. They would fall from exhaustion be- fore they would alight on dry land. "There goes a flock of teal. They have no leader. Every little drake thinks he is the best man, and the leading bird is changed as one of the others pushes to the front. "Do you know what that harsh konk is? Don't you know that yet? You'll never make a great hunter if you don't take more notice. That is a flock of wild geese, those ungainly black and white birds you see in the trees surrounding a lagoon, or some- times in the water. Their feet are half webbed. Their windpipes are longer than the outer skin, and have a kink in them, perhaps that is why they make such a funny noise. "Ha, here comes a mob of five black ducks. Phew, didn't they whiz past. No konking or quacking about them. Heads pointing stiffly for- ward, little feet tucked out of sight, every muscle strained to take them to their journey's end. They are tra- velling more than a mile a minute, and may go for hours. When you have arrived at the proper age, Corella, and have been inducted into certain rites, you will be permitted to kill and eat 

 those juicy birds, and later on to seek for, and eat their eggs. Until then they are taboo, and as you have been told before, if you eat even one egg or a little bit of the birds, the evil spirits would en- ter the camp at night, and you would never be seen any more, the only clue to your disappearance being your blood on the grass indicating how they had torn you in little pieces and eaten you while they were flying away." The boy snuggled shudderingly close to his mother, who was lying curled up in the bough gunyah. The young- er pickaninny had already fallen asleep, so gently laying him down, the Chief pushed the ends of the fire- sticks together, and in a few minutes was oblivious to his surroundings. Now was the time for a prowling dingo to enter the camp in search of scraps, and one hungry individual essayed to do so, but he met with such a warm reception from the camp dogs that he departed hurriedly poor- er by several tufts of yellow hair than when he appeared. Moomera kept in the vicinity of the camp the next day, and decided to move further north if he did not meet with some of his friends, and ascer- tain Bendeena's whereabouts, but late in the afternoon he struck fresh tracks, and examining them closely discovered they had been made by a party of one man, two gins, and two pickaninnies. The man's track un- doubtedly belonged to Bendeena, for one of the toes on the left foot was missing, and Moomera could swear to the footmark. The party was head- ing for the hollow tree that had been burnt, so the Chief pursued his way to the camp, knowing his friend would be with him next day at the latest. Bendeena with others had seen the smoke, and as most of the tribe had been in recently except Moomera it 

 was concluded he had signalled. Be- sides, there was no other member of the tribe would have dared to make such an open signal. "I'm sure it's Moomera," said Ben- deena, "and he wants assistance. I am his eldest blood brother, and will go. My wives are with my mother at the big lagoon, I will get them and ascertain who made the smoke. If you don't see two smokes rising within three days you will know there are enemies about and I have been killed." Bendeena found the remains of the burnt tree and also Moomera's signs, so that about the middle of the fol- lowing day the friends met and ex- changed greetings. Two signal smokes were sent up in the usual manner, in accordance with Bendeena's pro- mise, and Moomera disclosed his ob- ject in seeking his friend. Bendeena was not at all favourably, impressed with the scheme. The Wy- reema had brought them nothing but disaster, and he declined to have any- thing more to do with her, especially as all the cargo was gone. But the Chief was not disheartened, and suggested they should meet the white lads and hear what they had to say. Bendeena was not even willing to go this far, but his scruples were eventually overcome, and the two fam- ilies arrived at Jack's camp the next afternoon. The lads had been working steadily, at the canoe, and had excavated the interior roughly. First of all they dressed the upper side until a level surface was obtained with the adzes, when they chipped the inside, out with the axes. The expedition with which they had worked and the usefulness of the tools had a great effect upon Ben- deena, who, after greetings had been exchanged, stood looking on while they worked, and it no doubt added considerably in inducing him to re- consider his decision. At any rate, before they had retired for the night he had promised to help them bring the ship out of the creek, on the same conditions as Moomera. The blacks proved splendid work- men, soon learning to handle the chisels, and by the end of another week the tree had been conveyed to the beach on rollers and hollowed out to an average thickness of half an inch, while it was nearly thirty feet in length. A block had been left about ten feet from the bows for stepping a mast, otherwise the craft would have been split by the wind acting as a lever on the mast, and kangaroo skins were sewn together for a sail shaped, like a lug. Paddles were made from pine planks, one of which was to serve in steering. As it would be unwise to hunt in the neighbourhood of the Wyreema, several kangaroos and emus were kill- ed and the flesh smoked for use on the voyage, for the dogs had to be fed as well as the human beings. Both of the lads had an intense dis- like to the blacks' dogs, and as their owners absolutely refused to leave them behind Jack stipulated they should be kept before the mast. At length everything was ready, and taking advantage of the calm which almost invariably exists at early morn- ing, the canoe was slid on rollers into the sea. The dogs and rugs, the latter being smellier even than the blacks, were stowed forward, the blacks sat on a thwart in the centre, and the white lads in the stern. Un- til the wind rose all hands had to use the paddles, for the wood was green and heavy, but about 9 o'clock the usual north-easter got up, and then Jack steered while Will held the sheet. They had not sailed half a mile when it became evident the canoe was very crank, and that if the breeze increased materially she cer- tainly would swamp, and as the wind would certainly become stronger as the day grew older, Jack steered her gingerly for the nearest point of the long island. Happily they reached the island without mishap, the blacks being quite ignorant of being in any danger from a capsize. The sail was lowered, and the gins held the boat in shallow water while the impedimenta were carried ashore, when she was beached and hauled up beyond high water mark. Jack's plan was explained in a few words, and taking two axes he and the Chief set out in search of some straight pine saplings. They had not far to go, and a cooey summoned the others to where they had felled three, one being thirty feet long, and the others about fifteen. As the blacks, considered they had done enough for one day, three bough gunyahs were erected by the gins while the men hunted. (To be continued.)
