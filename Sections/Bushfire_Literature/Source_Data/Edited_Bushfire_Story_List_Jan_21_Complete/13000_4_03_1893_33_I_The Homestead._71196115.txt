 Frank Halyard's Disappearance. 

 (BY "A. M. M.") 

 CHAPTER I. 

 The Homestead. 

 � Well I declare that new manager is a 

 splendid fellow ; quite a treat to have him about the place." 

 " I am indeed glad of that, and perhaps now, my dear, you will find time to take a little much-needed and well-earned rest, since you have evidently secured a man whom you can trust," 

 ��Trust? Yes, indeed, I am confident I could trust Halyard with uncounted 

 gold ; he's the very soul of honor and has a head on his shoulders worth any two or dinary men's." 

 " That is a very, high opinion you have of him, I hope he will always give you reaeon to retain it." 

 The speakers in this conversation were Mr. Geo.?ge'Wilmont andjhis wife. �He was a well-to-do squatter, and a man of upright principles and integrity, respected by everyone who knew him, and loved sin cerely by his wife and family, which con sisted of a son and two daughters, all grown up. 

 ^George Wilmont had been one of the early Queensland settlers, and had met with many difficulties and losses in hie first endeavors to succeed as a selector. He had emigrated when quite a young man fall of health, strength and vigor, and fit for almost anything. The colonies were ' young and work scarce. So he thought 

 that if he were to invest his small capital in land and live stock he might manage to start a station on a small scale, and so work himself up the hill-if slowly, yet surely. But he was over sanguine, and did not count upon the many ups and downs he must experience before he should even be enabled to get back what he had laid out in bard oash, let alone put by for a rainy day^ or launch; out on a larger 

 scale. 

 His selection was situated^in the Bur nett district, and consisted'of about 150 aores of well watered, pasture land, excel lently adapted for grazing purposes. The town of Tiaro, which lay about 16 miles south of Maryborough and 180 north of Brisbane, was the nearest and most easy of access. It hiing an agricultural township, aud beautifully situated, made the pastoral districts of greater value. But George Wilraont found that a large amount of physical endurance and perseverance was required to start a station even on a small -�cale. Dry reasons came, and the sheep and cattle died of thirst ; then disease would seize his flocks, when they appeared to be most healthy, and worst of all were the dangers he was often exposed to from the fierce ravages of the bush fire, which destroyed all before it, leaving nothing but � charred and blackened waste, where once grew and flourished green grass and fields of waving corn. Twice had his station huts, barns, and stockyards also fallen vic tims to the ruthless destroyer, fire ; and often almost in despair George Wilmont had nearly resolved to throw up the whole thing and return fo England thoroughly discouraged and disheartened at his want of success. But his indomitable will persevered, and his strength of purpose trinmphed over his difficulties, though they were many and severe. And at last his efforts were crowned with success. And 

 when the sun of prosperity deigned to shine upon him and enabled him to weather tbe storm, when he felt himself prepared to meet any fresh trial or trouble which miirht assail him, he thought it was time to take to himself a wife/for his life on the station was very lonely, and female society a thing almost denied him. 

 At length he managed to take a run to Brisbane, and while there met a young lady who won his heart, and who, he felt, waB the one, and the only one, with whom he could share his life. 

 He eventually obtained the promise of her hand from her father, after whioh he re turned to the station and made arrange 

 ments about the erection of a suitable 

 homestead, fit for the reception of hie hride. He added another 300 acres to his selection, and on the prettiest and most convenient Spot built a large and com modious house, which, though rough in exterior, was snug and comfortable inside. This he had fully furnished, BO that his hride should miss none of the comforts and conveniences to which she had been 

 accustomed, for he waa fully aware that only true love would have induced her to leave home, parents, and friends to share his uncertain fortunes in an o�t-of-the way place like the small and insignificant township of Tiaro. 

 "When the homestead was finished it presented a somewhat bare appearance. The pasture land around the house stretched to the very foot of Mount Bopple, and was therefore protected from the fierce westerly winds. Eventually everything was ready, and with a light heart George "VVilmont proceeded to town to claim his bride. The marriage ceremony was performed in her father's house, and amid earnest wishes for their future happiness from all, the pair departed for their new home. 

 It was with mingled feelings of pride and joy that George Wilmont installed his sweet young wife in tho home he had pre pared for her, and he felt that now he could surmount any obstaoles while he had the consolation of her love. He had; so long experienced the loneliness and dis comforts of single life on a station that he could thoroughly appreciate her refined society. 

 So time went on, and things prospered with the Wilmonts ; and with prosperity also came the heirs to it in the persona of one son and two daughters, which were the joy and pride of their parents' hearts. Under Mr. Wilmont's personal supervision everything was well conducted ; he managed all his own affairs until his children were grown up, and his boy-the second eldest-bad received a thorough education, and had returned home fully prepared (as the father thought) to take his place in the management of the 

 station. 

 Maurice Wilmont was a fine young fel low of 20 years of age at the time our story, opens, dark complexioned, and rather sun burned, with an open countenance and pleasant smile whioh won the hearts of all who knew him. He resembled his mother very much, his features being sharp and clear cut, and he gave promise of being a handsome man. His youngest sister Fanny more nearly re sembled him, but with a fairer complexion and bair of a lighter hue. Yet it was quite evident to the veriest stranger that the two were sister and brother, though their dispositions were distinctly opposite, for while Maurice was quiet and easy going Fanny was of a hasty temperament. Yet they were fast friends and inseparable com panions. She had seen 18 summers, and was as rosy and fresh as a picture, and the pet of the household. 

 But what of Beatrice-grave, sensible, thoughtful Beatrice-the hope and stay of father and mother ; the one who could do anything and everything, from churning and baking to playing, singing, or sketch ing. Everyone depended upon Beatrice, her gentle face and quiet manner won respect and admiration from all who came in contact with |her. She was fair as a lily, with soft blue eyes, and a sweet, winning expression of countenance. Her wealth of light golden hair clustered in waving coils round her small and shapely head, and her face, when she smiled, seemed as though suddenly illuminated with a hidden light. Certainly Beatrioe Wilmont was a sweet and lovely girl, yet so unconscious of her beauty and grace, a fact that lent an extra charm to it. She 

 had just turned 22, and was grave beyond her years. She resembled ' her father in complexion and disposition. Her fingers were never idle, and her services and ad vice were constantly in demand-she was her mother's right hand in everything. 

 Up to the time Maurice returned from school Mr. Wilmont had been obliged to have a sort of under-manager on the sta tion, but he was BO neglectful as to be more trouble than his ser vices were worth, and the squatter found that, as he had more than half the superintending to do himself, he might as well dispense with his services and do it all until Maurice would be ready to help him, 

 But when Maurice did come home his 

 father discovered that the boy was so full of life and spirits that it would be some time before he would be sufficiently sensible and steady to take the entire management of the station on his own 

 shoulders. Therefore he determined to 

 make a trip to Brisbane and try to obtain a man who he thought might suit him one whom he could truBt with full charge and entire confidence, and also one who would be competent to instruct Maurice in many little things relating to agriculture. After about a fortnight's stay in Brisbane, 

 Mr. Wilmont happened to meet with a. 

 young man who took his fancy, and who he believed would exactly suit him. 

 Frank Halyard was a man of about 2G years of age, of a very dark complexion and jet black hair, which curled naturally over a high and intellectual forehead. He was above the average height, well built, and though not stout his frame was so well knit together that he appeared to be slighter than he really was. He was 

 rather handsome-in fact so much so 

 that Mr. Wilmont thought twioe "before he decided to engage him in case he should infatuate that irresistible Fanny ; aa for his Beatrice she -was proof against any thing like that he assured himself. She was too sedate to fall in love with a hand-! some face. � 

 Halyard appeared to be a man who had peen better days ; his aristocratic features and gentlemanly bearing bespoke noble lineage, and his polished manners, which shone from beneath the now roughened surface, told of a time whon he was the idolised son of a doting mother. Grace and culture still lurked beneath the soft inflexions of his clear voice, and the small, shapely hand, though now muoh browned by a tropical sun, told of their ignorance of toil, and the tanned face pre sented a striking contrast to the whiteness of neck and arms, which the sun bad not browned. Whether he was the black Bheep of his family, or the scion of a noble race, they did not know. At all events, Mr. Wilmont engaged him, and when our story opens he had been installed as manager at Korralla Station for the period of one month. But though the time was short, it was quite long enough for Mr. Wilmont to discover that his new manager was a trea-! sure not often met with ; and his opening speeoh reveals the hitch opinion he enter tained of his merits, for he finds that every thing goes as merrily as a marriage bell, without the least trouble or interference 

 on his part, and also what pleases him even better, that his eon is progressing wonderfully under Halyard's tuition, the influence of the older and graver man tend ing to subdue the wild, ungovernable nature of the youngjuan. 

 Mr, Wilmont feared that Maurice would 

 object to being instructed by one under him. But to his intense gratification he finds that he actually asks Halyard for in formation, ' and is always grate ful for it ; in fact, has taken a thorough liking to him, as they have all done, girls included. For while Maurice finds in him a companion, Beatrice and Fanny feel that the evenings spent in the large and comfortable drawing-room would he very slow and monotonous if they were deprived of his company. For he can play and sing, talk well, and take a rubber at whist better than anyone of them. He can teach Fanny to paint from natural flowers j and on Sunday afternoons 

 he will walk for miles in search of rare 

 speoimens, with all of which he takes real pleasure in explaining their different and peculiar qualities, and does it with apparently so much true knowledge of the subject that they cannot help feel ing interested in his explanation, and also gain information thereby. ' He is kind, thoughtful, and considerate to all, and in every way confirms their firmly-expressed opinion that " Frank Halyard is a thorough, gentleman."
