 CHAPTER XIII. . Shocking News fob Kate, 

 ' Imagine my feelings if you can, Emma, under this dreadful indignity ! How can I soften my mind down to French exercises, rule of three, or any other pen ance ! The presumption ef that saucy, little] marine monster is beyond anything that ever was heard of.' Thus exclaimed Jenny, as she entered the school room with her Bister, on the morning after the occur rences in the preceding chapter. The mailman' had shortly before left the bag, with letters and papers by the English mail. There was one for Jenny, written 

 uu ciuuuDoca �*��jcjl, n&bu �u oui^uut uu w^ ui hue xiuub page, cleverly drawn in Indian ink. Jenny was feigning to be very indignant at the temerity of Master Rogers in writing a letter to her ; but, despite her wrathful-looking antics, there was an expression all over her pretty face which plainly indicated that Bhe was pleased with the missive from the sprightly young sailor ; and Emma perfectly well understood that Jenny was only in fun. It was indeed a modestly worded epistle j a sort of brief history of his ad ventures since the pleasant voyage when Jenny was a passenger in his ship ; and it wound up by informing her that he had been promoted to the post of third mate on board a large snip in the Madras trade. ' What do I care for his promotion ? ' continued Jenny, with a look of mock scorn. ' How dare he presume to tell me that he has got a stuffed dolphin, and a collection of cowrie shells for me ! I should like to make him eat them all. Ugh ! how his letter smells of pitch !' ' ?? O Jenny ! for shame ! ? How very rude of you to throw the poor fellow's letter into the coal-scuttle. You ought to show it to mamma before you burn it.' ; ' Of course I know that : I am not going to burn \\ it. Hand me the tongs, and I will carry it to mamma. I hope she will persuade papa to write to Mr. third- ; mate Rogers, and to draw a big stock-whip for a i frontispiece, just to frighten him. I'd anchor him if I ? had him here. Write to me indeed ! Pshaw ! what ; next ? Where is mamma, Emma ? ' ' She is in the breakfast parlour. But stay, Jenny ; don't go to her just now. I am afraid some bad news has come in the post-bag. I saw one letter with a black border all round it.' 0 gear ! why did you not tell me that before, ' Emma ? ' said Jenny, whose face suddenly grew very serious. .' Here have I been going on with my non sense, and perhapB dear mamma is in trouble. How is it that Miss May6on has not come in to begin school?' ' I don't know, dear ; but I am afraid the black ;. letter has brought some bad news for her. Let us get on with our lessons.' , The letter had indeed conveyed sad news for Kate. ' It was from a clergyman in London, and was ad- ' dressed to Mrs. Wilton. It stated, in feeling language, , that a terrible disaster had befallen the Mayson family, who were his parishioners. It appeared that ' the whole family had gene for a holiday excursion on board one of the small steamboats, on the Thames. The boat's boiler exploded at one of the wharfs on the river, and, sad to say, Mrs. Mayson and her : youngest daughter were killed on the spot ; Mr. May son was seriously injured, and the other children were scalded, but not dangerously. Many passengers besides were killed or wounded, and the boat was shattered into fragments. . That terrific disaster� the blowing-up of the Cricket steamer � is doubtless still in the memory of some persons who suffered, either personal injurySbr bereavement on that sad occasion. After giving lengthy particulars of the present condi tion of Mr. Mayson and his surviving children, the clergyman requested Mrs. Wilton to break the dis tressing news to Miss Mayson, and also to offer her his heart-felt sympathy and condolence. 1 Bhould have before stated that Kate had written to her family by every mail since she came to the crlony, and the arrival of a ship from London (which always brought a mail in those days) was one of the greatest joys of her life, for she invariably received letters from her father and mother ; and about twice a year she got a welcome budget of newB from each of her brothers and sisters. Many a merry laugh she 

 had enjoyed with her pupils, when reading to them the funny letters from her comical brother Harry, the didactic epistles of Fred, or the less pretentious notes from sisters Amy and wee Alice. : Mrs. Wilton felt quite unequal to the distressing duty of disclosing to Kate the purport of the letter, and she sat for nearly an hour in sorrowful conference with her husband, without being able to decide upon any definite way of opening the painful subject. At length they resolved to call Kate into the parlour, and then trust to their hearts' impulse what to say. Kate was in her bedroom when a servant rapped at the door to tell her that Mrs. Wilton wished to speak with her. She forthwith hastened to the parlour, and her swol len eyes showed that she had been weeping. ' You have some sorrowful news for me, I am sure, ma'am?' said Kate, and she burst into tears when she saw Mrs Wilton' b face. ** I apprehended it the moment I heard that there were no letters in the mail-bag for me. Pray tell me all, my dear Mrs. Wilton. I shall have strength to bear whatever is coming. I am calmer now, you see.' ' Some of your dear relatives are ill, Kate,' replied Mr. Wilton, in a compassionate tone. ' Are they all living, sir ? ' she asked, with sup pressed feeling. '1 am sorry to say they are not all living, Kate� that is to Bay� they are not living on�arth, my dear ; but you know they were prepared for sudden death. There ib a blessed solace in that assurance.' ' Who are dead, sir r Pray tell me at once. I can bear to hear all, better than I can bear this painful suspense.' ' Your youngest sister is in heaven,' Mr. Wilton's voice quavered out that sentence, and for a minute he hesitated, while Kate continued to direct a calm in quiring gaze at him, as if Bhe was prepared to hear more. ' Your dear mother is in heaven, also, Kate.' Mr. Wilton saw her face change, and he sprang for ward and caught her in his arms as she was falling to the floor in a swoon. The girls in the schoolroom hearing an unusual stir, in the parlour ran in, and when they learned the cause of Kate's distress their sympathy with her was warmer than words can ex press. Jenny flung her arms around the neck of the fainting girl as she lay on a couah, and her whole soul seemed to gush out in words of melting tenderness ; while Emma, with equal affection though less demon stration, applied such restoratives as were at hand. Presently Kate recovered her consciousness, and tears came to the relief of her overladen heart. Her kind friends sat and wept with her, and for a while not a word was spoken. At length she said, in sobbing ac cents, *' Would you mind letting me see the letter that you have received, Mrs. Wilton ? ' ? ? Yes, my dear ; you shall see it. I think you had better go to your room new, and I will bring the letter to you oy-and-bye. Emma, dear, you go with Miss Mayson, and stay with her till I come. No, no, Jenny ! you had better stop with me.' Mrs. Wilton then kissed the poor afflicted girl, and she went away to her bedroom, leaning on the helping arm of Emma. Mr. Wilton had gone out of the room and taken the clergyman's letter in his pocket, for the purpose of showing it to Mr. Thompson, and also to prevent Kate from seeing it until she was more composed in mind. Ab Walter read this letter Mr. Wilton could see by his pale face and quivering lips that its con tents affected him more than he dared to express. His manly heart deeply 'sympathised with Kate's distress, and at the same time the fascinating pictures of conjugal happiness, which he had fondly hoped he was soon to realise, faded from his mind's eye,, and his life's prospective ; was as sombre as a glance over a flooded country on a stormy evening. He returned the letter to Mr. Wilton, and after a few feeling remarks expressive of Mb condolence with Kate in her bereavement, he mounted his horsey which was standing at a slip-rail, and rode away to give some directions to the men who were at work at the water hole. We will leave him to his solitary ride through the bush and to his reflections. About an . hour after Kate had gone to her room Mrs. Wilton went to her. She was comparatively calm, and at her repeated entreaty Mrs. Wilton showed her the letter which contained such mournful news, whereupon Kate's composure forsook her again, and tor some time she continued to wring her hands in an agony of grief, and to exclaim, ' My poor dear father! My dear suffering father! What would. I not give if I were near to him, or only knew of his present state.' O, why did I leave, my beloved parents ! ' Mrs. Wilton knew that wdrds just then would not avail to stop the torrent of feeling, so she sat in silence until Kate gradually grew calmer. At length she asked, ' What dp you think I had better do, Mrs. Wilton?' 'Well, my love, I must consider very carefully before I express a decided opinion. I wul not ven ture to do it to-day. What does your own heart suggest at the present moment ? ' ' ' That it is my duty to go to England as soon as possible, ma'am. I could not possibly stay here and know that my beloved father is lying iu � perhaps on his dying bed � and with no one belonging to him able to nurse him, for what could dear little Amy do. even if she is not confined to her bed ? And the poor boys may need nursing also. 0,1 must go ! I must go at once! Nothing .must stop me!' ?'? Now, �y dear girl, don't say any more about it at present. ' Call upon me in the time of trouble.' You know that those are words of an Almighty Helper. . I am sure you will obey the injunction, and you will certainly have deliverance, according to the promise, and be directed in the right way. I will go and consult Mr. Wilton, and you may rest assured that we will do all we can to help you. Emma, dear, vou stay here for a little while ; perhaps by-aud-by Kate would like to be alone, and if so you can then go down stairs and take charge of the house until I return.' Mrs. Wilton then went out and ordered the gig to be got ready. Soon afterwards she started with her husband for the store at LashweU to select necessary mourning for Kate and to hire a needle woman to go to Yarramundoe to work. Emma and Jenny stopped with Kate, and if kind words and loving caresBes could heal a wounded spirit her grief would soon have been dispelled. Happy would it be if every poor sorrowing mortal could find such ; genuine hearts to condole with them in their bereave- : meets. ; CHAPTER XIV. Pbbpabationb fob a Vovage Home. Throughout the ensuing week the schoolroom was occupied by a needlewoman who was making up mourning, which operation Mrs. Wilton superin tended, and did not consult Kate in any matter except when it was really necessary. All school duties were suspended, and by way of diverting her mind as much as possible from distressing thoughts Emma and Jenny devoted nearly all their time to Kate. They took frequent rides about the bush with her ; and as she revisited the rural spots where she had enjoyed so many pleasant hours with her youthful companions, and as she gazed 'at. the varied landscape beauties which she was so soon to leave, and which she dared not encourage a hope that she would ever again behold, she felt a regret which seemed for . the time to overcast all her deeper borowb. She could plainly perceive that her considerate pupils were trying their utmost by softened gaiety to make her forget her troubles, and she strove to l�t them feel that their little kind devices were successful. She loved to watch the happy sparkle in theii eyes as she 

 tmJed. But when she was alone her sorrow would? ov�rflow, and in its keenest paroxysms she thought that her seasons of joy were for ever fled. How hard it is for even the most buoyant of mortals to look hopefully beyond the mists of present trouble ! And it sometimes baffles the faith of experienced Chris tians to realise the supporting grace of infinite love when heart-pressed with heaviness through personal or family affliction. Mr. and Mrs. Wilton held frequent consultations about Kate's future course. They felt their responsi bility as her deputed guardians, and there was not a particle of selfishness manifested in any of their cal culations. Ihey well knew that it would inconve nience them to part with Kate, for a governess pos sessing her peculiar adaptabilities was not so easy to find then as it would be at the present time ; but per sonal considerations were all set aside. They promptly decided, on the first receipt of the sad news, that it was Kate's duty to go home and attend to her sick. relatives ; and now came the practical consideration ? when was she to go, and by what vessel. Mr Wilton ascertained through the Herald newspaper that two ships were then on the berth for London and he resolved to go to Sydney at once and mike - arrangements for a passage tor Kate in one of them. ' Mr, Wilton will start for Sydney to-morrow, my dear/ ' said Mrs. Wilton te Kate, on the ensuing Friday evening, ' He js going to try to secure a passage for you in the Alfred. It is a very fine ship, and Captain Brett is a friend of ours ; we could place you under his charge with perfect confidence.' *' I fear I shall never be able to repay you and Mr. Wilton for all your great kindness,' began Kate. 11 There now � don't say any more about that, dear. It is our duty to help you all we can, and we do it; willingly, for we love you almost as much as if you were our own daughter. Now, love, just cast your eye along this list. I have written down everything I can think of that you are likely to want on the voyage. You must haveplenty of warm clothing and bedding, you know, for it is a dismally cold passage round Cape Horn. If there is anything else you think of let me add it to the list, and Mr. Wilton will) get everything in Sydney and bring them up with, him.' ' I think I had better not buy any expensive things, ma'am,' said Kate, with a sigh. ' I fear my poor dear father will not be very well eff, and I should'. like to carry home with me what little money I can. When my passage is paid for I shall not have much.: to spare for my outfit. I have �62 in Mr. Wilton's, hands, I think, ma'am.' ?' It is rather more than that, dear. Mr. Wilton-, put your money into the Savings Bank as it became due, so you will have the interest to add to it. I don't know how much it is exactly, but I shall go to Sydney with you to see you safely on board ship, and you may depend on getting a satisfactory account of your money before you start. It is kind and thought ful of you to save all the money you can to carry home to your poor friends ; but you must have a suit able outfit for the voyage, or the cold weather will. kill you. Don't trouble yourself any more on thatr. score, Kate. It will be all right, you'll see.' After a few days absence Mr. Wilton returned to- Yarramundoe. He had fortunately arranged that Kate should share a stern cabin of the Alfred with a lady and her daughter. The ship was to sail ten days, hence, so there was no time to lose in making ud the material for , Kate's outfit, and which Mr. Wilton brought back with him in a bulky bale. It was evident to Mr. and Mrs. Wilton that Walter Thompson was deeply concerned at the prospect of Kate's early departure. They did not let him. know that they knew the. cause of his unusual depression, but they silently sympathised with him. They missed' Mb cheerful conversation and genial humour, which-, had always made the gatherings at the social board), seasons of intellectual enjoyment ; and though his in nate gentlemanly bearing was never out of Bight, his quiet reserve and his pensive looks � though some times relieved by a forced smile � plainly betokened, the war of feeling which was going ou in his heart. Each evening, immediately after tea, he would retire to his bedroom, and till a late hour of the night, andt sometimes all night long, a light could be seen through his window. He was busily employed iu sewing to gether a quantity of opossum skins, and platypus ekins, which he had been for several years collecting, and had preserved with his own hands. ? After several nights' work his task was at length completed, and there lay before him on the table a large opossum skin rug, with a lining of thick scarlet baize ; also a. muff, and a sort of tippet or cape, made out of pre- j served platypus skins, which were also warmly lined j with woollen material, and an extra lining of green j silk. In the finishing off of the latter articles, he had had confidential aid from the needlewoman in the house. j He stood for a time gazing at his handiwork, and1 j though any young man might have been proud of j such work, for it evidenced ingenuity and patience, as j well as artistic skill, Walter's face did not indicate 1 satisfaction ; on the contrary it looked very sad. The j rug, and the muff, and cape were for Kate� to be a. 1 parting present from him to the idol of his heart's J first love. For yeara he had secretly cherished a con- I fident hope that she would be the sharer of his future 1 life's joys and sorrows� his darling wife; buthiscup^ 1 of happinesB waB suddenly shattered at his feet, and I his prospect seemed to be walled up to the skies by a I cloud of impenetrable darkness. In the consciousness- I that there was no human eye to observe his weakness,. 1 he there gave free vent to his overwhelming emotion ; I and theugh he was as brave a young man as ever rode 1 through a new country, or camped by a bush fire, he I wept uke a child. 1 The morning was breaking, and the golden streaks- 1 of sunlight were obscuring Walter's dimly burning. | lamp, but he was pacing his room. Throughout that ? long night of heaviness, many plans and devices had ? passed over his active mind. At one moment he re- ? solved to marry Kate, and accompany her home a* ? her natural protector ; but sober reflection discarded ? the idea as impracticable; for what could he do ? in England for a livelihood, with so httle ? capital, and with less -adaptability for home t We r- ? Then he tried to cherish a hope that Kate would soon ? return again to the colony, but that idea yielded mat a very brief comfort, for she might, alas ! find her father | an helpless invalid� perhaps crippled for life, and in ? such a case how could he reasonably expect her to ? return to marry him ? He dared not make sucn a ? selfish proposal to her. Many other plans were sue- ? gested to his mind, to be as quickly discarded, and m ? length, in the bitterness of his helplessness, he agam ? supplicated for help and solace from *� AJnngiitJ ? Being, who had guided and protected his beloved. ? parents, through many leng years of perils and tn�� ? in their missionary life,� and whom he from to� ? infancy had been taught to love and 6�ve;f i'; ? troubled heart ever sought in vain for comfort i tro �. � that Omnipotent source ; and soon the murky cloua, g which had seemed to darken his way for time and tor | eternity, lifted, and a happy resignation fiUed w m eThroughout that day-the last day �f Kate's stay at | Tarramundoe-Walter's was the most hopeful face i m the household, and the ladies were gUd of the wiiung h help he gave them in cording and k�^n.S *Tia 1 luggage. Most persons have had some efpenence i* m paEg up operations, and there would .be ^othmg ? Tery novel in it if I were to miotttely describe we a 

 Tmey bustle at Yarranrandoe. Everybody was active ; and as work of any sort is one of the beat panaceas that has ever been discovered for leading the mind ?tram distressing thoughts, there was not so much .manifestation of sadness as might have been expected, under quietercircumstarces. An hour's work after 10 completed the packing up process, and all was in readiness for the start at daylight next morning. Kate took .&l&Bt-glance-round her bedroom, to see if she had left anything out of her trunks ; and she dried the tears which started to her eyes as she closed her empty wardrobe, and then she put on the most cheer - 'ful -looks ijhe -could command and descended to the ipariour. _�_��?� __ mmmm
