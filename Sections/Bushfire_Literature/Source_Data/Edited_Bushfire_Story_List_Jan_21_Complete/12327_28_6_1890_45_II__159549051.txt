 MY WEDDING DAY. 

 A SOUTH AUSTRALIAN STORY. 

 [From Chambers's Journal.] 

 In Two Chapters. �Chatter IL 

 . "What time is it?" asked Mrs. Green, when the two women had started up the hill once more. "Twoo'clock? You don t say 60! Well, we may as well have a bit of something our selves. The fire will be on the top of that hill in half an hour, at the rate it is coming. If they can't stop it, it will come down here, and we'll have to turn to and fight with the rest of them." 

 "We'll have to look out anyways," said Biddy. " The sparks will be all over the place, with this wind, and it's not much time well have then to be thinking of dinner." 

 The children were called in; and we sat down to a picnic sort of meal, consisting of cold beef, plum-pudding, and a tart or two from the unfortunate wedding breakfast. These tarts reminded me of a fact that I found hard to realize�that I was really married, and that this was my wedding day: yes, actually my wedding day! and here was I, the bride, sitting down to a demoralised sort of Christmas dinner in a hot kitchen, with a half-roasted clergy man in his shirt sleeves, and Mrs. Green in a voluminous cooking apron. And Jack. Where was he ? Over a mile away, fighting the fire in heat and dust and smoke. In danger, perhaps 1 Oh Jack, dear Jack! And I lost myself in loving anxious thought, till I was roused by Biddy's voice�" My word!" she said, coming to the back door�"it's near now, roaring like anything, and they're beating like mad." 

 We jumped up at once and went outside. There was a fierce deep roaring rushing sound like a big bush-fire, and nothing else. The smoke hung over us thicker than ever, and like a lurid cloud kept off the sunlight, the sun itself showing through it as a dull deep crimson disc; and through the roaring and crackling of the flames we heard the sound of the branches as the men fought with all their might. 

 While we watched, Mrs. Brown and Mis. Jones came hurrying down again, bringing with them some of the eatables they had just taken up. 

 "They've no time to eat," said Mrs. Brown; " but they're just dried up with thirst. They want some more tea as soon as yon can send it up." 

 "I will take it," I said. 

 " Fray, allow me," said Mr. Smith. 

 "Well," said Mrs. Green, "I expect Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Jones are tired; besides, they want their dinner." 

 I went in search of my shadiest hat, and the parson donned his coat�a great mistake, as it 

 proved�and we started off, ne with two buckets , of tea, and I with one. Now, full buckets are awkward things to carry up a hill-side at the best of times, and when they are full of tea, every drop of which you know will be precious to the thirsty men above, you get nervous, and consequently spill more. Mr. Smith started with a light heart to carry those buckets up that hill, and if his heart was heavier when he reached the top, the buckets were considerably 

 lighter. We got on well enough at first, but : soon came to a steep place, where, though our arms were aching furiously, there was no place flat enough to set the buckets down on. Then we had to sidle along the hill, and Mr. Smith bad to hold one bucket higher than the other to keep it off the ground ; and in spite of all his care, that up-hill bucket would keep catch ing on sticke and stones, and sending cataracts of steaming tea over his legs. He did not complain ; but it must have been too hot to be comfortable. At last we got on to a cattle track, which made walking easier, though it bad its drawbacks too, being six inches deep in soft, well-trodden dust. The condition of the parson's moist legs after two minutes' walk through this may be imagined. He sailed benignly on, however, witn one long coat-tail in each bucket of tea, till I could stand it no 

 "Air. ismitn, 1 said, "1 am afraid the tea will spoil your coat." 

 "Dear me! dear me!" he said, "whatshall I dot They will go in, and I can't put the buokets down, and the tea will be spoilt. Dear me! what shall I do 5" 

 " Shall I pin them up for you f' I asked. 

 "Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Rushton, if you would, he answered gratefully. 

 I managed to set my bucket down and steady it with my foot while I pinned the tails of his coat together behind, so that it looked like a 

 demented swallow-tail. 

 " Thank you, thank you, very much indeed.' was all he said just then; but when we came to a place where we could set down our loads and rest, he observed, as he mournfully gazed at his muddy legs, "Really, Mrs. Rushton, I am afraid this kind of work is detrimental to my cloth." 

 At last we reached the top, and found the men hard at work. The fire had come upon them before they expected. Where a track was already burnt, they stopped it easily enough; but just here they were having a hard fight. So much we learned from one and another as they stopped to swallow a pannikin of tea and then rush hack to their work again. 

 How hot they looked; hot and tired, with ; faces scorched and grimy, and eyes red with the stinging smoke. I had seen thirst before, though not quite so bad as this. Mr. Smith had not, I think, and his face grew very grave 

 as he watched them. 

 "Well, parson," stud one, as he drank the tea, in a voice husky and weak with exhaus tion, "you're a Christian for this, if you never said a prayer." 

 The little clergyman looked distressed; he was a little shocked at first, I think; .then I heard him murmur to himself�"A cup of cold water ! I never knew what that meant till to-day." 

 When we got down again he insisted on making another trip at once. I could not help admiring him as he started up the hill again with a bucket in each hand, tniB time without his coat. 

 "Well," said Biddy, looking after him, "he's got some pluck in spite of his ooat." 

 "He's a brick 1" said the children, and I quite agreed with them. 

 The fire was stopped on the hill behind the house, and the men had gone along the ridge to stop it further on. We had dismantled the neglected breakfast table, and rearranged it with more regard for compactness than ele gance, ready for the men's supper; and at last the long hot day was nearly over. Having nothing particular to do, I went and eat under the back verandah to rest. Mrs. Jones did 

 likewise, and leaning her elbows on her knees and her chin on her hands, gazed silently up wards at the smoke that told of the fight still going on. Mrs. Brown seized a broom and proceeded to sweep up the leaves scattered about by our discarded decorations, talking meanwhile about other bush fires she had seen. How that the fight was no longer in sight, the 

 sense of excitement and conflict we had felt all 

 day in some degree abated. Peaceful home sounds�the crying of a calf, the musical sound of milking from the bail-yard close by, and the cheerful tinkling of teaspoons in the kitchen contrasted strangely with the lurid glare of the smoky sunlight and the distant roaring of the flames. Ih a gum-tree close by were a crowd of magpies that bad flown screaming 

 away from the fire, and were watching it in tently, now and then bursting into a flood of angry song: while once or twice a flock of paroquets whizzed shrieking overhead. 

 I paid little attention to Mrs. Brown's con versation, but fell to thinking�of Jack, of course�till Biddy came across to the daily with her buckets of milk, and Mrs. Green came out and called the children in to tea. They came scampering in, discussing'the day's events with a vivacity which put day-dreainmg out of the question for the time being. 

 During tea, the talk was still bush-fires ; no one ever talks of anything else while one is burning. Afterwards, when Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Jones had departed to their respective homes�cottages a little distance off�and Mrs. Green and Biddy were busy preparing for the men, whom they expected soon, I sat on the 

 verandah and tned to talk the children into a calm enough state of mind for bedtime. It had been a wildly-exciting day for them, and a " continual feast as well; for they had made raids on the kitchen every now and then, carry ing off their booty to bo devoured in some place where there was a good view of the fire. They implored me not to speak of bed at first; but in spite of themselves they grew drowsy as they calmed down, and were soon ready to say "Good night." 

 When they had gone I lost myself im my own thoughts again. How long I sat there dreaming I do not know. The sun had set; the short twilight was over, and the smoulder ing logs shone out like large red stars from the blackened hillside above, when I noticed a strange light to my left. Going to the end of the house, I saw a line of fire coming towards us along the flat. A smouldering' log must have rolled down from above arid lighted the grass. "Fire! fire! just here !" I shouted. 

 Mrs. Green and Biddy rushed out, and took in the situation at a glance. Biddy just threw back her head, put her bands to her mouth and " coo-ed" loud and long. 

 " Get a can and wet the grass at the end of the house, Mary !" Mrs. Green called to me as she ran round the house shuting the windows, to keep the sparks out. 

 " Biddyj" she continued, " throw water on the roof; it's as dry as tinder." 

 Biddy gave one more long "coo-o-ee!" and seizing a bucket, fell to work; while Mrs. Green disappeared into the house, returning with the children, blinking and bewildered. Helling them in blankets, she deposited them in the bed of a dried-up creek near the house. Meanwhile, I had been running backwards and forwards with two large watering-cans from the tubs we had filled in the morning, trying to soak a strip of grass to check the fire in its advances on the house. My task was only half finished, however, when the fire come up. I caught up a branch and called to the others for help. We beat and beat with all our might; but the wind was high and the grass long, and it seemed as if we could not keep it back. The heat was intense, and the smoke choked and blinded us; but we kept on, till I felt as if each blow would be the last, and dimly wondered what would happen when I gave in, 

 as I must do soon. 

 I do not know how long we worked; it seemed hours ; but I suppose it was not many minutes. _ All at once we heard men's voices and running feet, and a dozen strong arms were beating beside us. It was a sharp tussle; but they got it under, and were just congratulating themselves on arriving in the nick of time, when a voice�Jack's voice�was heard calling for help, and they saw that the fire, though turned away from the house, was making straight for the woolshed, which stood on a slight rise a little beyond. Jack was fighting it single-handed. It seemed to be getting the better of him; then, while I watched, I saw him fall, and the fire rushed onwards. And then 1 suppose I fainted, for 1 remember nothing more till I felt myself slowly and painfully coming back to life in my own little room. At first I was only conscious of a deathly sick feeling; then I remembered that something had happened, something dreadful. What was it ? Ah !�Jack. I believe I called his name aloud; and then�oould it be true?� I heard his dear voice answering me, and felt his strong amis and his kisses on my face. It was no dream, hut Jack himself! I hid my face on his shoulder and sobbed. 1 have a dim remembranoe of hearing some one say, "Shell do now;" then the door was shut and we were alone. I had my arms round his neck, and clung closely to him, unwilling to loose my hold even to look up at nis face. 

 " Hush, Mary," he said�"hush, my darling. ! I am here, safe and sound. Look up, dear, i and see for yourself." 

 [ At last I did look up. Could that be Jack? 

 It .looked more like a badly-blacked Christy minstrel, " Why, Jack!" I cried, " you are as black as a" and I paused for want of a 

 simile. 

 "A Kettle7" ne suggested, "uome, little woman, don't call names. I fancy there's a pair of us," he added, looking laughingly at 

 me. 

 Of course I sat up at once, and looked to wards the glass to see what was the matter, and this is what I saw�Jack kneeling by the side of the couch, looking like a Badly-dishevel led sweep, for one of his shirt-sleeves was burnt off to the shoulder, and he was more or less black all'over; while bis eyes were red, and his teeth, displayed just now by a broad grin, shone like a negro's from beneath the singed and stubbly ends of what had once been his moustache. As for me, my light cotton dress 

 was ornamented by sundry prints of a human ' hand in black, while round my waist was a broad band of the same hue. My left cheek was one dark smear; while on the other, aa well as on my forehead and bps, were nume-' rous rough but unmistakable impressions of Jack's moustache. ... 

 It was no use trying to be sentimental under the circumstances, so I laughed instead, to Jaok's relief, for be had a man's hatred of 

 scenes. 

 " How did yon escapef' I asked. "I thought I saw the fire go over you." 

 "Why, so it did," he answered. "When I found I could not stop it, I lay down, and let it go over me." 

 " Oh Jack! you must have been hurt." 

 "Well, I found it rather warm certainly; and I am afraid my clothes have suffered. There, there, little wife; don't cry like that." The thought of his danger had been too much for me. " I am guite safe, thank God. I don't think I am seriously damaged, though my complexion is a little spoiled for the present. 

 He stayed talking a little while, and then had to rush back to his task. They had just managed to save the woolshed but a good deal of fencing bad gone. The worst of the fire was over, but it needed watching. 

 Next morning, a rather dilapidated but veiy happy bride and bridegroom started on their homeward way, after saying good-by to a still more dilapidated parson, ana bring honoured with three very husky (beers from all handB.
