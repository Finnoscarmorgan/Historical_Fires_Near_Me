 Jasper Jones, otherwise called Philoso �her Jones, chartered a barge in the 

 >erwent, on the estuary of which Hobart ie built. The barge bad always done . honest work, and though it had changed 

 hands several times the name was never ? disowned; From the first timber it was 

 the " King Billy." The master at the time of. our tale waB known familiarly as "Ted Conundrum. He had many of the good qualities of seamen and few of their failings. His temper was calm ; 

 his heart was kind. 

 Philosopher Jones was an ardent naturalist, religious by profession, iras- cible by common consent. The " Billy " was chartered to go to Port Davey, a little-known and inaccessible opening on the south-west . coast of Tasmania, the object being two-fold. Both parties had a separate hobby. Phil Jones waB in queer of botanical and -entomological novelties. Ted and his "retinue were 

 Srospectors. Their specialty was not 

 niited to any one mineral^ nor Indeed 

 evento minerals as a class. A famous pine affected 'this inhospitable area ; and though the whole - district was closed tcrthis industry, a tree in a convenient . situation would be legitimate mercban- ' 

 dise, and a' purchaser could easily be found, for there" was nothing like this "wptf�i�rVoat bnildirig. ? :

 - It's positively sepulchral," he muttered" 

 as he pressed his ear against a fold in ihe eail�o as io shut out the noise. It was eo leisurely and irregular in its slopping and gurgling, but there were no signs of abatement. It seemed to .dash up and �erne nearer at times,

 � "You're preti^bad, Philosopher, I 

 Bee" said Jack who was an Irishman with strabismus of the left eye. Then came a happy thought. It would be quite a different thing to betray some .weakness to a squinting Irishman from the same conduct before the captain. Then with indifference : 

 "By the way, what is that slopping 

 ind noise bf water down below f?? 

 "That's only the box of the centre board; that's nothing." 

 - This Brought, relief from anxiety; but It /only intensified the sickness. The mind returned with.unrestrained free . dom to the queer undulatory motions of

 The next dayl&ey sighted5 th�-rbcfcy � pillars that guard the entrance, and at sunset they entered the calm little bay. Hounding a miniature promontory 'moy found � Snug little core with afew yards of beach, Bisiog abruptly like ,a stern sentinel was Mt. Barry. The opening amidst the sculptured hills wound river- like inland into .the-unknown* The hills had a sleek smooth appearance with slight gullies furrowing their sides. In these grew a little scrub, and they 

 widened ia perspective downwards. The effect was novel, entirely unlike any other known parts of the coast-line. In the distance the slopes of the hills looked like a mown lawn, hut when climbed the bushes were found to be two or three feet high with an uneven surface. At. the base of. tbe_abrupt' bill there was everywheue a sufficiency of detritus to grow a few taller trees,, .and generally a thick shaded grove of scrub. The season being the end of January and the day fine, there was a -tempting calm about the spot. The place was entirely isolated ; there was no vestige of a road within thirty miles, and never - had been any, and, except for some mute memo- rials of whaling and "pining" days, 

 there were no tracks of white men. 

 Haying partaken of a meal, the first relished for two days-they had caught, a trumpeter, the finest of Australian fishes-they felt better, and resolved to go ashore.. . The: loneliness and the silence made the occasional " swish " of the wave on the mimic strand sound 

 weird and nncanny. Not a bird twit- tered. The bush of "nature -was in describable/ and the sense of ?' loneliness unique. The gathering^twilight -was1; like the covering hand of the Deity. The .crackle bf-a match under the captain's foot; in getting out of the dihghey made the Philosopher efcarfc-more than a cannan shot could have done in town! There was a little Tidge pf sand, crescent and parallel with the beach, on which there was little brushwood, except the graceful epacris. 

 _ The Philosopher stopped transfixed, with hands extended forwards and down- wards and eyes in the same direction. It could -hardly be a snake ; it was not horror so much as awe. . .The others crept up as if approaching a dying man. The obliterated outline of two graves, side by neide, was. the cause. Wooden slabs had been placed, in the Jong ago,, for headstones." One had rotted at the" base and fallen face downwards upon the dead man's breast, the Other was decayed and tottering to its fall.^ The short; hut simple annals pf the cbnipanionffin peace were almost indecipherable, especially in the fading light. Mghteen-forbj some- 

 thing was Ihe date, the last figure being - past recognition, l�o one spoke, and it was not awe iii the presence of the dead that chiefly, sealed their lips. There was ai. bid rast-eaten tin hetffieen ^the; two sleepers with withered wild flowers,

 of tenderness in> the iiearfc nf aome rough fisherman who had been �i-i ven in h�re by th�.iury of the sea; Ho who had done tills thing had ho possible know- ledge of or relationship to these outcasts. 

 It was their reverence for- theee un- known " twin r sleepers ".as human 

 brothers, that brought a Rightness , to their^hioats �ijuL teai-s ^o their eyes. They � l^eitence/ -thej; turned away grave as'if; they "had come ashore

 Philosopher visited the spot with less of awe in the more merry light, and noted the particulate. " Accidentally drowned in MacquavieHarbour," was tberecord oh one elah, the other, was past deciphering. 

 During the day they fossicked about, .finding traces of an old-time camp. These consisted of a luxuriant growth of musk, green and fragrant. They dug a shovel-full and placed it in the hold, whence it scented the whole ship. : They surveyed the mouth of Spring River and looked up the curious river-like passage that led np into Bathurst Harbour. The place was unsurveyeaV the chart was j vague and valueless, and the captain had never been np into it. Tow�rdsjdjisk a landward breeze enabled them^b^g^ up ; j 

 hut it was dark, and the rising: tulle on j either side were- shadoTwy^ and silent, 

 They. '.ua^^tiiU'.Bai^^aa^ had io takvj 

 soundings constantly. The. lapping.of the water -was the only sound The j Philosopher "was much, impressed. It suited hie mood. They called the pas- 

 sage the " River of Night." When they j came into what Appeared an opening ; sheet of water they toy to under a dark j hill. Their lamp on deck made, the eur-1 rounding darknees positively witching. 

 They turned in and wished'for the m�rh- i mg. . ^ 

 An unexpected wonder met their eyes I at daydawn; they �eemed to have: dropped down from the clouds into � mountain lake that was apparently cut i oft; from the world. This they explored during several days, chased and captured " moulters " (black swan), and then descended the River of Night and went across the opening to the Davey River. Here were remains of a dwelling, be- tween a hut and u cottage, a shore of boulders, and, mvrabiU diclu ! two doge. One was a fine black animal having some strain of a sheep dog, but with larger hanging ear�: tho other a yellow kangaroo dog. They got ibo King; Billy over the bar, anchored in tho ; 

 mouth of the river, and put out a boat for the dogs. They came on to a hugo hould^r, and, without timidity br invita- 

 tion, jumped into : the boat. Some j pickled beef .was brought out to test th�ir app�^ , " Day hold,!', said Jack, ah invitation quite unnecessary. ,And aa this.was'addressed to the black dog it'ethck^'Km^as-�-n�m'fe. The. other was known ai ''Hard Times?' he beuig 

 poorer and more/ ravenous than the 

 other. . There wan tittie game ,'escopt rate and badgers for them to ; catch for their rescuers, but they .were very welcome companion* during their- three weeks'stay, ... . . -, 

 There were many curious nooks.and rocky ledges to explore, full of interest" by being unknown, to the present generation at least. Pulling op the 

 river they passed through, a deep gorge, only a few feet wide, with perpendicular Bides, Their yoices rang as in.a cave; the water' was of unknown depths, the breeze rushed through, twilight reigned. "Hell Gates" is the name. Above an old fork was found and a pair of spec- tacles loBt. The former had been, doubtless, the property of some pmer in the old " pining " days ; the latter had this explanation. The Philosopher had climbed up the steep banks of the river. It was here a mere mountain rivine narrow and noisy, full of jutting rocks and deep pools. The others were testing the scanty bits of " wash " in some side eddy. Every little gully at right angles with the brook was largely concealed by the dense tangle of scrub, which, growing taller than"tue adjoining heaths and wattle bushes, made the country appear level. But these little miniature gorges were deep and steep. The chief plant formed a very " daeda- lus,", and is known as Bauern scrub (Bauera rubioides, the PMlospher called it). The slope of the bank was about fifty yards :ohJy, and the voices of the party below, could be heard in conversa- tion, . Jack Strabismus, unaccustomed 

 io the bush* stacia lighted match into a "grass-tree " with a tuft of dead leaves, and a roaring fire rushed :up the bank preceded by a. suffocating cloud of smoke from the green scrub. The Philosopher knew something of . the demon energy of bush fires, and made a wild rush in a slanting direction up. the river, ^Jwfc gravitating towaids the water. He was-a few yards ahead of the. origin pf the fir�. He knew it . would sweep upwards, and the feaifixl crackling of the names in the i tea-tree nibs paralysed rather than : quickened his energies. He flung him-! self madly forward on the ropy tangle, of one of .the numerous furrows. He, rolled and tumbled, sometimes actually hanging hy the heels. The smoke took sudden turns, and was only second to the actual flames. in deadly power. By a series of somersaults and the aid of the sharp slope he- managed io roll into the rivexv. The spectacles await a finder, who may not arrive for a century. Bules and regulations 'were formed for the lighting of fires henceforward, the main clause being that the lighter should know where every man was; and -give 

 notice of motion. 

 The prospectors prospected and the. philosopher botanised. The - fauna, ^specij^ 

 was-meiisi� ; J^t, in, addition to many 

 plants, the philosopher found a new moss, the generic name of JwEich was as the filing of a �aw to vulgar eal's, and the specific name, afterwards given by a professor in Finnland, was, naturally, Jon&ii, in honour of the .discoverer. 

 .When they returned finally to the river is mouth they devoted- a day to searching the nooks and patches of the fround about the hay. . Generally the 

 ushhad overgrown all traces of former occupancy ; but in addition to brakes of scented g�ranium, .they found an apple 

 tree of considerable size. It contrasted strangely with the native .vegetation. Coming .upon a rotted stratum of boards and scantling partly-covered in bracken {Pieris Aquilina said the Philosopher), they were curions to move some of it but were afraid of snakes. The exploring ihstanct prevailed and with the exception of lizards and centipedes they found no noxious thing, but they did find, flattened between two boards, what proved to be JIU old �ecket boot itinA once had an elastic Band, but this had crumbled and left only � trace. With great cave tihe Philosopher managed to separate some of the leaves and read fragments of ^trivial things. "The owner's name, app&red-tbJiave;be�n Kelley.. It was not for some weeks after that the philosopher found in this "ancient manuscript;-' a brief but clear history of the two graves. It ran thus:-"From the Waler Tasman too men was beride in the coav. They did fite at Macquarie Arber and Bodgei� hit Stavely over the
