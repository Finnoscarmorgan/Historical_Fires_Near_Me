 Bourgainvillae, Oct. 24, 1C08. 

 Dear Peter, � I wonder how you are now? Shearing o^er, and a good clip assured: a big Storm which has filed the tanks and made gree 1 the paddocks, and, perhaps, brought the suu caught splendour of buttercups nut among the grasses in the little pocket where we picnicked as children. Do you remember the 

 leaning tree, and the swing-bough? and the smell of crushed box- leaves, which is always associated- in my mind with the taste of mut ton sandwiches, somewhat dry, and tea hot and over-sweetened. Our lives are divided now, Peter, for I am going in for literature, and you are still on the station your forefathers held before you. The first Armltage to settle there was your grandfather, who, as a young man, trayelled up in a bullock dray, through uritrod bush ways, who blazed the 'rack which is now a fine road, to the banks of the creek, aa*. camping for water, built his slab hut there, and then his bark house, and, finally, the big weatherboard and iron roofed home that is yours to-day. I re member the' loopholes in the old harness room, which was once your grandfather's dining-room, where the old muzzle-loader (on whom the spiders draped their webs in my day) swung in a strip of green-hidf tack ed against the wall, tho rusty-barrelled thing that liad poured shot among the yelling tribe when the blacks stuck up the homestead be cause they wanted flour; aud, incidentally, took white men's lives. 1 I remember the flat grave with the wooden cross � two pine boards nailed together, where they buried your uncle who was brought home with a spear through his thigh, and who died from blood-poisoning because there were not even insurance doctors in the land In those days; and further, the mound, sweet ?with wild hoya and wattle overhung, whose whtte headstone was carried from the city by the toiling team, where your own dear mother sleeps through the drowsy summer days and the hushed, bloom-heavy nights. Your life has been lonely, Peter, an only son, alone Bince your father was drowned in the big flood of ninety; alone, in that house 'of me mories. But you: work hard; ^nd there -is not . an our.ce of sentiment in you, is there? That , Is why I like you so much; for a woman so rarely finds a man she can make a pal of � unless he is ages older, or younger, than her self, which spoils the interest-^f or one can't tako the same point of view then; and you and I always got on: so well,, didn't we? It; will be quite funny to feel we shall not see ?ach other for the inevitable Saturday, night to Monday morning of station visiting for months�if ever. For we have been chums ?? ' since the' time when we took! the sheepdogs' ' put to catch wallaby, and got 4d apiece for . the scalps, and nearly died of thirst one day, lost in the brlgalow. And. do you Temember the morning the bush - fires headed us off, and our .-powder-flask: blew up, and you lost- your. eyeiirowsv .No thing was saved of our kit but- the billy-bag with the lunch in it| which you had hung oni the lower bough of a blackbult, climbing up like an aboriginal, and tomahawking notches ' In the bark. Somehow, you always looked ; ?fter the lunch, didn't you, Peter? ' ? You would -laugh if you could -see me now, ? ' making coffee primly with a spirit lamp in my ' office in the morning, and- reading ? Rusk'in bo- ; tween bites of shredded wheat biscuits,- which. '. someone. I know tells roe. are good for the &i- : gcstion. We -never- bothered about digestion' then, did we, old pal? For- we -once ate. ?tewed curlew and roast porcupine. And do you remember thai' horrid nion: ing When, skirting the swamp, we saw that the reeds had- been- disturbed in one place, and, ' stretching out of' the -water, stiff rand stark, ? Was a man's arm,' 'clad in -a bl ue' shirt sleeve? . I can see. the brown gnarled fingers now, arid the glint of a woman's wedding ring on the ? little finger of the left hand� a worn iing: � ; which later, we heard, had the name 'Alice' ' graven inside it. We raced back, silent, with ? terror, as yet unfaced, in our heart and tear In pur child eyes, aud we met a boundary ?' rider near the. �hock-a.n-l-log, .and. sat him cantering across the nieloivholes to investigate 1 the still figure in the sandy-bottomed lagoon. ' 1 remember how blue the water was that morning:, how the black duck swam unheed ing by the opposite shore, how some French grey native companions danced a minoing quadrille in the. swamp� red bonnet aud amber eyes, with legs the colour of cast iron fresh from the fire. I remember the spring cart JJolting in, and the little trickle of water dripping from the tail-board � and the man who breathed not huddled in the bottom of the ? cart. 1 remember (he burial in tho paddock and Ibi? search for papers� anything to reveal his identity � in the swag they had discovered in the myall grove. Nothing transpired. The lagoon hid the secret of his last despairing ; minutes� and it became another mystery of the wide, mysterious bushland � but I some times wonder if 'Alice' � bride and wife � ' whose ring he wore � � .Out'.. I- must not. be sentimental, nor bring tho literary si-iipo loo much into my practical Ie1i-?r? . ? you. must. I? That is not in the bond. - ? ; '.:.;'''.?'.'-? it- a yrivate hotel now, having tried everything from furnished rooms -and 

 'find yourself' to the ordinary boarding- , house where one's private affairs are food for ; so much speculation on the part of the old ..! maid lodger. I have taken an office in a big newspaper building, where I do my journalis tie work and feel monarch of all I survey (which isu't much). But the thoughts be tween the bare, gravy-coloured walls are not anybody's thoughts but mine� nobody can break in and upset my composition at a cruci cal moment. As a rule 1he only person to intrude upon my solitude is the postman, and he is ever welcome, for he brings me letters from the bush, smelling of sandalwood and gum, with sometimes a spray of pressed wattle blossom, yellow and crisp, between the pages. And the other day I had a caller, of whom I must tell you. She walked with a depre- j eating feline tread into my untidy office. She i told me that she was a widow, and, in a flash, ! I seemed to see her husband, her antithesis, | large, lusty, and probably fond of drink. She told me she let furnished rooms, and belonged greatly to religiuub associa tions; she apologised for mentioning the fact but she thought I looked the sort of young ] person to require a nicely furnished room in I a Christian home, with the use of the bath. ! I could not see my 6x6 mirror from where ?. I sat, but I determined to peer into it as soon j as she departed, to know if I really did look like that. She weut on to point out the ad vantages of living in furnished rooms (in my pioneer days I was well acquainted with their disadvantages, but I said not so). She added that for a 'young person with a delicate stomach' there was nothing to compare with it, as one could choose o:io's own food. I be gan to fidget; do I look like that, too? 'lu boa: Ling-houses,' she said, with a sliake of j her pale-coloured, black-bonneted head, 'a j person with a weak inside caunot always eat u,e . sumptuous feasts they prepare' I in wardly chortled as 1 bent to readjust the typewriter, thinking of the 'sumptuous meals' of the ordinary boarding-house. Then j she asked me (I always find the truly Chris- j tian has an inquisitive tendency; or perhaps j she thought of saving me in time) did I have | a home in the city?. Sho eyed my boxes of | books, which lumber the office, with suspicion, thinking. I suppose, that they contained my all, and suspecting rolled-up bedding, my steriously disposed. 'Yes,'' I answered, smiling broadly, a knowing smile reminiscent of champagne suppers (I have only really tast ed champagne twice � once at a picnic and once at a girl friend's wedding), but I flattered my self that I looked a hardened supperist. '!I , live at an hotel,' I said; -with gusto.. Her pale, seamed face fell, her hands in the neat bi:uJv cotton gloves clutched her green leather hauubag. 'Oh, and do you like it?' 'It suits ine well,' said I. and looked late nighis and hilarious gatherings: I preferred to look that to a searcher for 'furnished -rooms and a sufferer from dyspepsia. . ? ... She glanced round again, at the rakish red veil on my hat, perched en top of. a .heavy ^illuetrnte.a Milton. ..She. had the sort of . glance that takes in everything, the trained glance of the domestic pryer. 1 expect she read the private letter that was on the roller of the machine, and saw that there- was no cork in my ink-pot. There never is. ...... ?' Faintand- holy was the illumination of her . thin features as she bowed -herself' out ..of my : door. _ ..'..,..,,_ 'Mine is a .truly Christian home,' she- said. : I heard the .tick-tack of -her feet in the long, ; cool passage. And I knew by the bajfied ex pression of her back- that she was completely pii/7.ied as to my standing and -occupation, it pujsk's-a let of people, I think. A man with a flower in his buttonhole. offered to give me. typing to do one day; he said he 'liked my looks,' which was: a - funny recommendation : for good work, but I shook iny head, and -he : went: empty, away� as far as gratified curiosity ; was concerned. The manager .of .the Newspaper Company stipulated only that 1 should not. take pupils tor the piano when T. ep.gag-.id my room, as it would -disturb the solicitors on 'the: same floor. I promised that ' easily� for, you Jc-now. I �an-'t play a, note� ? and as long as my rent comes in'j-egiilarJy he ; does Hoi care whether I am a female burglar or a coiner in disguise;- ? so; I -rattle away at. my machine, and dream of the success which : still hangs. fir-- From the. litUe iron; balcony . at the back of this monster building I can see ' a cloud of.delleate lilac; . JSca.randas tn a city ..' garden.' They were' .late 'in blossoming- this ? year ; the '' winter ' h^s been Ions. ' I ? wonder whether +he banksias i-!v: eonilug on in yo.Jii gardetv-T Or, .'bacbeioivHke, are;you-negle;rHKg .' your g-arden ' in favour of -the- new sheep- aud' cattle dip you wore telling ?ue about. !�. your last letter? ? It must be yr-ry interesting To fe�l one ha3 discovered something; 'but I do not forget the roses altogether; the dear, ' biiri'-'hy yellow and -White bauksia. that look -so pn-tty drooping from the dark shingles. I - w:is always so glad you did not ' cover that part of the old roof with brand new galvanis ed, iron. . : . : ; Ami now, good-bye. I will write, to; you again before' Christmas. Your very true friend, MOIRA BARRY. ? ? * * * Red *ock Station, Nov. 10. 1908. My dear Moira.� I was glad to get yoi:r letter, and to hear that you were all right, in spue of. district visitors. Yes, tho sheep dip is Al. I am going to have a demonstration soon, and expect to make a good thing of it. But I think I. shall have to chop away the banltsia; you sec it is rotting that old roof; besides I really think that would be better for being replaced with iron before the wet season sets in. Tell. me your notions when you write again. I always like to oblige an old chum; but. as. you say. neither of us believe i-j tont.ment. and roses art- sentiment, are the- not? You can't eat them, you know. 1 am h-iviiijt the house dono up a little. Wool is going to pay this year. There are plenty of foreign buyers at the s^les. and 3O.ue niut.1 'rings of- war in the Easi, which a�vays send up prices. It's an ill wind; etc. 

 But, old girl, aren't you lonely sometimes at i your hotel, and does a latch-key compensate? Some day, perhaps, I shall walk into your little office and surprise you, bringing inhar monious thoughts into your peaceful musings.. I am no hand at letters, you know; would much rather talk face to face. So, good-bye, and don't forget to let me know what you would like for a Christmas-box; we know each other well enough not to be shy about that. A chap found some Oliviue rock on the run the other day; a queer cove, a bit of a geologist, who was passing through, and I thought I would get enough cut at the jewel lers in the city to make you something; but, just say. Yours ever sincerely, PETER ARMITAGE. ****** Bourgainvillae, Nov. 27, 1908. Dear Peter, � Oh, leave the roses and the shingle roof. Perhaps I shall never see them again, but I like to think they are there� creamy-hearted or snow-budded. Bother the wet season. Put tubs under the leaks. Yes; I am lonely; but women with a career always are. When success comes I shall not mind the loneliness. Thank you so much for what you said about the Olivines. I love them� St. Thomas the Martyr's stone� though then, they called it the peridot, and he wore one on his finger, when driven to bay by unbe lievers he fell upon their swords � can't you picture the glint of its green eye on his white priestly hands� and the gloating of the paid assassins? But there; . I expect you are laughing. 'How does sh;- expect a sho^p and cattle man to remember old legends' � and you� what am I to give you for a Christmas present? It is so hard to choose things for men who don't smoke � and you don't much care for books. Tell me exactly what you want most wheu you write again. I am busy and h?adachy to-day. Yes; it would be much nicer to have one of o;ir old talks, you in the squatter chair � me swinging in. the hammock under thr- butterfly leaves of the bauhinia. I will not writ'? any more this mail. But remain, ever your Friend. MOIRA. * * * * * Red. Rock Station. Dec. 7, 1908. :viy dear Moira, � Tho banksia and shingle roof shall stand � as long as the roof holds together. The sheep-dip was a failure. It only made the ticks morn lively. I sent the olivines down last mail to B ? , the jeweller. Call and have thorn set as you like. One of the hands met with' a. nasty accident rounding up scrubbers last, night, and I am just going to drive him in to the hospital. What are you doins: for Christmas? Yours, in great haste, PETER. * * ? * * * ?' Telegram' from Miss Moira Barry, Bour gainvillae, December 15. to Mr. Peter Armit '.as;e,..Red Rock, -Cactus. Sldj7ig:� 'Lot me know what yon want most.
