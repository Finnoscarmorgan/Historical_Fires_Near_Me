 CHAPTER I.�THE BLACK OX. 

 It had been raining fiercely � that is a mild term for some Australian rain � all the dreary night. The cold south-west wind, fresh from the ice-plains of the Antarctic, had been blowing over 

 the City of the South since the evening of the previous day, had set in piercing, damp, and miserable. The few who were compelled by business or pleasure � the latter has sometimes a great deal of compulsion� to be out, had got in again as soon as possible. In to the shelter at their command. Into luxurious drawing-rooms in fashionable suburbs ; into snug dining-rooms in homes of a lesser degree; into warm smoking-rooms of swell hotels ; into snug parlours in comfortable second-class pubs ; into boarding-houses ; into boozing-kens ; into flash-cribs ; into stables ; into sheds ; into boilers on the public wharves ; into temporary shelters under the lee side of walls ; into half-built houses; into anywhere where there was some defence from the pitiless, pelting rain. At midnight when the theatres were over, there had been a sort of spasmodic shock of population in the streets. From the re- cently-erected Royal had come forth male and female figures, all evidently disliking the weather ; all more or less under the influence of Bacchus. There had been festive parties in oyster-saloons, merry gatherings of the hap- hazard-don't-know-who-your-friend-is-but-he-is- evidently-a-good-fellow sort, in back rooms of late houses, kept select by knowing landlords for the favoured few. Night cabs had been hastily summoned, cloaked forms had been hurried in, mysterious communications had been made to drivers. Small parties of suburban pleasure- seekers had hurried away to catch the latest cabs at the corner of Prince's bridge, and faint scraps of conversation such as� " Wasn't Warner good in the ' Corsican Brothers ?' how pretty that last scene was," had been caught here and there by the passers-by. One o'clock, and the spasmodic gathering had ceased, to give place to a thin sprinkling of the regular night birds � a thin sprinkling, for the night was too bad even for them, and there was generally some sort of shelter to be had about Melbourne. Two o'clock, and the rain had not ceased to fall, coming down steadily, unremittingly, cruelly, with a persistency almost savage, well backed up by the fierce biting blasts of the ice-fields. Out- side the barracks, the sentry stood at ease in his sentry-box, muffled up in his great coat, looking out on the misty prospect, and wishing sincerely that the relief would come round by some mistake earlier than usual. Even into his snug sentry-box the rain would penetrate; and it beat with positively ill-bred rudeness against the lighted windows of a room in the barrack square where a party of officers and their friends were keeping it up. Captain Baring Barrington, off escort- duty now, and quartered in Melbourne, was giving a small party. It had been guest-night at the mess, and some dozen or so of choice spirits had remained behind to finish the night in Barrington's quarters. Three years had passed away since he had read the news of Sir Maudesly's death, and Baring Barrington was a very much changed man indeed. In the first place, he had loved Lucy Herbert considerably more than his cold, proud nature allowed him to admit, even to himself. In the second place, there was no plotting and scheming to be done so far as the acquisition of Baring Chase was concerned. It was� not� so soon as he read the letter � Baring Chase that was to be sought, but Pierce Charlton. Pierce Charlton, so far as he could make out, was in America ; at least, so his unknown correspondent, who en- closed a letter from that young gentleman, had informed him � and would have nothing more to say to Miss Barrington, the betrothed of Sir Maudesly Charlton, the Black Knight, who had since then so conveniently moved off the boards. He had made enquiries, he had caused letters to be written, he had inserted cautiously-worded advertisements in the papers, and still had been able to find out nothing. Three years had passed away. He was still a captain ; Maude was still living, sometimes with some friends, sometimes with the Misses Singteton as a lodger, but 

 always asking Baring to let her come out to him. Pierce Charlton was not to be found, and what was more, Baring knew his old pupil well enough to feel certain that even if he were found, it would not be so easy to induce him to repeat his former offer as long as the faintest suspicion rested in his mind that Maude had raged the suit his uncle. The clever captain knew Pierce's fierce impetuous temper well, and felt certain that after the knowledge of the first plot, the young heir of Charltonleigh would be only too ready to suspect the existence of another. So he had been very cautious and diplomatic in his movements. He had made all his enquiries through agents that he could trust, and except in New York, had not called in the assistance of the police. But nothing had come of it, and as on that wet, stormy morning in July, 1857, he sat at a loo table, eagerly interested in the game, he had no more idea of where Pierce Charlton was than when he first started on the chase, and was a very much changed man indeed. The eyes were as dark and bright as ever, the hair as free from grey, but under those dark eyes the circles were even darker, and the lines about the mouth were far deeper than the age of the man warranted. The face was, fuller too, here and there were marks of a dissipation that Barrington had not hitherto indulged in. The man had, in fact, degenerated. Now that his game regarding Baring Chase was safe, so far as chance could make it safe, and Maude was provided for, there had been a cessation of the intense brotherly love he had been wont to feel. Some day� and soon, he felt� Pierce would be found. He would explain everything then, and the marriage would take place. Maude would have Baring Chase, and he Lady Charlton, and he� well, no, he wouldn't have Baring Chase. Lucy Herbert would not be his wife � she could never be his at all � and the whole scheme seemed to lose value in his eyes. The hope of gaining Lucy had given a tenderer tone to the aspirations of his ambitious nature ; but that gone, and replaced by a tolerable certainty that the other object of his plans would be attained soon, the material portion of his being had come more strongly into play. He had been fond of his sister � he was fond of her still � but, somehow or other, though he had first set the boat afloat, he had never been able to forgive her love for Pierce. Until then, he had been the first idol in that young heart, and he had never quite relished the supplanting. Then he had loved Lucy Herbert, and been refused. Was he never to be wholly loved at all ? Was he only to come in for the wine on the lees of sisterly affection � to give place always to another ? Such a secondary position by no means suited Baring Barrington ; and so, while still prosecuting his search for the missing baronet, he went in for dissipation far more heavily than he had ever done before. Naturally clever and sarcastically amusing, he soon made himself a favourite, and it was not long before a night in Barrington's rooms was con- sidered one of the institutions of the barracks It was not quite all he had once dreamed of ; but it was better than the lonely days an the solitary quarters in years gone by. He had money to. hold his own with now � money to send home to Maude. Maude, too, would be rich by-and-by � Baring Chase would be hers ; Lucy Herbert could never be his; and why should he not enjoy himself ? He took kindly to this Epicurean philosophy � far more kindly than he could once have imagined possible ; and so, on that wet, cold morning of July, 1857, sat at the loo-table in his quarters, merrier than them all. Outside all was dreariness, dampness, and misery ; inside all was jollity, warmth, and com- fort. Just in front of the sentry the figure of a man buttoned up to the throat in a pilot coat, but wet through, drenched to the skin, stopped and looked up at the lighted windows � stopped and listened to the voices and laughter. The rain rattled on the roof, the wind-howled through the trees of the neighbouring Domain, but still, at intervals, this wet, shivering man could hear the laughter and the voices. He looked for a second wistfully at the light, and then, drawing near to the sentry, said � " Whose are those quarters, sentry ?" The speaker was drenched to the skin, and by no means fashionably dressed ; but no one tells a gentleman more quickly than a soldier. Standing mechanically to attention, the man replied � " Captain Barrington's, sir. Some of the ser- vants is up, sir, if you wish to get in." "Not I," was the half savage answer ; and, with a muttered curse, the drenched figure walked away. Walked away over the bridge, past the con- stable � shrinking back for a moment's shelter in a recess as a gust of wind blew the rain more fiercely in his face � past a night-house near the bridge, where some thirsty cabmen were being treated by a belated and excessively intoxicated fare � past the Police Court and Town Hall � past another lighted night-house, up Swanston street, now completely deserted, and so, plashingly, wearily, drippingly into North Melbourne, down two or three muddy streets into a muddier right-of-way, and up to the door of a small wooden house. Then the drenched figure stopped and knocked gently at the door. A moment of silence, a dim light, and then a soft voice said � "Who is there ?" 

 " Charles," was the answer ; and the door was opened. Opened to show a small room, the only furni- ture of which was a table and a few chairs, while through another open door could be seen a bed. There was no fire on the hearth, and nothing on the table ; and standing by the door was a woman with a child in her arms. Very pale, thin, and worn, but still young and pretty � still tender and loving� still Lucy Ashton, who had vowed to love, honour, and obey the drenched, dripping figure she was open- ing the door to. " You at last, Charley," she said, as she stood by the open door. " I am so glad, darling. It rained so, and I got so frightened. What made you so late ?" The man she spoke to threw his arm round her, pressed his lips to hers, and then, shutting the door, looked round the room. Cold, dreary cer- tainly, but still home. Lucy went into the inner room, placed the child on the bed, and came out again, " You are wet through, Charley, dear," she said; " and there are no dry clothes. You must get to bed at once." Charley flung his hat on to a chair, and removing his coat, stood in his shirt-sleeves, still wringing wet. " Charley, where is your waistcoat, and what kept you so late ?" The face that had looked up at the lights in Captain Barrington's quarters was the face of Charles Ashton ; but it was a very stern set face indeed. Now, as it looked down into the loving face that looked up even more lovingly into it, all the sternness had faded away. Wet, weary as he was, he threw his arms round his young wife, and drawing her towards him, forget it all as he said � " I went to try and get a job, Lucy � curious term, isn't it ? � and I couldn't. One fellow told me I didn't look like a working man, and another said he didn't want any hands, and another�� oh, what's it matter what the other said. Any- how, there was nothing to be done, and I wandered about till nearly breakfast, and then I remembered there was nothing for breakfast for you and the boy, and so I went � I went � and left my waistcoat where my watch and your jewels, Lucy, and all have been left." " Oh ! Charley, darling, and you so wet. We had enough. There is enough left for to-morrow. There is some bread for you even now, if you will eat it ; and I think a man will bring some wood to-morrow. Oh ! Charley, darling, why will you take so little care of yourself � why sacrifice so much for me ?" Wet, mud-bespattered, famine-worn as he was, Charles Ashton had still much of the comeliness of three years back ; but he looked more than handsome as, with a voice trembling with emotion, he answered his wife. His was one of those curious complex natures which most attract and most attach women. He could not speak in any way but kindly to any woman � in any way but lovingly to the woman he loved. He might perhaps cease to love � might forget � might even neglect; but never speak unkindly. But there was no cessation of love in this case. "My own darling," he replied, " never talk of sacrifice to me. I have married you to ruin and poverty, and brought my boy to share it. What is there I would not do for either of you? I feel neither cold nor hunger when I am with you. You are home, warmth, light, all � my own wife, my darling, who took me out of the slough of despond. What have I to care for but you ? " Closer and closer the thin white arms were clasped round his neck, and the loving lips were pressed close to his. Ruin, cold, hunger � all were forgotten ; and as he gently disengaged himself from her embrace, there was more of the old Charles Ashton in his look than there had been for many a day. He ate the cold meat and bread she placed before him ; for, after he had given her the money he had received for his waistcoat, he knew that a refusal would only pain her ; but that done, he insisted on her going to bed. "I must dry these things for to-morrow, darling," he said, "and then I will come to bed." She gave him one more kiss, and went into the inner loom. When she had gone, the whole look of the husband changed, and, with a savage curse, he flung himself into a chair, a moody scowl louring on his handsome features. Only three years � two years and a half of comfort and happiness, and six months of drudgery A bad season had carried off half the money he and John Herbert had invested ; then, during John's absence, a bush fire had destroyed the homestead � still uninsured � at Lal-Lal ; then poor John � oh ! how bitterly wept for by Lucy � had died, far away on the Darling, struck down by fever ; then they had come to town, and Ashton had tried his fortune there. But in those busy, hurrying times, when capital was gone, it was not so easy to retrieve a lost fortune. For months, too, Ashton lay on a sick bed. Lucy's old friends had nothing more to give but empty sympathy, and a remark that they wondered how John Herbert had ever allowed his sister to marry a stranger of whom nobody knew anything. Then, when he recovered, Ashton had sought for work everywhere � sought for it as only a desperate man could seek ; and, in the midst of all, their baby, born a year after marriage, fell ill. Lucy, worn out with nursing, was nearly as bad, and for weeks, while earning a precarious 

 livelihood as a porter in the daytime, Ashton was sick-nurse at night. It had been a hard trying time throughout, and only once had the husband shown a sign even of impatience. It was when Lucy had asked him to write to his friends at home. " Friends, Lucy," he had replied ; " I have no friends. I told you and poor John so when I married. Since that day I have never even looked at an English newspaper, and I never will. My home and my life are here with you and the boy." And Lucy kissed him, and loved him, if possible, more than ever. But love and kisses had not kept out the steady tramp of the Black Ox, and now he was close at their door. A very grim-looking animal indeed. Everything of value they had was gone, and now it had come to this, the pawning of their clothes. " A man would come with the wood to- morrow," poor Lucy had said ; and Ashton knew very well, though he had kept it from her, that a man with a paper would come to-morrow, and that, unless the rent was paid, they stood a fair chance of being turned into the street. A pleasant prospect certainly, and for nearly an hour the man whose' clothes were still damp and chilly sat brooding over it, while his handsome features assumed an expression of positive ferocity. Then he hung up some of his wet clothes to dry, and crept to bed shiveringly, muttering decidedly unpleasant threats towards the man with the paper ; crept to bed shiveringly just about the time that Captain Barrington, having seen the last of his guests out, was counting his winnings and leisurely undressing himself before a cheerily- burning fire. CHAPTER II.�RUINED. Six o'clock, and now, through the still heavily falling rain, damp, sodden-looking figures tramped - through the mud to their daily toil for the mere pittance to keep body and soul together, a necessity that existed quite as much in the golden City of the South as it had done in crowded London. Few of those figures but had at home read with eager hearts the tales of how fortunes were made, how men poor at night and therefore weak, rose up rich in in the morning and there- fore strong. How a mere stroke of the pick would unearth a yellow lump that would be a fortune ; would bring rest and comfort for life, immunity from all work and anxiety. Few but had throughout the long voyage dreamed light dreams of future prosperity, when all was to be plenty and riches, when the words hunger and care would have no signification but as words. The rich man has many objects of desire that his riches cannot bring ; but the poor man, unless rich in peculiar self-comforting resources not granted to the human race generally, has but one hope � riches. He has seen through his ill-cared-for life what riches can do. He has seen that the possession of gold will give a man what he cannot get, clothes, food, shelter, and troops of at least seeming friends, which to the friendless seem better than none. He has seen that acts for which he is scouted and condemned, can be per- formed by the rich man with comparative im- punity. He has seen that the yellow robe of Plutus will cover more sins from human eyes than charity can hide from angels. What wonder, then, if to him riches are the sum- mum bonum of earthly happiness, the Nieberlunger of his earthly pilgrimage. It is easy to tell a poor man of his chances in the next world, into which the rich man will not so easily penetrate ; but cold and hunger are bitter teachers, and the man to whom this doctrine is preached, has seen gold do so much here, that he may be even pardoned for doubting that it will lose its influence hereafter. Some of the figures hurrying through the rain were earning wages which to a labourer in the old country would have seemed lavish indeed. But the difference in the price of provisions was considerable ; house-rent was high ; and though the working man in constant employ was beyond all denial far better off than his English compeer, still if he had a large family, the struggle to keep body and soul together was a tough one, breaking down many a strong spirit, wearying out many a gallant heart. Others again among that damp-looking ! crowd were not so well off. Skilled mechanism or rough labour commanded then, as it always will, its price. The instructed and the strong hand were alike well rewarded, but it was merely the instruction and the strength of the body. There was a class numerously re- presented in the throng that plashed along the muddy streets on that wet July morning, the members of which were miserably paid, poorly clad, and not over-well fed or housed. Men there who had held the position of junior mercantile clerks at home, and had come to the land of gold in the hope to better themselves, the constant hope of the man who works for his living. Those who came first, when the rush of everybody to the newly-discovered diggings left Melbourne nearly empty, were, naturally, first served, and well served too. Merchants, lawyers, et hoc genus omne , were only too glad to get hold of tolerably well educated, intelligent men, and high salaries were at the disposal of all who would be of the slightest use in an office either legal or mercantile. The good seed of this crop grew and flourished, the tares went to the bad. They would have gone to the bad at home, and they went to the 

 bad in Victoria, only perhaps a little more speedily; for the hill of rain in those early days was steep indeed, and the wheels of dissipation rolled merrily to the gulf below, laghing to scorn all the drags and chains of morality and respectability. Those who did not come first, however, were not so well served by any means. A comparative lull took place in the gold returns about three years after their first starting, an ambitious wielders of the pen, legal or mercantile, coming out to seek good salaries and rapid fortunes, found the high places of the land occupied; the purple and fine linen all purchased. It was not the sort of thing they had been led to expect. Wages were to be earned certainly, but only a little higher than at home, and provision, etc., were unpleasantly dear. And so they grumbled and grumbled, and wrote letters of reproach to those who had advised them to emigrate. Some of the more sensible and most easily contented seized eagerly upon any situation that offered itself, and by dint of the old plodding exertions, that had kept the wolf from the door in the old country, managed to push slowly on in the new. Others, more eager and adventurous, rode out boldly to Eldorado, intending to return clad in golden armour, or not at all. A few did return so clad triumphantly and joyously ; more returned not at all, but after a gallant fight with the giants Want and Hunger, succumbed by the road-side, never to be heard of again ; and most returned cowed and defeated, some ready to do the humblest work at the lowest wage, and others to sink into members of the class known to the Victorian as " loafers," unwashed, dirty, hopeless, and drunken. Such a lot was had enough indeed, but there were others who fared far worse, inasmuch as their fall was from a greater height. The torture of Lucifer was more deeply felt than that of the other stricken ones, who clashed spear against shield in the gloomy assembly of Pandemonium. Supreme ruler as he was there, there rankled in the proud heart of the mighty spirit on the sombre throne a torture to which the bite of serpents and the burning of flames were as nothing. The haughty, handsome features scarred by the lightning of the conqueror, were covered with a sullen gloom that nothing could remove. It was not the pain, not the scars; but the knowledge that he had been conquered, and the haughty spirit that had sneered at the "limitary cherub," writhed under the consciousness that elsewhere, if not in Hades, there was One mightier than he. He ruled in hell, but it was only as a viceregent after all. He had fallen from the greatest height, and his wound had been the sorest. So with the fallen from a high estate amongst us. There were many more than there are now-a- days, who came out here, but little fitted for the life before them. Among these, too, there were certainly some younger sons of good old families, who, tired of the younger brother's role at home, even as bold Sir Walter Raleigh, care not to settle down into the younger son of a Devonshire squire, sought with what little capital they could command, to win fortune amid the wild pasturages of Australia. On many a lonely sheep station, in many a lonely hut, at the foot of the high ranges where the cattle roamed UN- yarded, have spirits of this order struggled and fought on towards the goal they had set up for themselves. Some were successful ; others, who were not, but whose bold blood was still unchecked, tried fickle fortune once more at the diggings, made money enough to retrieve their losses, tried the old station work again, and this time succeeded. But in this class there were far more who came to a lamentable end, to very sad days indeed. With no profession to fall back upon, with health and strength beaten down by the two or three succes- sive failures, with money gone and courage spent, they fell to lower depths than the others. Unable in many instances to procure manual work, incapable of settled labour, such, too generally roamed about the country " on the wallaby," seeking employment and finding none, eating where they could, sleeping wherever shelter was obtainable, more commonly without any, shelter at all, and dying whenever sickness attacked them, among strangers, un-nursed, uncared for, and unwept. Others, perhaps even lower than these, spunged upon their friends as long as they could, and then utterly degraded, perched with the vilest of the night-birds, a mock and a jeer even to them.
