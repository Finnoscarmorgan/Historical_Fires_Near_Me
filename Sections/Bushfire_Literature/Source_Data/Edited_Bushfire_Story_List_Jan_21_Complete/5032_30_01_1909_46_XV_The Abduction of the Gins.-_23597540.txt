OUR BOY'S SERIAL. 

 THE UNDULLA. 

 CHAPTER XV.-The Abduction of the Gins.-(Continued) 

 By "BULLOO," 

 Soon after dark a very old black stood near a large fire which had been lighted in an open space, and placing his hands to his mouth 

 uttered a loud cooee. There was no reply. Again the veteran raised his unmelodious voice and listened keenly, when a faint response was heard apparently coming from a considerable distance. A third long drawn appeal was answered imme- diately, and the performers advanced towards the fire four deep, at the double. The ancient warrior strode proudly back to his place amongst his compeers and the male members of the tribe who were too young, or for other sufficient reasons were un- able to take part. The corroboree fire was blazing brightly in the centre of an open space denuded of bushes and long grass, constantly fed by old Bootha and a few other gins. The audience sat in a semicircle facing the fire, the gins and old men forming the orchestra, the accom- paniment being produced from nullas clashed upon boomerangs, or from two of the latter. The scene was a striking one which has never been done justice to by any artist in oil or water colours, perhaps because none have witnessed a corroboree performed by over a hundred men whose tastes had not been vitiated by thr stepdancing of the whites, each per- former being decorated according to his own fancy. The glare of the fire illumined the gaunt white stems of the gumtrees fringing the river bank, at the same time providing a deeply dark background, while the eager spectators grouped in front of the lire, with the bizarre looking performers between formed a unique spectacle to be found only in Australia. Woorlian, who had been assisted In his preparations by two friends, presented a most startling sight. His hair had been fluffed out all round, and decked with pieces of swansdown, with two tail feathers of the spoonbill standing erect. A splash of white ran across his forehead, with two dabs of the same colour on his cheeks, the eyes being encircled with blue. His breast dis- played a red and white rising sun, his arms bore a white streak back and front, while his stomach was barred with white. Spiral coils of white and red traversed his legs from hip to foot. The ribs were traced with white, on his back, with two big dabs lower down, which completed this ex- traordinary piece of personal de- coration. The chief was proud of the work and exhibited his satis- faction openly, glancing at Charlie to noticr the effect on him. White and red were the colours used by the other men, it being evi- dent Woorlian was sole possessor of the blue pigment, which Charlie later on discovered to be a piece of that substance employed by white women in washing. The greatest variety of design was displayed, doing credit to their imagination, but a favourite one was to mark the body with white in imitation of a skeleton. The men were drawn up two deep and opened the proceedings by stamping right and left feet alter- nately to a monotonous chant. This was invariably acted, and may be regarded as a stock over- ture. Then followed the favourite dance, in which the legs were stretched wide apart In a crouching position while the bodies were jerked erect, causing the muscles of the thigh to quiver. Representations of kangaroos hopping and emus feed- ing were given, when a short rest was observed in preparation of a new act to which Bulilla and his men were the sole performers. A large black-fellow, with face whitened to represent Charlie with two others was placed in a con- spicuous position, and all supposed \\o be asleep. Shortly Bulilla and his party were seen to be approach- ing stealthily examining the ground with greatly exaggerated action until they came close to the sleepers when they threw themselves upon them. A terrific struggle ensued in which the attacked made the most violent but vain efforts to free themselves. This scene aroused the audience to a pitch al wild enthu- siasm which when Bully's discom- fiture was portrayed became frantic. More than one encore was demanded but it was only once repeated, as it would probably be reproduced for several evenings. Then a representation of the ab- duction of the gins by the wife hunters was given, some lads, only too willing, acting the part of the young gins. It was a clever piece of work and was warmly received. This brouarht the evening's drama- tic performance to an end. when an undignified rush was made for the banquet. As the performers had purposely eaten nothing since sun- rise their prodigious appetites were only equalled by the enormous sup- plies of food consumed. Then followed the lethargy of re- pletion, and the savages lay by their firesides in a somnolent state until partial digestion-enab led them to fall sound a sleep. 

 Soon after midnight the camp was wrapped in silence only dis- turbed occasionally by the stentorous snoring of some-overgprged sav- age, for even the dogs had eaten their fill und slumbered near their mistresses. Whether a knowledge of Bully's prowess had been Instinctively acquired by the camp dogs or their mistresses had imparted it to them cannot be said, but whatever the cause the bulldog was left severely alone, at which he was apparently quite unconcerned. Charlie gradually fell into the ways of the camp so far as obtaining food and joining in the amusements went. Bogung was allowed to accompany him while hunting, while Bootha supplied him with roots and herbs. Woorlian acquired a strong liking for the white lad, and they often hunted to- gether, the former being surprised at Charlie's proficiency in stalking. The revolver was not used in pro- curing game, as the ammunition might be required for purpose of attack or defence, so that in a few weeks the lad became an adept in the use of the nulla and tomahawk, though he never became an expert with the spear. Although Charlie had seen a good deal of the Murray blacks he had never had such an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the real home life of the aborigines pre- viously, and was surprised to find that in an elemental way they had as many jealousies and petty intri- gues as the whites. There were the same striving for power and influence, and the same social in- trigues, though the violation of some of the tribal laws, including murder, was visited with capital punishment. Now and again diluted rumours of increased white settlement in the interior reached him, raising hopes of speedy deliverance in his mind, until they gave place to despair. CHAPTER XVI,� Tirpuli and Yanara. None of the rumours of approach- ing white settlement having been confirmed, Charlie gradually lost hope of being rescued, and pursued his daily avocation of hunting stren- uously in order that fatigue of the body might dull the irritation of ths mind, and was more or less success- ful, for as a rule he slept like a log from an hour after sundown to daybreak. But the life was mono- tonous, and he wearied of it. An- other object he had in taking so much exercise was that when the opportunity for escape arrived he would be in first-rate condition for walking or running. One morning he perceived some- thing had happened to disturb the usual drowsy serenity of the camp, and he sent Bogung to ascertain the cause. On the boy's return he said that a young gin, Yanara, who had been promised to an old warrior, had disappeared, and as a young man named Tirpuli was also unaccount- ably absent it was suspected they had absconded together. The old warrior Karingara was furious, as were also the gin's parents, for they had expected to receive valuable presents, and now the hopes of all were dashed to the ground. As the marriage had not been com- pleted�for the gifts had not been handed over�no one had any right to punish the girl except her father, and he would not be likely to give her more than a sound thrashing, so a number of the men who thought she should suffer condign punish- ment as an object lesson to others urged Karingara to complete the purchase so as to make her his wife, and set after her himself, two or three offering to accompany him. At length, half maddened by dis- appointment and the jeers of the younger men, he consented, and ac- companied by some friends bore a 'possum rug, a stone axe, and a flint knife as presents, as they were termed, in exchange for Yanara. With a professed reluctance the price was accepted,, and the mortified suitor, together with two friends, started after the runaways. The tracks were picked up a quarter of a mile from the camp in some sandy ground, when it was dis- covered the guilty pair wore feather slippers. It being evident the the tracking would be a slow and diffi- cult matter, Karingara's friends left him to his own devices at midday and returned to the camp. Meanwhile the fugitives had fled swiftly during the night, for although the blacks dread being away from the camp after nightfall, under certain circumstances, they do not hesitate to face the powers of dark- ness. With fear and trembling, especially on the part of Yanara, they sped on their way towards the ranges, which they hoped to reach by the follow- ing evening. At first they uttered no sound, but as they got further away from the camp they discussed the position. "Old Karingara has nothing to do with you," said the young fellow earnestly. "He had not given the presents, and your father could have given you to me if he had liked. Why could he not have allowed me to pay for you by degrees ? I could have done it in six moons. But no, he must have an alliance with that wombat-faced old dingo. "But Karingara may help my father to hunt us down." replied the gin. 

 "Let him. He'll never see the way we go. Our feather slippers will hardly leave a mark on the dry plains, while on the ridges our tracks will be invisible." "But they say Kuringara can al- most smell one's tracks, "Can he ? Well, his nose is big enough, but I don't believe it all the same. I'll back myself against him any day, either in tracking or hiding tracks." "How long do you think we must keep away ?" inquired the gin. "Two moons will be sufficient. They can only punish me then, and I can take all' they can give me. Won't old Karingara be mad, the old rat?" A long Bilence ensued until the moon rose, when, inspirited by her rays, they fitfully resumed their con- versation, though pressing on all the time. It was a glorious night. The moon a little past the full, rose from a horizon as treeless as the sea through a sky devoid of clouds. The silence was intense, for there being no forest timber nocturnal life was absent, so that beyond the brushing of their feet through the tussocks of long grass nothing was heard ex- cept the infrequent rustling wings of a night bird, or the faint whish of a wild duck hurrying to new waters. About midnight the fugitives rested at some crab holes recently filled by a passing shower. Lying at full length on their backs they drew long breaths until they felt relieved, when they rose, and having taken a hearty drink hurried on. Being unaware of the marriage hav- ing been completed, they felt the 

 irate father would endeavour to catch them before the two moons prescribed had passed, when, if he was successful, the girl would still be his property, and Tirpuli would be severely punished. Had the girl been actually Karingara's wife they would both be liable to the penalty of death. On the other hand, if they succeeded in eluding capture, and pre- sented themselves to the authorities, the gin would remain Tirpuli's wife, but he would have to pay for her as soon as he could reasonably be ex- pected to do so. Tirpuli would also be liable to corporal punishment un- less he bought immunity from the girl's father. The night passed, and with the cool fresh air, the sun from the moment of its rising pouring its heated rays on to the plains. In two hours Yanara's strength began to fail, and Tirpuli called a halt in the meagre shade of a goombunye bush." "I am nearly done, Tirpuli," she exclaimed. "My legs are becoming numbed, my heart is beating hard, and my eyes are getting dim ; I cannot go any further, and we shall be overtaken." "We have lots of time," replied Tirpuli cheerfully. "We have had fully twelve hours' start of them, perhaps more. Are you quite sure you did not give any of the girls a hint of our course ? Not even your great mate Moona ?" "Not a word to any. I knew it might cost you your life, and I kept it deep in my own heart." "You are a good girl, Yanara. and you will never regret being my wife." A long silence ensued, and when the young gin had somewhat recover- ed her strength she continued; <38) 

 "How long will it be, Tirpuli, before you buy another wife ?" "Time enough to think of that, girl, when it happens. I don't want another wife, but by-and-bye I must ally myself with other families, and may have to tjake one or more wives ; but it will be years and years, for although strong and winning re- nown as a fighter I am young. Are you ready to start again ? There is timber a few miles ahead of us, where we may find water. We have done splendidly so far. You are a perfect marvel. Cheer up and we will reach the ranges before dark, and you can have plenty of rest on the way." For some hours past ,Tirpuli had been carrying his own rug as well as the gin's, in order to relieve her of their weight, but it was quite contrary to the usual custom, and Yanara noted it with pleasure as an evidence of Tirpuli's good na- ture. The long stretch of plain was at length crossed, and with a sigh of relief the pair lay full length in a shallow pool at the entrance to the ridgy country. The girl was tem- porarily at the end of her physical resources, and required a full hour to recruit. So they lay in the cool- ing fluid until they became quite cold, when two tiny fires were lighted in the cover of thick bushes, and they each squatted over one until they were warm. This was repeated three times, then the journey was resumed until about 4 o'clock, when they clambered over some large rocks, and reached one whose over hanging summit farmed a sort of a cave, 

 With a half-choked cry Yanara fell forward on her face completely exhausted. For the last mile the man had been half dragging, half carrying her and their impediments, and although they had not reached the cave he knew of, they had gained an important point in their flight. Spreading out the rugs he placed the girl upon them, and taking two small pieces of wood from a dilly bag hurried at his best pace, two miles back on his tracks. He did not attempt to follow step by step, as it would have taken too much time, and it was not necessary. Having reached a place where the grass was long and dry with the withered leaves of a fallen box in the centre, he made a fire with his two sticks. In a few minutes flames were rising and rapidly spreading in all direc tions. "That will prevent them finding the point at which we have entered the ranges." he thought ; "but they will guess we are here somewhere, and we shall have to keep close. If it comes to the worst we can throw ourselves on the mercy of Miabbis." The slight wind helped the fire away from the ranges, but was not sufficiently strong to prevent it creeping up the rocks. As it grew in extent it would create a strong breeze, driving the flames at a great pace towards the avengers, and spreading sufficiently to prevent them ascertaining whether the fugi- tives had gone straight to the sheltering hills or had deviated from the hitherto straight line. Easily keeping in advance, the tireless young-warrior returned to his com- panion, who had recovered from her faint, and was sitting up on the rugs. Tirpuli had brought a firestick from the bush fire, and soon had a 

 wallaby which he had killed a few minutes before frizzling on the coals. Before it was half cooked he had abstracted the heart and liver, handing them to the gin. Tlie reek- ing organs, with hardly a scrunch of tho powerful jaws, disappeared down her throat. The effect was marvellous, for almost immediately her back stiffened, and her eyes brigh- tened as she watched the cooking meat. In a few minutes the wallaby, except the bones and skin, had been consumed, and Yanara was sufficiently recovered to resume the flight. The ashes were thrown down a crevice, and all trace of the fire removed. They had not carried firestlcks, as the falling ashes would have given a clue to their line of march. Their progress was now very slow for tho ruggedness of the country increased until Tirpuli had to con- tinually assist the gin, who began to wonder whether an elopement with the man of your choice was as pleasant an undertaking as it had been represented to be. At length the young warrior stopped at the entrance to a large fissure in a rock which towered fifty feet above them. "Our journey is nearly ended." he exclaimed. "Keep close to me, for we shall be in the dark pre- sently, but it will not be for long. Come on." Squeezing through the great crack, they shortly came to a hole five feet high into which they entered, the gin holding Tirpuli's hand. lt was pitch dark for almost twenty yards, when an angle was turned and it became gradually brighter until they stood in the open air. A strange scene met the astonished gaze of the gin, who had not been told what to expect. They stood, on the edge of a small crater of an extinct volcano. The space occupied some ten acres, en- closed by high walls or apparently unscalable rocks, The surface was quite level and coated with luxu- riant sweet grass, while at their feet a tiny spring bubbled in a rocky basin, and overflowing dis- appeared. There were no trees of any size, and not many bushes, the former being the emu plum, and the latter woombunye (wild orange.) A score or more of paddy- melons and wallabies rushed away startled at the advent of the in- truders and hid in the first avail- able cover. "There is our food supply for some time to como," remarked Tir- puli. "and to make sure of them we'll just close the door." This was accomplished by piling rocks in the narrow entrance, when it was impossible for the ground game to leave the crater. With brain benumbed with fati- gue and anxiety the gin followed him a short distance to where a gunyah had been built close to the rock wall, and sinking on her rug immediately fell asleep. Tirpuli's first action was to light a small fire at the foot of the cliff where some bushes grew out- wards sufficiently to disperse the smoke arising from the few dry sticks. He then directed his atten- tion to the wallabies, quickly secur- ing two with his nullas. When the gin awoke the sun was setting and Tirpuli, sitting near the fire, offered her the tempting hind leg of a fat wallaby. * We will now leave the fugitive lovers to the seclusion of their unique hiding place, which had been discovered by Tirpuli a few weeks before when following a wounded wallaby, and was not known to any other member of the tribe. Karingara was much enraged at the defection of the men who had induced him not only to complete the purchase of his bride, but to under- take the difficult matter of finding her, and bringing Tirpuli to jus- tice ; but he was a determined man and a skilful tracker, so he made no response to their fare- wells and slightly ironical good wishes, and set himself resolutely to follow the tracks. Several hours passed, and he had made so little headway that any- one possessed of less determination would have abandoned the pursuit. This alternative did present itself and received some consideration, but the memory of the way in which he had been cheated recurred and with a savage oath he sprang forward on the line the tracks had indicated, trusting to find a clue later on. ' A tiny piece of feather caught his eye, when a closer scrutiny shewed it had formed part of a slipper, and with a grin of satis- faction he marked the nearest tree and retraced his steps to where the last tracks had been seen. He then took a straight line between the two points, and pursued a course extended from those points, always sighting another tree or bush on ahead. At nightfall he marked two bushes on the same line so that he should not diverge from the course in the morning. (To be continued.) s s �^ mm� �
