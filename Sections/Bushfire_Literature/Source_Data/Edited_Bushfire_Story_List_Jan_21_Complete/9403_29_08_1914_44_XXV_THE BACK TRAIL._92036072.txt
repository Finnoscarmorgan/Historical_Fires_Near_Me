 THE INTRIGUER&S BY IHAROLD BINDIO.o a~uthor of "The Impostor," "HAawtrey's leputy," "The Pioneer," &e. [COPYRIIIT.3 CHAIPTER. XXV.-THE BACK TRAIL. Blake and his friends spent three weeks It the Hudson's Bay post, and throughout the firet fortnight an icy wind hurled the snow against the quivering building. It was dangerous to venture as far as a neigh lboring bluff where fuel had been cut, and one eveninug Benson and the agent, who were hauling cordwood home, narrowly e?eapd from death in the suddenly hsh ening shtorm. None of the half-breeds could yeaeh the factory, and Robertson confessed to soime a?iety about themi there was little t?at could be done, and they spent the dreary days lounging about the red-hot stove, and listening tco the roar of the gale. In the long evenings Raobertson told them griinm ?.riea of the North. Then there catne a week of still, clear weather, with intense frost. and when seve ral of the trappers arrived Robertson sug gested that his guests had better accom pany a man who was going some distance *outh with a dog team. He could, however, only spare them a scanty supply of food, and they knew that a long forced march lay before them when they had left their gutide. Day was breaking when the dogs were harneused to ithe sledge, and Harding and his comnpanions, shivering in the furs, felt a strong reluctance to leave the factory. It weeas a rude place, and very lonely, but they had enjoyed warmth and food there, and their physical nature shrank from the toil and bitter cold. None of them wished to linger in the North, and Hard ing least of all, but it was daunting to conotecipiate the distance that lay between them and the settlements. Strong effort and stern endurance would bhe required of them :before they rested beside a hearth again. - There wa.as no wind; the smoke went straight up, and then, spreading out, hung above the roof in a motionless cloud; the snow had a strange ghostly glimmer in the creeping 'light, and the cold bit to the bone'. It was with a pang they bade their host farewell, and followed the half-breed, who ran down- the slope from the door after his team. Robertson was going back to sit, warm and well fed, by his stove, but they could not teoll what hardships awaited them. - Their depression, however, vanished af ter a time. The snowv was good for trai ve&ling, the dogs trotted fast, and the half breed grunted approval of their speed as he pointed to landmarks that piroved it ch ,en they stopped at noon. After that tLh.y :held on until dark, and made camp asmonug a few ju:nupcrs in the shelter of a rock. AMI had gone well the first day, Barding's leg no longer troubled him, and there was cohnfort in travelling light with their packs upon the sledge. The journey tiah t'o look lass formidable, and gather ing close round the fire they ate their sup per cheerfuily while the doge fought over ?rrape of frozen fish. Harding, however, had sounic misgivings acout their ability to kreep the pace up; he thought that in a day or two it would tell on the i'lite men. Nothing disturbed their sleep, which was sound. for the cold lhes less effect on the man who is fresh and properly fed. Break fast wa. quickly despatdhed, and after a short struggle with the dogs they set out again. It was another good day, and they travelled fast, over a rolling tableland on whirh the snow smoothed out the in eqtpli.ties among the rocks. Bright sun shine streamed doe-n on them, the sledge ran easily ii?, t.he slopes and down the- hol lows, and looking back when they nooned Harding noticed the straightness of their cour-e. Picked out An delicate saades of blue again.t the unbroken white surface surrounding it, tihe sledge trail ran back with scar-ely a waver to the crest of a 5-ise 'two miles a-,ay. This was not how they .had journeyed north, with the icy wind ir their 'accr, laboriously struggling round broken ridges and thrimrugh tangled woods. Harding was a sanguine man, but 

 experience warned him to prepare for much less favorable conditions. It was not often the wilderness showed a smiling face. Still, the fino weather held, and they were deep in the timber when they parted from their guide on a frozen stream which he must follow while they pushed bsouth across a rugged country. He was not a companionable person, and spoke only a few words of barbarous French, but they were sorry to see the last of him when he left them with a friendly farewell. He had brought them speeddily a long distance on their way, but they must now trust to. the compass and their own resources, while the loads they strapped on were unploa santly teav'y. Before this task was finrsed dogs and driver had vanished up the white riband of the stream, and they felt lonely as they stood in the bottom of the gorge with steep rocks and dark pines hemming them in. Blake glanced at the high Ibaunk with a. rueful smdile. "There are advantages in having a good g'uide, and we hadn't to face a chlimb hlke that all the way," he said. "Anyaow, we .had. better get up." It co3t them somne labor an,d, after reach ing the summit, they stopped to.look for the easiest road. Ahead, as far as they could see, sntall, raggedt panes grew amolng the rocks, and 'brenas in the uneven sur face hanted at trotnol~some ravines. "It looks rouga," said trenson "There's rather a high ridg6 yonder. It might save trouble to work round its end. '?'v.at do you think?" "W',ean I'm not sure," said Harding, "1 mean to go straight soutih." Benson gave nun a sympathetic nod. "Ohe can understand that; you have bet ter reasons for gelting back toan the rest of us, though I've no particular wish Ito loiter up here. Break the trail, Blake; due Aorta by compass? " They pliunged deeper into the broken belt, clamoe nrg down ravines, crossing frozen laises and snowy creeks. Indteed, they were thankful u-aen a strip of. level I curr?ce iraltaied water, tor the toil of get ting torouga the 'timoer was leavy. Alter two days o( travel there was a yellow sun sest, and tue snow gleamed in the lurid light with an ominious brilliance, while as tney marie tneir tire a moanig wind got up. These things presaged a cange in the wat.ter, and nthey were rather r?cetu over the evening meal. They missed the half breed and mOe snarling dogs, while it looed as if the good fortune that had so far at tended them were coming to an end. Next morning there was a low, brooding sky, and at noon snow began to falt, but t:ey kept on until evening over very rough ground and then held a council round the tire. "luhe situation requires some thoug?ht," Blake reminarked. "First of all, our W:ovi sions won't carry us through the timber be.t. Now the shortest course to the prairie, where the going will lbe easier, is due south, but after we get there we'll save a long march to the. settlemenits. I'd partly counted on our killing a caribou or perhaps a moose, but so fatr we've seen no tracks." "Ti-ee must be some smaller beast.s that the Indians eat," Benson suggested. "None of us knows where to ldok for them, an1 we haven't much time to spare for htutts..." "That's so. " Harding agreed. "W'hat's your plan?" "I'm in faivor of heading south-west. It may mean an extra hundred miles, or more, but it would bring us nearer the Stony vil lage, and afterwards the logging camp on . the edue of the timber, where we might get supplies." "It's understood that the Indians are often half starved in winter," Benson ob served. "For all that, they might have had good luck. and anyhow we couldn't cross the prairie with an empty grub sack. My vote's for striking off to the west." Harding concurred, though as his leg had threatened further trouble during the last day or two, ho would have preferred the shorter route. Then Blake asked him: "What about the petroleum ? "We can't stop to look for it unless we can lay in a good stock of food, and I don't suppose we could do much prospecting with the snow upon the iround." He paused a moment with a thoughtful air. "When we 

 reachthe settlement I must go hoine, but if. the dollars can be raised, I'll be back as soon as the thaw domes to try for 'he oil. Clarke's an unusually smart man, and there's no doubt he's on the trail." "We'll raise enough money somehow," Benson told him, and Blake signified his agreement with a nod. Then they dropped into casual talk, which lasted until they went to sleep. When dawn cirne it was snowing hard, and for a week they,made poor progress with a bitter gale driving the flakes in their faces, while rations were cut down as the distance covered div steadHly les sened. Hlarding's leg was getting sore, but he did not mean to speak of this unless it was necessary. They were' how ever, approaching the neig iborhood of the Indian village, and Blake began to specu late upon the probability of their finding its inhabitants at home. He understood that the St6nies wandered about, and re alised with uneasiness that it would be singularly unfortunate if they were away on a hunting trip. At length, after laboriously climbing the rough but gently rising slope of a long divide, all one blusiering day, they camped on a high tableland, and lay awake, too cold to sleep, beside a sulky, greenwood fire. In the morning it was difficult to get upon their feet, but as the light grew clearer, the prospect they looked down upon seized their attention. The hill sum mits were wrapped in leaden cloud, but a valley opened up below. It was wider and deeper than any they had met with ince leaving the factory; the bottom looked unusually level, and it ran roughly south. They gazed at it in silence for a time; and then Hlarding said. "I've a notion thatl this is the valley where Blake fell sick, and its going' to straighten out things for us if I'm right." "That's so," Benson agreed. "We would be sure of striking the Stony vil lage, and we could afterwards foloow the low ground down to the riyer. With the muskegs frozen solid, it ought to make an easy road." Blake was conscious of keen satisfaction, but there was still a doubt. "We'll know more about it after another march," he said. No snow fell that morning, and as their packs were ominously light they made good speed across the hill benches and down a ravine, where they scrambled among ,the boulders of a frozen.e creek. ft was a grey day, without the rise in tenm perature that often accompanies cloudi ness, and the light was strangely dim. Rocks and pines melted into one another at a short; distance, and leaden haze ob scured the lower valley, Blake was, however, becoming sure it was the one they had travelled up, and, dispensing with the usual noon halt, they pushed on as fast is possible. All were anxious to set their doubts at rest, for there was now a prospect of obtaining food and shelter in a few' days, but they recognised no land marls, and with the approadh of evening the frost grew very keen. The haze drew in closer, the scattered pines they passed wailed drearily in a rising wind, and the mnen were tired, but they could see no suitable camniping place and held on, lookinmg for thicker timber. It was getting dark; uwhen a belt of trees �tretch-ed aeross the valley, and they were thiik:i"g om stopping, when lenson, who led the wy, cried out. "What is it ?" Harding asked. enison hesitatccld. "W ell," he said, "the thing doesn't seem probable, but I believe I saw a light. Anyway, it's gone." They stopped, gazing eagerly into the. gloom. A light meant that there were men not far off, and after the grim deso lation they had travelled through all were eonscious of a longing for human society. Besides, the strangers would, no doubt, have somnethming to eat, and might be cook ing d plentiful supper. There was, how over, nothing to be seen until Blake moved a few yards to one side. Then he turned to Bcnson with a cheerful laug'h. "You were right; I can see a glimmer about a mile ahead. I wonder who the fel los- are, lhouglh that's not important!" They set off as fast ae they could go, though travelling among the fallen branches :nd slanting trees was diflicult in the dark. Now and then they lost their bea con, but. the brightening glow. shone out again, and when it was visible Blake watched it with surprise. It was low, and he thought hardly large enough for a fire, besides which it had a curious irregular flicker. Drawing nearer, they dipped into a hollow where they could only distingish a faint brightness beyond the vising ground ahead, which they eagerly ascended. Reaching the summit, they saw the light plainly, but it was very small, and there were no figures outlined against it. Ben Son shouted, and all three felt a shock of disappointmnent when he got no answer. He ran as.fast as his snow shoes would let him, smashing through brush, flounder ing over snowy stones, with Blake and Harding stumbling, short of breath, be hind; and then stopped with a hoarse cry of disappointment close to the light. There I was nobody about, and the blaze sprang up mysteriously from the frozen ground. 

 "A blower of natural gas," said H~rd ing in an excited tone. "In a serise, we've had our run for nothing, bit this may be worth a good deal more than your sup per." natural gas in Canada for a thick; red moose steak, and a warm place to sleep in," Benson savagely rejoined. "Anyhow, it will help us to light our fire, and we. have a bit of whitefish and a few hard. bannooke left." Blake shared his comrade's disappoint ment. He was tired and hungry, and felt irritated by Harding's satisfaction. For all that, he chopped wood and made camp, and their frugal supper was half eaten be fore he turned to the. American. "Now," he said, "you may as well tell us what you think'.bout this gas." "First of all," Harding answered good humoredly, "it indicates that there's oil somewhere about; the two generally go together. Anyhow, if there rowere only gas, it would be worth exploiting so long as we found enough of it, but judging by the pressure there's not much here.' "What would you do with gas in this wildernesss ?" "In due time, I or somebody else would build a town. Fuel's power, and if you could get it cheap I expect you'd find minerals that would pay for working. Men with money in Montreal and New Yo rk. are looking for openings like this, and no place is too remote to build a railroad to if you can ensure freight." "You're the most sanguine man I over meit," Blake ,paid, grimning. "Take care your oaptimism doesn't. ruin you." "I wondoer," Harding continued, "who ther Clarke knows about this gas, and on the whole I think it probable. We can't oe very far from the ;tomny camp, aund there's reason to helieve he' , boeen pros pecting this di'vstrict. It's oil he's out for." "How did 'the thing get lighted?" Benson a'sed in an indifferent tone. Harding smiled as he gave him a sharp' glance. He had been 'badly disappointed in his seardh for the gum, and did not ex pect his companions to share his enthu- � aiasem over a new plan. They had, how. ever, promised to support :him, and that was enough, for he believed he might yet show them the way to prosperity. "Well," he said, "I guess I- can't blame you for not feeling very keen, but that's not the point. I can't answer what you ask, and believe our forest wardens are now and then puzzled about how bush fires get started. We have crossed big belts of burnt trees in a country where we saw no signs of Indians." "if this' blower h'as 'been burning long, the Stones must have knownmum of it." Blake remarked. "Isn't it curious that no news of it has reached the settlements ?" "I'm not sure," Harding rejoined. "They may venerate the thing, and anyway, they're smart in some respects. They know, that where the white men come their people are rounded up on reserves, and I guess they'd sooner have the whole country to themselves for trapping and fishing. Then Clarke may have persuaded them to say nothing." "It's possible." Blake said thoughtfully. "We'll push on for their campr first thing to-morrow." (To be Continued.)
