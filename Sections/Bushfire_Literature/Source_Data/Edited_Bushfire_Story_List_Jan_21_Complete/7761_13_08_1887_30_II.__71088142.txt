He asks whether any of the ladies intend to join the fishing party next day. . ' No ; it is far too hot for such a ride this weather. I hope you'll bring back a good sup ply.' They pass some cows standing knee-deep in water, others lying under the shade of the gum trees ; then on into the fields ; the voices of the reapers they hear now and then 5 a plover flies over their heads with a shrill cry 5 in a tree are two' laughing jackasses which make a deafening noise. Jack and Douglas are showing some of the girls how to reap in the next field ; others are busy raking the hay. By-and-by Carruthers notices Maud standing alone, caressing one of the dogs, and goes over to her. * Well, am I to congratulate you, Miss Maud?' She flushos anerily.

On the verandah sic Philip Thompson, and some of his guests, smoking. iThe summer wind-rustled the leaves of the trees, and gently blew the grass on the lawn. Far , away across the long stretch of plain to the left of the, homestead, i the grass was ablaze. 'How is that for our fishing to morrow?', asked Jack, i r : ' What do you mean V ' inquired Hastings;',! ' Well, I reokon if the wind chops round'to the west we shall haye pf etty hot work.' Then we'll seo what -fist you'll make at putting out a bush fire, Hastings.' A week had passed"since the fishing excursion. Jack bfbughtbáók with" him some new arrivals so th^t^Christoas Jáis; year at Merino promised to be very merry. Great preparations were going on; and they w^re, tosend for a quantity of the Christmas bush. The hay was nearly all in. That evening was to see the last waggon load. The ; day had been intensely hot, but now-at evening,'a Cool breeze had come up. Undera large gum tree they were preparing a gipsy tea. The girls had found it so warm indoors all day, that they*were delighted to get out into the.cool air. Much laughing and talking went oh. One of them declared that the tea was smoked, because Hastings had been,'attending to the firel. They tell him he had yet tolearn how to make ? quart pot' - te,a. In the,fdistance there, were the faint lowing ?'.pi ¡ cows; and the shouting ' pf the . black j'boy,v, 'a's1 he drove theih home for. milking. ;A ' "clear 'cooey ' rang , through the ;bubh,'; which Jack answered.

Amy Gordon,finding heir ' captivating powers thrown away upon Carruthers; tried what effect they wpùld have upon Ted, as she. poured his tea oüfc, and handed it to him". Maud fanned herself with her large hat,' and smiled as. she watched them, knowing how "useless. it was, though she. could .not helpwishing the young fellow would take a fancy to some nice girl. Jack was lying on the soft gráss, talking in a low tone. Maud, looking rpundf saw'them^ll merry and in pairs.' She was the.'only bné-^shé thought-left out in the'cold.

" Ithihk you have at last found yours, and lost i^too.,,Am I right, Maud? . I shall wait for my answer at the old gate to-night,' he said, as Jack calls put to them to hasten. The waggon was just leaving the hayfield loaded. The golden harvest moon had risen above the fields as the party, returned homeward. When they reached the garden the air was fragrant with the scent of the'acacias and the magnolia. Passing through the! gate, Douglas stopped and pulled a cluster of the scarlet and purple passion flower which climbed byer it. He gave it to Maud, who'tbbk it and fastened it at her throat.

The case as hé puts it is clearly this, and may be fairly taken not to be an isolated one. . A great part of the hay and nearly ali the wheat around Goulburn and Taralga, and Crook well, was wholly or partly destroyed by the heavy rains and wet season last harvest, and the potato crop is about ali the farmers in these localities have to depend.upon.until next harvest. There are many thousands bf tons of potatos in those distriots awaiting a market. Owing to Sydney being - glutted with importations from other colonies, tho farmers are shut put from it, conséquent upon the ! high railway freights.1 In these'circumstances the Railway Department is being communicated with, arid a reduotibn bf freight on potatos from Goulburn to Sydney/is asked to extend over the next three months.
