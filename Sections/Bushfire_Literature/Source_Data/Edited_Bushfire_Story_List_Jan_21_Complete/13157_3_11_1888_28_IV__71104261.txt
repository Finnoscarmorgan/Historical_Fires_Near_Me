 CHAPTER IV; (Continued). j 

 What could he do? He must do something, and prevent tb is horrible murder from being oom� mitted. He was about to call out, had not a woman come into the room, bringing a kettle of hot water. She poured some of it into the glass. He saw it all at once now. Perhaps this woman was aiding him in tbis fearful crime ; and beads of perspiration came upon his forehead as he re cognised that she was the daughter of Mr. Car ruthers. He was about to dash through the door, and seize the murderer by the throat, when the 

 woman said : 

 'Frank, come outside for a moment and look at the big bush fire. I think we ought to raise the men, because it is very near the sheds.' , 

 ' Oh,' he said, 'it's all right. Possibly it's only the men burning: rubbish.' 

 But the girl insisted ; and at last (with a sup pressed curse) he went out with her to see it. The man, who had heard all this, saw that unless he did something at once it would be too late ; and to hesitate meant death. lu the twinkling of an eye he was in the room. Snatching up the glass, he poured its contents into a bottle close at hand, and put it in his pocket. Then, as quickly pouring some whisky into the glass, he added hot water, and then dashed from the room, just as the 

 others came in. 

 Then he took his place at the window ; and every nerve strained to catch what might be said. 

 ' Well,' said Frank, 'I was right after all. It was only rubbish burning. But what with the illumination, no wonder it caused you to think it a large fire. 

 J ust then a voice called out : 

 ' Enid, I don't know how long you are going to ; keep me waiting. Do make haBte.' ' 

 She replied, ' All right, father. I am ooming now;' and, taking up the ({lass, she bade Frank good night, and hurried off to her father's room.1 On entering it she said, ' Drink this}' and Bhe held tho glass to his lips. He drank ; and then kissing him, she left the room, little thinking what an awful catastrophe had been averted. 

 But let us return to Frank, who, after Enid had left, chuckled over his success, and, taking up hia hat, walked outaide. After strolling about for an hour he came toward the house, and, putting his hand to his pocket, drew forth a letter. Creeping up to a window, he quietly opened it a little, and threw something in, and then walked away to hi� but, which was about a quarter of a mile from the house. On arriving there he went inaide, and an hour later wa8 sleep ing soundly, little dreaming how completely his wicked plans had been frustrated; nor did he know that all his movements that evening had been watohed, and that he had even been followed to his own door.
