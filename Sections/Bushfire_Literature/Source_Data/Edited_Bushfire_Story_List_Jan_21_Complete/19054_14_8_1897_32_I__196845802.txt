 CHAPTER I. 

 'Cooeyl" . The man who called was standing beneath a very large bibhel tree. A bush fire was burning within 12 yardB of -him. He kept repeating tho cooey at very short intervals, and one might almost have guessed the 

 state of excitement in which he was by; the note of urgency that marked each call. ' The horse he held by the bridle was frightened and restive. At his feet lay a man who was 'dead. The dead man lay on his back at the foot of the tree, with one arm by his side and the other extended on the grass. He had lost his hat. He wore boots and leggings and yellow cord riding trousers. ' There was nothing remarkable about these. What did seem strange, however, was that his Cri mean shirt whs out of the waistband of his trousersj and was drawn up so far on one ' Bide that a portion of his. eliest was exposed to view. His face was blackened with smoke, as if he had been working at the fire. Such was the group under the bibbcl, oh a boiling hot day lit the. end of February, ISO-1. The bush fire had been burning for hours; every blade of vegetation on hun dreds of acres of country had been " con sumed, and the sky was dark with the smoke. That it had not yet reached the dead- man's body was due to two causes � one, that the bibbel, being large, green and flourishing, took all the substance out of the ground for yards round it, so that only a scanty quantity of wire grass grew beneath it, which did not burn readily; the other, that for the last half hour the wind had been chopping about, one minute driving the fire onward, and the next blowing the smoke hack across the black expanse of burnt country. "Coooy!" the man called again. "Cooey!" cdmc the answer in quick re sponse from close at hand, and a minute later two men emerged from the smoke. Of the new arrivals, one was a lmlf-caste and the other was a gentleman of about 45 years of age. The man who had been calling immedi ately said � "Have you got any water, Billy?" "Not here, Mr. Hope," the half-caste an swered. "The bag is about half a mile back. What's wrong with Master Charles?" "I am afraid he has got sunstroke. What do you think, Mr. Lessing?" Mr. Lessingj who was the gentleman who had - come up with the lial�-easte,' stooped down and looked carefully at the dead ! man. I "I cannot detect any respiratory move ment," he said at last. "I believe he is i dead. I do not wonder at it. A day like! this is enough to kill a horse. Probably he | was working there at the fire, and, finding j himself overcome with the heat, he has I staggered back to lie in the shade of the' tfee, and expired where he fell." That the half-caste, although badly scared, had all his wits about him, was proved by a remark he now made� "I don't think Master Charles got under the tree himself. Look where his heels are I resting. Don't you see these two lines made from where he lies to the edge of the fire, as if somebody had brought him here, his feet all the while dragging along the ground?" "It may he so," Mr. Hope answered, "but whoever helped him was gone when I came. He lies now as I found him. Some one else may have been here first, and may have gone for water for him; although I think it is strange that lie did not meet some of us." The lialf-enste did not continue the argu ment, but followed the heel tracks to the edge of the fire, where he picked up a myall whip handle. Returning, he said � "Here is your whip, Mr. Hope." "No, Billy, I have not got a whip to-day; I lost it somewhere yesterday." "It's yours, right enough, Mr. Hope. It's the one I carved for you. Look at the snake, with brass eyes, running round tiie handle." "I believe it is, Billy. I suppose I must have left it at Currumbede yesterday, and, perhaps, Charlie brought it, expecting to see ine at the fire. Poor fellow, one of us had better ride to the station, and tell his father .what has happened." "Mr. Summers is not at Currumbede," Mr. Leasing answered; "he and Miss Ella left this morning to' take Sliss Almyr home, nnd will not be back till to-morrow. Only the elder Miss Summers is at the station." "Very well," Hope said, "I will follow him to Almyr's. Billy had better ride in to the station, and come back with the spring cart as soon as he can, and you could stay with the body till he returns." "I would rather not, Mr. Hope," said Les sing in his smooth voice. "As you are aware, I am not a bushmen, and in cose of an emergency, say from the fire coming this way, I would not know what to do. I think, however, I coujd find my way to the station if Billy remained." "No fenr of"Billy remaining," the half-caste answered. "AH right, both of you stay, and I will call at Currumbede on my way, and send someone with a conveyance. We must not waste much time, for this hot weather the sooner he is buried the better." All Victorian rights in this story liavo been purchased by the projirletors of "Xho header." 

 So saying, Hope got on his horse, and gal loped off through the smoke. Soon after he was gone Billy remarked that he was very thirsty, and said that he would go for the water-bag. To this Mr. .Lessing objected Very strongly, declaring that both must stay with the body ot Charles Summers, till someone came from the Btation. The half-caste replied that Mr. Lessing was not his "boss," and "reckoned" lie was going. Mr. Lessing evidently thought that this was a case for diplomacy, for though he was probably stronger than the half-caste, yet Bliould the latter make a holt for it he knew he would lie unable to stop him. For some reason he did not wish to he left a moment nlone with the dead man. Yet his voice was' as smooth as ever as lie answered � "Look- here, Billy, if you like, I will go and bring the water for us; or if you don't liko that, if you will stay with me, and help me to watch that nothing happens to Mas ter Charles's body till help comes, Iwill give you five shillings." "Right; give me the five boh. The bargain was hardly concluded when Hope came galloping back to them. Ho shouted, "Nixon will he here with his van in five minutes," and gnlloped off again. Soon afterwards they heard the sound of wheels coming towards them through the smoke, and presently a covered waggon, drawn by two horses, drew, up beneath, the tree. This belonged to Nixon, the tra velling saddler, a big, dark, fat man, with a great . beard. He climbed down from his seat, and assisted Lessing and Billy to place the dead man in the waggon, among tho sides' of leather? He explained that he had been travelling along the Currumbede road, coming out from the township, when Mr. Hope galloped up to him and told him what had happened. He had piloted him round the fire, and only left lnm when he could not mistake his way. Then, without losing nny time, lie climbed again to his scat. Lea sing nnd Billy got up beside him. tuid rode till they reached the spot where their horses were tied, then, getting down, they mounted their hacks, and all went us rapidly as possible to the station. CHAPTER II. Let me begin by saying, that I, Anthony Rusden, who record the story of tho events which commenced with the strange death of Charles Summers, have personally little part in this history. Before, however, taking up the thread of the narrative, on that hot February even ing when Charles's body was brought home, it is necessary, in order that the reader may have a proper comprehension of all the facts, that I tell mueli of what hap pened during the two previous .months, and that I give a slight sketch of myself. The latter I will make as brief as pos sible, and would very willingly omit it alto gether. A man who finds himself stranded in a bush township, a failure through his own fault at 50, seldom pines to have his autobiography published. Suffice it to say that at 24 a chest complaint compelled me to leave England. I had been studying law, and after coming to Australia I completed the curriculum, and was called to the bar of New South Wales. That I had more than the average share of brains, my repu tation in the courts at that period testifies; unfortunately for myself, my wit caused my company to be in constant demand in so-, ciety, and no dinner party was considered complete where Anthony Rusden was ab- 

 sent. Do not think mc vainglorious. This is all so long ago, and everything is now so dif ferent, that I seem to be writing of anoher man. What has the brilliant young bar rister, who more than once was compli mented by a Supreme Court judge, and who was a welcome guest at Government House, in common with a drunken old lawyer, who only cares to enter the society of .the bar parior, and whose sphere of activity when sober, or only half obfuscated, is the Nande- war police court? . Let me do myself, the justice of stating that it was the intoxication of the praise ot menrthat I sought after in those days, and not the grosser intoxication of alcohol; to find myself the life and soul of a clever, con vivial company elated mc .beyond measure. Unhappily the two things went together, and alter some years the solicitors began to think that I neglected ray business and took tlicir briefs to men with less brains but moresteadiness. Even then, had I pulled myself together, I could have retrieved my fortune, tor such was the repute in which I was held that a number stood by ine to tho very last. In stead of doing bo, I availed myself of the leisure for company which wns given mc bv the loss of occupation; nnd, insidiously, all the while, the love of liquor was strengthen ing its fascination over me. Finally, in an important case, I- appeared in the court hopelessly drunk, and the long suffering patience of the last friendly lawyer gave out, and never again wns-I retained. Even now I cannot bring myself to think much on the decline nnd fall of the six months that followed. I left my chambers, and went to cheap lodgings. Then, article by article, I sold what I had kept of my furniture; next my wardrobe was trans ferred to a pawnbroker's shelves, till at last the history becomes too squalid to chronicle. When a man I knew told mo he ' had bought a schooner, and loaded her with trade for the South Sea Islands, and good naturcdly offered me a berth, I was only too glad to accompany him. Two years we sucnt among the islands, but ns I am not writing my own story I will not dwell upon them: nor will I go into details concerning the come day, go day" existence I have led since; nor waste time explaining how it is that I am now a lawyer in Nandewar. Those who know the ups and downs of colonial life will see nothing to marvel at. As it is just possible that some of you may not know Ndhdcwar, I will tell you a little 'about it. To begin with the hotels, there are three of these � one as a matter of course being called the Royal. Till lately there was also a wine shop, where one could get a glass, of colonial wine � the police, 'however, discovered that when sar- saparilla wns asked for in a confidential tone of voice, whisky wns served every time, and the licence is now withdrawn. OfGovornmentbuildings� tho only houses in the township built of brick� there are three, each on itB own plot of ground, fenc ed in witli white palings, First there is tiie post office, where, as the open circuit is in use in New Soutli Wales, nil day long, the two telegraph instruments keep uji a con tinuous clicking. Once a day a mail comes in, and once a day a mail goes out; nnd, ; 

 save during those short periods of nativity, tho officials will converse affably v ith jou for 10 minutes on the news of the ins trie t, | the height of the river, or the result of the j last cricket match, alter giving >'ou, i letters; or, for tlie< matter of that, before : doing so. On the opposite side of the street . nre the gaol, sergeant's residence ana court house. Almost any summer s day Sergeant | Quigley may be seen in a pith, hcliuet on tno verandah of the latter, trying to keep himself cool. Every time when I lime spoken to liim there, after a few general re marks, he always observes that it beats hnn what those fellows over in the post office find to do with themselves. Lnstly, there is the public school, attended by the town nnd bush children, some of the latter com ing on horseback or in buggies from tlieir homes, 5 miles awny in the forest country. Then there are n Roman Cntholic chapel and a church, used in turn by, all denomina tions. Both of these were built long before the advent of the railway, and are square, barn-like buildings, with old fashioned roofs of shingles. Now, in order that you may, picture our township, let me tell you how it grew, lo begin at the very beginning, all the country about here was open box forest. I'or a time, almost the only sign of man's presence wns the coach that, twice a week, carried passen gers .and the mail from one township , 20 miles south of here to another 40 miles north. By the side of the track formed by the coach's wheels a public house sprang up. A few years later a blacksmith set up lira shoeing forge. Then a relation of the publican opened a butcher's shop and a store, and, befriended by a large < squatter in the. neighborhood; got his place made a post office, where letters, papers, postage stamps, pain killer, jam and pickles were all gloriously mixed up together. I think it must have been the post ofiice that discovered the place to the Govern ment, Anyhow, one fine day a party of surveyors drove up andpitchcd their tents near the public house. Then, day after day, the theodolite was borne along in triumph, and lines were blazed on the trees, and cor ner pegs were driven in; and, night after night," the bar was a scene of revelry; for every man, from the apprentice to the cook, wns "knocking down" all that wns coming to him (the boss had a private bottle of his own in his tent). All too soon for the publican the work came to an end; the tents were taken down, nnd the surveying party loaded their buggy nnd drove away; but' from that day forth the square mile of forest which they had marked off into broad streets and allotments appeared in the Lands department as Nundewar town ship. 1 have told you these things, which hap pened in the early days, so that you can understand why the streets, although some of them have only a house here and there along their length, are all broad, and run in perfectly straight lines. Traces of the old forest, too, may be seen in the grey Btumps that still remain in sonic places by the side of the roadway. . If you would see the township as I see it to-day, take the hotels, Government build ings and churches which I started by de scribing, to these anil a railway station, three or four fair sized general stores, a saw mill, half a dozen houses of six rooms, and between 200 and 300 four-room nottages, all built of pine, painted white, and with shin ing corrugated iron roofs: mix all the buildings up together, and then place them along the broach white, glaring Btreets, and you will have a fair conception of what Nan dewar is like. What you will not easily con- cei ve( however, except you are an Austra lian,; is tho great heat which on a December 

 day pervades everywhere, making the very roofs shimmer in the sun. On such a day a week before Christmas, 189 � , this Btory commences. I had had din ner at, the hotel where I hoarded, and wns returning to the two rooms which served me for ofiice nnd bedroom. It was about 2 o'clock, and very, very hot. The only thing I could see in the whole length of the street wns a team of bullocks, which had brought a load of logs to the saw mill. Every single mongrel dog had found the heat too much for it, and wns lying panting in the shade, having scratched the warm surface of the ground awny to get a cool spot to stretch on. I had almost reached my office when I heard a horse's hoofs behind me, and, looking around, I saw Keith Hope. "Hullo, Anthony! I am glad I have caught you at home. I will be round in a quarter of an hour, when I leave my horse at the hotel." So saying, he turned and rode off, nnd I unlocked the door and went inside. Keith Hope was my cousin. He had been eight or nine years in Australia, and about three years ago lie had bought a small grazing property in the neighborhood. lie wns dark, of the average height, nnd about 30 years of age. Like most men of a ner vous temperament, lie had a quick, not to say sudden, way of saying nnd doing tilings, and his spirits were suhicct to great valua tions. One hour might find him as gay as a lark, mid tho next as dejected as an owl in the sunshine. Presently he returned, nnd before lie was properly inside the room lie wns saying. "I want you to come and stay with me for Christmas week. I have arranged everything. I will drive in for you the day after to-morrow. Mr. Summers lias in vited you and me to spend Christmas at Currumbede Station. We will drive over there from my place on Christmas Eve, nnd return home on Boxing day. The holi day will do you good, old man. The heat is not nearly as trying in the bush ns it is in tins blessed fryingpnn. No excuses now; I won t take a denial." "But, my denr boy, I only know Mr. Summers very slightly, and I do not know the other members of the family nt all." Oh, that's all right. You have often met Mr. SummerB nt the Royal. As for the others, there are only hiB sister, Miss Jane Summers, and she's about 45; his Bon, a very pleasant young fellow of 20; and his daughter, who is about 17." ."Now, Keith, let me talk to you seriously. Last week I hud another awful 'bust,' and I narrowly escaped a fit of the horrors. Look how my hand shakes yet when I hold it out. Now, in the name of common sense, why should you wish to burden yourself with 'my company for a week? If I went to Currum bede, wlint guarantee have you that I would not take a gloss too much and disgrace vou before your friends?" "The guarantee thnt you nre a gentleman It s no use talking like that: you nnd I are tho only members of the old family in Aus tralia. It liappcns that it is I who have the power- to give you a happy Christmas, and if ' tlie case were reversed I know you would ' do as much for me." i I sat thinking for a minute or two. It' would indeed he pleasant, after all my years of banishment, to find myself ngain among my equals; and deep down in my heart was 

 tho lonely man's longing for a little home jife. Seeing me hesitate, Keith continued, "Listen, Anthony. I will give you another reason for coining. I wish you to see Llla I Summers; she is the sweetest and dearest and best girl in tlie world." I "Are vou and she engaged? : "Ko. but I have been 111 love with her since slic was 15. She was a real child then, though an awfully pretty girl, and for a long time at fust X managed to hide my feelings, so thnt we were tlie best of friends, and she-would come and talk unreservedly to me, telling me of the little incidents of her everyday life. -Latterly, however, whether it is that my manner has shown how much I enre for her, or that she is growing into a woman, her treatment of ine has changed. She never cpmes and talks to me by herself; and it is only at intervals, getting every day rarer, that she lets herself be happy in my company, and, often, when she does, as if suddenly recol lecting something, she will grow serious, and scarcely speak a word to me for the rest of the evening." "Why don't you propose to her? Sue is 17, you said." . "yes, but those 17 years have been spent on the station. Aunt 'Jane educated her. If she were a boarding school miss, with two or three years' experience of sweet hearts and love letters, the case would be different." . ' "Why not give the lady a little cxueri- ence?" "I wisli you had seen her, Anthony. She is as, beautiful and ns pure ns a flower. Like all. good women, she is still very much, a child in her heart. For so far the love that slip, gets in her own home Bullices her. I am afraid if I offer ruiothcr love, that she will fear it, nnd I will lose her for ever." "And, presently, a more venturesome suitor will come along, nnd you will be asked to the wedding. Of course, to a cer tain extent she fears love; all women do. Love for a woman always means surrender; yet, sooner or later, every woman meets a man who teaches her thnt surrender means happiness. A girl like Ella Summers may take a little longer lo convince, so the sooner you begin the better. You have in sisted on her youth, but in the very young est girl there is much of a woman's nature; and it is a hackneyed truism that no woman ever thought worse of a man for tho fact that lie was very much in love with her. ' "General rales are very good in their way, Anthony: hut suppose they should not lit this special instance? Suppose, instead of surrendering, as you call it, Ella refuses me. nnd 1 lose her altogether? If that happened I do not know what I would do, for the bare truth is that all my happiness is bound up with her." "I am afraid you are too hardly hit, old man. to be able to use much method in your wooing. Take a fool's advice, nnd go for her bald headed, as the colonials say. lt s your best chance." "Bald headed? That reminds me of a visitor who is staying at Currumbede." . "What is lie like? "He is a man who might he any age be tween forty nnd fifty. He is about tho mid dle height and very well built. AVliat one notices, however, most about him is that his lmir is so fair that lie scarcely seems 'to liavo any eyebrows, and save for a little down ho is quite bald on tlie top of his head. Add to this that lie always seems to be wearing new clothes, and is distin- uishod bv tlie height of his collars and tlie cpth of his cuffs, and you have his photo graph." ... 

 What is lie doing out there.'". "That iq just what I want to know. All thnt anyone knows about him is Hint he met Mr. Blake, tlie owner of Currumbede, in Sydney. He told him thnt he had re cently come from England for a six months' holiday in Australin, nnd that he was. most anxious to see a little bush life. Blake had arranged to come to Currumbede for a week, and invited Mr. Lessing, as his name is, to accompany him. However, two days after they arrived, Blake got a telegram, saying thnt one of his children was down with diphtheria. He returned nt once to Sydney, apologising to Lessing for having to leave, him, Summers nt tlie same time giving him a pressing invitation to remain, nnd there lie is yet. - "Is the fair Ella tlie attraction?" "I never thought of that; hut there is something about him thnt I don't like. Most globetrotters keep, talking nineteen to tlie ozen the Whole time, cither asking endless questions, or instructing the unsophisticated natives; but this josser is listening all the time to everything anyone says, and hardly ever opens his mouth. Charlie Summers tells mc he has tried repeatedly to get him to talk about life in London, and never succeeded." "Currumbede seems to be rather an inter esting place just nt present, Keith. First, there is a youthful beauty who does not seem to know her own mind ns to what she intends to do with her lover; then there is a second attraction in the shape of a bald- headed Sphinx, with invisible eyebrows. I really think I must accept your invitation for Christmas." (To be continued.)
