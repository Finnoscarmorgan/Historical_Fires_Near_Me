 BOOK FIFTH. THE VALLEYljF THE VASSE. VIII. THE BCSH-FIBE. 

 As they were leaving the town, on the afternoon of the third day, they met a gang of wood-cutters, carrying bundles en their backs, coming in from the bush. ' Are yoa going to the Vnsso ?' asked one of the wood-cutters, who was resting 1�r f.ho ma/IqI/Ia' 

 ' Yes.' ?Well, keep to tho eastward of the Koagulup Swamp and the salt marshes. The fire is all along the other side. We've been burnt out lip the way.' They thanked him, and rode on. Pre sently, another man shouted after them. ? There's a man and woman gone on before you, and if they take the road to the right of the swamp, they'll be in danger.' They rode rapidly, striking in on a broad, straight road, which had been cleared by the convicts many years be fore. Mr. Wyville was silent and pre occupied. Once er twice Hamerton made some passing remark, but he did not hear. The atmosphere was dense with the low-lying smoke, and the heat was al most intolerable. A few miles south of Bunbury, the road cut clear across a hill. From the summit, they caught their first sight, of the fire. Mr. Wyville reined his horse, and Hamerton and the bushman followed his example. Before them stretched a vast sea of smoke, level, dense and grayish-white, unbroken, save here and there by the topmost branches of tall trees, that rose clear above the rolling cloud that covered all. below. . 'This is Bunbury race-course,' -said Mr. Wyville ; ' the light sea breeze keeps the smoke down, and rolls it away to the eastward. This fire is extensive,' ' Where is our road now ? ' said Hamerton. ?Through the smoke; the fire has not yet reached the plain. See ; it is just seizing the trees yonder as it comes from the valley.' Hamertou looked to the westward, and saw the sheeted flame, fierce red with ghastly streaks of yellow, hungrily leap ing among the tree3 in waves of terrific length. For the first time in his life he . realized the dreadful power of the ele ment. It appalled him, as if he were looking on a living and sentient de stroyer. ' ? * We must ride swiftly here,' said Mr. Wyville, beginning the descent ; ' but the plain is only three miles wide.' ' In a minute they had plunged into the tnnrky air, and with heads bent, drove their horses into a hard gallop. But the animals understood, and n3eded little pressing. With ears laid back, . as if stricken with terror, they flew. The air was not as deadly as the first breath suggested. The dense smoke was thickest overhead ; beneath was a stratum of semi-pure air. The heat was far more dangerous than the fumes. At last they reached the rising ground again, and filled their lungs with a sense of profound relief. The prospect was now changed, and for the better. The fire in their front appeared only on the right of the road. It stretched in a straight line as far as they could see, burning the tall forest with a dread ful noise, like the sea on a rocky shore, . or like the combined roar of wild beasts. The wall of flame ran parallel with the road, and about a mile distant. 'It is stopped there by a salt-marsh, said Mr. Wyville ; but that ends some miles in our front.' 'Koagulup there,' said Ngarra-jil, meaning that where the marsh ended the great swamp began. The wood-cutters had warned them to keep to the left of the swamp. ? We must surely overtake those trav ellers,' soid Mr. Wyville to Hamerton, * and before they reach the swamp1 They might take the road to the right, ond be lost. They galloped forward again, and as they rode, in the falling dusk of n:ght the fire on the right increased to a glare of terrific intensity. They felt its hot breath on their faces as if it panted a few yards sway. Suddenly, when they had ridden about two mileB, Mr. Wyville drew rein, looked fixedly into tho bush, and then dismoun ted. He walked straight to a tall tnad tree by tho roadside, and stopped at its base, as if searching for something, When he rose and came back, he had in his, hand a long rusty chain, with a lock on one end. 'You have keen sight, sir,' sasd Ham erton, astonished. 'I did not see it', he answered quietly; 'I knew it was there. I once knew a man to be chained to that free.' He tied the chain on his horse's neck, and mounted without more words. From that moment he semed to have only one thought � to overtake and warn those in front. . Half an hour later, they drew rein where the roads divided, one going to tho right, the other to tho loft of the swamp The travellers were not yot in sight, 'Which road liavo they taken?' asked Hamerton. Mgarra-jil had leaped from his horse, and was running along the road to tho left. He came back with a disappointed air and struck in on the othei road. In half a minute he stopped, and cried out some guttural word. Mr. Wyville looked at Hamerton, and there were tears in his eyes. Ho redo to him, and caught him by the arm. ?Take tho other road, with Ngarra-jil, and I will meet you at the farther end of the swamp. It is onlv twelve miles, and I know this bush thorosghly.' 

 H.imerton ansvvored only with an in- I dignant g'ancp. 'Do not delay, tny dear friend,' and - Wyville's voice wn's broken as he spoke; 'for my sake, and for those whose rights are in your hands, lo as I say. Take that road, and ride on till we meet.' 'I shall do it,' said Hamerton firmly, and striking his horse. ' Dome on. If thoro is danger, I must face it with yon.' . His horse flew wildly forward, terrified by the tremendous light of tho con flagration. Wyville soon overtook him, and they rode abreast, the faithful bush man a horse's length behind them. On their left, a quarter of a mile dis tant, stretched the gloomy Swamp, at this season a deadly slough of biack mud, with shallow pools of water. On their right, a mile off, the conflagration leaped and howled and crashed its fall ing treas, as if furious at the barrier of marsh that balked it of its prey. Th'e bush between the swamp and the fire was brighter than day, and the horsemen drove ahead in the white glare. They saw the road for miles before them. There was no one in sight. Five, seven, nine of the twelve miles of swamp were passed. Still the road ahead was clear for' miles, and still no travellers'. As they neared the end of th'e ride, a portentous change came over the aspect of the fire. ? Hertofore it had burned high among the gum-trees, its red tongues licking the upper air. There was literally a wall of fire along the farther side of the salt-marsh. Now the tree tops grow dark, while, tho flame leaped along the ground, and raced like a wild thing straight toward the swamp. ' The fire has leaped the marsh !' said Mr. Wyville. The whole air and earth seemed in stantly to swarm-with fear and horror. Flocks of parrots and smaller birds whirled screaming, striking blindly against the horsemen as they flew. With thunderous leaps, herds of kangaroo plunged across the road, and dashed into the deadly alternative of the swamp. The earth was alive with iinsect and reptile life, fleeing instinctively from the fiery death. Great snakes, with upraised heads, held their way, hissing in terror, toward the water, while timid bandicoot and wallaby leaped over their mortal enemies in the horrid panic. (To be continued.)
