 CHAPTER I. 

 - Carlotta Davis took tlie top off her egg with, a quick precision which was chanic- tijristic, and looked across the room at the man opposite.. There were small tables "set about the room near the large bow window where the sea breeze' swept in, blowing the iorig art muslin curtain's� the landlady's 

 pride� lightly to and fro against tlie back of the cretonne covored lounge which stoud under the window. There were about a dozen people gath ered together nt the boarding house breukfast, none who arrested Carlotta's ap-. prising eyes as did tlie . man opposite to, licr, who sat with his back to the sea, and tasted his coffee with appreciation. . . , Carlotla scarcely knew whether he attrac ted or repelled� strident of Human nature' -as she tried to be� but on the whole she decided that he attracted, for his was a clover, face, the reasoning powers highly developed, the eyes alert, teeth slightly . prominent, as is often the case with bright talkative men, and' Carlotta worshipped brains, perhaps because they wore not re markably apparent' in bet- own husband, wlio .was, at present, taking a run South on. one of his frequent health hunts., She had ' arrived Only the night : before by a- Into! train, at this boarding house by the sen, arid ahe was taking stock of the possibili- : ties of amusement offered by! bcr fellow boarders. She noticed with pleasure the shapely hands , possessed by the mail. oppb-. site. Another look convinced her that it was not a perfect face, for there was n hint of solf- indulgence in the full underlip, somewhat belied by the firmness of the long rounded chin; then, ho smiled, bending towards the man .beside him, and Baying, something. in a low voice, At which the other man laughed consumedly, and Car- lotta turned to the study of, a stout widow on her left, with a dimpling daughter who promised to inherit her mother's. figure sooner or later. Outside, 011 the. long grassed lawn the sun lay in gilded shafts and 'theyo was a, lace of green leaf against the blue of summer skies, and beyond the grey paling fence tlie white crested waves looked like sheep fresh from the wash pool, feeding out over a sky blue plain, and .on - far off- beaches, flanked by dark green mangrove trees which glis- tcned in tlie sunshine, the breakers, thun dered and tossed white spume above the rocks. Carlotta thought of the yellow, "thirsty plains . and the . pallid line of,- ever-., lasting gum .trees about her home, and was: grateful for ber respite. Of course, it was better for Ben, the. dry inland elimate, but. Ben suffered from an unswerving obstin acy, and would-not. believe the doctors who spoko of hereditary consumption .and shook their heads over bis coming to the. sea, Ho said all doctors were fools, arid lie ;wastcd bis substance on every faith licaler 'and medical clairvoyant, who. rose .-up. to prey upon bis person and purse. At present lie was hunting down a marvellous herbal ist, of whom he hail heard from, a passing, drover, and who inhabited, some den. in Chinatown, Sydney. The. drover had been able to let bis; cattle, fill themselves with station grass .while, be declaimed to the boss the wondrous cures, effected by, the herbalist, who never washed himself year. - in year out, and' was as dirty as a fakir vowed against clean water� so he was in no hurry, to push on to the Government; reserve, which had boon eaten bare by a mob of stores from the Barcoo. Bon Davis 

 rode iritcf the station that night full of hope, arid told his wife to pack at oncii as' they were going south by. the next coach. Carlotta twisted Iter red' mouth comi cally and packed. She was past argument- They had been married ' five years', "and Ben's liver was affected as well as 'his- lungs,, and "he ' oo'uld1' be "very unpleasant when thwarted. Beside CO|Vjbttaitied him from the bottom of libr'sotil for' his vain attempts after the health which .the gods had decreed should riot be hisl She used to point out when they had, been married' two years, arid Bqn'ri hereditary "foe had ; reared its serpent head in tlieir' Ederi, that' surely medical riien who had, studied the' subject, and had given time- and brains. to unravelling the why and. wherefore of the ills of men, knew better what Ava's good for Ben than any chance impostor. ,. But ' her husband had frowned, drawing' his dark brows together in an' ugly fashiori, and had siieercd a cruel sneer 'of her wish" for widowhood, .arid though lie had .kissed 'her fiercely, asking an unspoken pardon, half an hour afterwards, the thrust had rankled sufficiently to make Carlotta' think before she disagreed with him again. For Car lotta was at a disadvantage. - She had married Ben, partly to escape. ,a life of cnniii with a maidcn: aunt, who' had taken charge of the orphan' girl after ber parents' death, partly because she' was bo sorry for- lior ardent, handsome lover;' partly ' because she had been- ' foolishly: brought up, and knew -nothing of the -re sponsibilities of married - life ;. possibly, ' too, - because her love, of pretty clothes made her - look upon the choosing of her trousseau as a joy, and for the hundred and one other- reasons which drive warrii'-hearted, impul-: si ve girls, into the arms 'of the -first good-' looking man who seems to worship them. She was at a disadvantage because. Ben! had then been more in love than was Car-' lotta. Girl as she was, she did not under stand tlie love of man and woman .when they love with the garnered love of bygone" ages� tlie force which drives together .as the' wave drives on the rock. Speaking of politics, a clover writer has said, "Natural cohesion endures; mechani cal union� never," and truly this applies as well to marriage as to party. And Car- lotto's heart had not been irresistibly drawn to Ben's. It was just tlie old, old" trap that Nature sends for the ignorant womun, the old, old snare of-' youth and strength and the overbearing, lover.' Car lotta got her trousseau and took pleasure in it, and married Ben, and was afraid at first of the depth.of his love,' and surprised when it grew critical, and hurt when the worship, as was inevitable, died out of his blue cycR. She thought she loved him im mensely, and did not know that her love- was more than half gratified vanity at hav ing this big man at her (tot. And' then,'- to save the situation in port,' Ben fell ill, and- Carlotta gathered up her loyalty in both' hands, for her creed was now to be duty to the sick, man. And she. played, her part' as many another brave woman 'has done and Ben never knew how she felt the drag of the sick: room and the irritable fretting of the man. Tie was jealous if she noticed others he . was , unreasonable; ho was bitter and furious with Fate, the doctors and'-the nurse-but lie was" ill.- Carlotta1 snnlcd and smoothed bis .pillow arid kissed the liectio spot on his lean cheek, and use miff wont camerto - her help/ arid so tk� jogged 9n together, jealous/fitful nassion on na:side, and a quiet, helpful tolerance on rthe other, -But . Carlotta was no blood less saint, no patient Griselda at heart' She revolted fiercely at the want of sun and .mn-th in, ncr daily life, revolted that she couid not -find it possible to love him more deeply than she did, revolted at the mockery of bcr marriage, but she never' showed it to the man whoso wearing congh she heard in the short, hot nights, whore railings at fate she listened to by day, ex cept when-he- was pursuing a new quack und enthusiasm held the field pro. tern. , would His arms round Carlotta's slenderness and crush her against him with sudden strength, "I am on the right track this time, old girl," he would say exultant-' ly. We will have that trip to England "on -f , !un fit. and-the Doc tors. and Carlotta would run her long fingers through his damp hair the way he liked her to do,, and smile, till she some- times thought that mechanical curve would grow upon her lips, and never leave theni again. Occasionally Ben was token with a re ligious . fit, and dragged Carlotta from church to church, and returned utterly de pressed and lit for bed/ where he worild 

 ... i 1 1 1 ' lie a day or two in despair, a misery to himself and to' his wife. .' Then lie. woiild. arise, scud for a brandy ami soda, and take lier to the theatre for several nights in succession, and condemn, all parsons as "hypocrites, and vow thnt' this was the only life worth living for, ' nrid .that lie would client tlie undertaker for many a year. At other times he would' piny cards lfour after hour,' and quarrel with the other men in tlie house if he lost; anil . Carlotta would smooth things over in the best way 'she could, because she knew lie gambled with Death and Life, and was greedy to cram all the success lie could' .into his days, lest they should not bo long in the lund. Car lotta's baby , had died of a!fonn of tubcrcu- iosis when it was only a few, weeks, old, and she had prayed an answered pagan prayer that she should not again, be a mother. Ben had accused her of improperly: feuding tlie child, and had declared that itjliad ii splendid constitution "hut for the blessed Doctor meddling and killing it," and Car lotta had some trouble to prevent bis go-, irig to law with the township , Doctor. But so far the worst danger bad fiusscd Carlotta by. No oilier man bad made her pulses "quicken, no other, mail made ber. duty a harder one, and there were times when she was almost recklessly happy inth the bax�i�incss a child takes in air. and sum shine, flowers! and sea. This mood-wus on, licr this morning as she .sauntbred along - the little red path that curved down bv the bathing boxes to tlie strip of white beach. The black ' jetty rail out to sea bordered 'by galvanised iron bathing en closures, and' away on ' her left - She could see the outline of high hills und wooded points, " and in front '.of' -her- tlie- flashing white sand cliffs of the" prison island. About the Bhoreward end of the jettv, where a red flag flapped in the wind, were dark yellow blossomed cotton woods, and ail- along the grassy cliff grew red and. white gums, varied by the occusioual deep -toned trunk of an ironbark. There .was a quaintly built wooden kiosk where they sold harmless soft drinks, and hurmtullv hard sweets, tasteless , . sandwiches and strangely flavored "hot, water for picnick ers' tea pots," and here were hard wooden benches under tlie wide, spreading More- ton bay figs, which tempted the sojourner to pass 011 to the grassy knolls' on tlie . edge of the - cliff, where "green heads" arid "jumper" ants awaited their prey, arid gar nered , -in. the casting- .away from, many luncheon baskets. - A few bloated sparrows hopped about the kiosk tables, puffed out ;with their gleanings, and; a satin winged crow cawed hopelessly in . a glossy piune tree, -and inland .the sun glisten caught' tiie leaves of, tlie mungrove trees about the mosquito breeding 'mud flats and glinted on the iron roofs' of ' far off ' cottages backed by the heaped bhic'.of the sleeping' hiiis. ' ' ; ' Carlotta' gathered her crisp print frock .in her hand and exposed' her Bliiri ank'us ,to tho admiring gaze "of a man on the lull who was hurrying to" catch the morning train "to the city, ' and who murmured to .himself as he closed the 'front gate of - tho .boarding house wtih a' bang behind him, ,"Now 1 wonder who that girl is?" and ,then dismissed her from his thoughts aud inliajcd deep breaths' of tlie morning air, as 'Carlotta was inhaling it running down the red path towards -the -sea, feeling, an exhilaration in ! her blood, and a sudden mtercst in life. , < . "1 believe I am going to like .this place,", she said, flinging licr anus out' in greeting to the -waves, "I wonder how Ben ; is get ting on?" . 

 At that moment Ben was mounting a bus in search of the unknown god, and thinking of. the trij) he. arid Carlotta would have to England when hcjwris. strong, again! On the. wijole he was' pleased with Car lotta, though' lie was. .sometimes 'matte vaguely uneasy by a certain repetition in her cheerful loying's)eeehes,l'aicertuiu flxity iu her "encouraging smile."' ' For truly if Love,, cannot ! lie hid, it''llies. a, ' cleyer wbmqn -to. hide indifferencrijundcr a cloak of love.. . jCarlotta was a cleyer woman, but Ben, in spite of all, was a.'loyer. . , . , . ! ;An ihour later when he 'bad penetrated the malodorous-, kennel -where the greasy Jew" herbalist mixed his nauseous potions with unfiltered water, had 'his hand held by an indescribable paw adorned with, per fect claws iu lieu of finger- hails, paid flis heavy fee - and put ,the stoppered bottle, full of a dark' fluid, which was, according to the Jew, the very elixir of life, into bis , coat pocket (where lie held one hand against it all the' way back to his hotel), slixiped on . some unimaginable filth in the Jew's passage, passed through a crowd' of orange arid pale yellow children of the slums, till he found a hansom ! and ' lay back exhausted on its cushibns, a sudden depression came over, him and he wanted Carlotta's fingers on his hair., But as there was no Carlotta he sent for a double .por tion of brandy, and finished up the. day at the .Tivoli,. clapped -the double critendres of the little French singer and felt a devil "of a fellow. :Thcn he went back to his hotel and choked over some of the elixir .of life, - which tasted like liquorice and water (as no doubt it was) and. expected to wake ra the morning sound in . wind and limb. Arid Gdrlotto slept with the moon light on her face arid dreamed that' a man with thoughtful "brows arid shapely hands had pulled the wedding ring from her. long finger and thrown it out into tlie sea,' where it flashed . and fell arid disappeared iuto . the , moon-tipped wonder of , the 'waves.'., ,". : And out , on .the lawn where the wide shade, trees, sighed together; and a shrill cricket chirped- in the seeding grasses on- the overgrown tennis, court, a man walked alone, looking, at - the stars. He liked -to look at tlie ' stars, this man ; >vho formed many theories, some -feasible,, some wildly impracticable, about the universe. It seetn-. 'ed to. him as he gazed at those far points of light which he knew to be worlds .other than the- world on which he - paced that his soul communed with the Architect of tho Universe who .sits! alone on white untrod heights planniug the. final evolution . of man . to perfec tion. As. -the. flower was., ..first a green leaf , ere. it burst, into ' gojdcn bloom, to be .kissed by the first rare pat-, terricd winged butterfly Nature made to fulfil the task of proiMi gating the flowers which were hero before man was, .as each lower form of. life slowly becomes a higher to meet the demand of the hour, so surely, does man . evolver from, stagnant thing .to- active animal and thus, Through . bloody, suffering und cruel pangs and mighty throes of birth, comes .the mind fit for God's rays to pierce, fit for; God's rays to dwell in. Often we fail, often we are thrown back, arid. the boast and the stagnant thing which rolled lazily on its side in the mud and' thought it had travelled far, come upper most, but it- is only, to brush' the dust Irom our knees, "laugh at a fall, get up and be gin again." ' This man knew all about the1 falling arid the getting up again, but he held on to his ray and comiriuned with the' stars." Somehow he felt the need of the1 stars, to-night. A scent of flowers from the little' garden in the front of the house came to him; Tho' perfume of unseen mignonette arid late' roses, and then from among the seeding grasses there rose a cloud of hungry, buzzing mosquitoes, and he fled hastily to wards tho bachelors' quarters, and said good night to the stars For above every thing in the world this man hated mosqui toes'. "Let me advise you," said the stout widow to Carlotta on the following day, drawing a squatter chair out beside where Carlotta sat under the verandah, the daily paper on her- lap, her eyes ou the sea and a sense of blessed idleness pervading her Heing, "Let me advise you as to whom to mix with in the house. It is such a pitv Miss Carlyle has to take everybody; bIic must make the place pay, you' know." Carlotta said drowsily that she supposed so, and wondered vaguely how" many chins the. widow possessed; she felt' too lazy to count. "Did you notice a red headed person . in1 the corner hear the door, we call that 'the 

 pit' you, know � it's where Miss Carlyle )iuts- tlie- peoiile who urc not - 'quite' ---you understand? She is fast � really � not at all nice," dropping her voice to a confidential whisper� the lrall murk of the scandal gatherer all; the world over. "lIuBbarid in the buck blocks, you know � red hair� you know the .sort of person� sits on the .veran dah with young' men';, they simply enn't'get away, .from., licr! " "Perhaps, they don't want to !" said Car lotta quickly, a little resentment in her eye; she did not care for this stamp of'coufi- doneo. The .-stout widow laughed; the thin luugh of tho evil iriiudcd, which' tells bo much. "Poor fellows ! Anyone can see 'they would rather be with the girls ! I wish you could hcai my, Muttic play, Airs. Davis; .but unfortunately licr violin is- in town be ing repaired� 'laid up for alterations and repairs,' Mattic calls it� she -is so witty ! Did you': notice her little passage of arins with Air. Borlaiso. this morning at break fast ? Ho .ulways likes to got the sole � fish, you know � and he asked the waitress if there was only one sole this morning among. the other fish, would she bring a pack of cords, and let him cut for it. with the other men. Alattic said, 'Don't imperil your immortal soul, Air. Borluise.l' Wasn't that just too smart 1 Soul� s-o-l-o� you know 1" . . Carlotta 'said she knew, and found the wit quite -- overpowering. "Wliieh- is Mr. Borlaiso ?" she asked without curiosity. "The fair man who laughs so.- much at the table -by the window� such a queer fel low! But he and Ahit. are. great friends, lie admires licr immensely. AlaCtie is so intelleetuul, you know; she talks -to him about: the., moon." "How.: nice !" Carlotta was looking out to sua, whore a tliin trail of smoke showed tho 111Q1I boat between sculiiic uud sky. She was wondering what sort of. people were on that - boat starting on . the long voyage� people with like feelings to her own, perhaps, who would see Colombo; golden -Ceylou, Aden, yiicz- � all the places she had read about and longed� yet never hoped� to sue,' in spite of Bun's Faith 1-J'oalers. - "Yes ! Mattiu goes in for intellect� you see, she can't help it," said Alattic's mother' vaguely, spoculating-as to liow much a year ALrs. Davis's husband had, and whether -she. riiudo her own frocks, for xicopie's virtues wore measured' by i their iucoines, according to Mat tie's mother. "I am sure she can't," answered Carlotta, waking up and striving to he polite. "Intel lectual people can't help being intellectual," she added lamely, and then laughed - do1 Hciously, like a naughty schoolgirl. But Airs.' Snyers � Alattic's admiring mothrir � did riot see anything funny in the speech, and -ineti tally docketed her as somewhat hysterical, but worth cultivating, as . -the bouse- maid had reported her possessing ivory 'backed hair brushes with gold riioriiJ- grams. Everybody hasn't that. Possibly her husband whs a rich squatter. It might mean cosy luncheons in town, or , an occa sional boating . picnic- for Mattic and oppor tunities ill tlie moonlight, as, of course, the red-heuded grass widow would not be in vited. Airs. Duvis would be guided by her, she wus so young. Yes, even in the '.morn ing light she wus not wrinkled round the eyes like Aluttie unfortunately was, though thisfe was something strained about her mouth. , Alra/ Sayers was not able to de cipher the signs. of soul-conflict.. She bad never' suffered - it herself. Expediency al ways won the day with Alts. Sayers; "I only intended staying a week when I came," said Mrs. Sayers, pulling her needle 

 through the - cunvas she was embroidering with pink suriflowcrs, stiff and tortured looking. "Brit, you see, I thought it only right to consider Alattie, so decided to . re main for the summer. . . Air. Brown, the man sitting next to Borlaiso� rather bald, with white beard � you noticed him, I nm sure� ho. is so distingue � he admires Muttic so much � r" "Isn't ho -rather old- for; her?" asked Car- lotty, simulating interest in Alattie's ; con; quests. . - "Aly dear! lie is a bachelor, with' �20,1)00!" ; ' Airs.' Sayers.;stabbed the heart of a -sun flower with savage 'precision) and Carlotta seemed to see the old bachelor leading Alat tie ' with- her' wit -and her .dimples, to the altar,- while the stout widow watched the chureh door! lest tlierc should be any fal tering on the bridegroom's part. "But what about Air. Borlaise?" she said. "Does not your daughter-�" Airs. Sayers shook her head.' "I do not; think Borlaiso is- a riiarrying , sort,", siie said, "He is always talking about Science, and has quite dread ful ideas about God. He never goes to church� lie says ho! is afraid of rising up and hitting the clergyman for taking him for . a- fool! My. late, husband was a Alcthodist � � " That was conclusive; Carlotta nodded and wished she had takcn.'a book under tlie trees on . the lawn, where delightful flecks of light . and - shade danced elfin polkas. During the greater part of her life she had found books more congenial than people. Books ohii can put down when they grow wearisome; the majority of people refuse to be taken ujj and dropped , when they bore. Books can't answer back,- and one can shut them' up if they annoy. Once when, a child slio had thrown a book that failed to please her from the top- of a mul berry tree, into whose- branches' she had climbed to read,- to the ground. It was a Library book, and she had broken its, back, and her mother had scolded her. She. would like to do the same by people she 'met sometimes � there was so much satis-, faction in ' flinging tho disagreeable from one while one swung in tree tops of imag-'. iriirig. ' ' ! "Then- there is that married couple who sit - 011 the other side of you; ' xnosperous looking, trade, you know. I speak' to them sometimes in the house, because it is right to be agreeable, " . said Mra. Sayers, continuing her persistent inventory. "But; - of course, should not recognise them in 'the street. Alattic borrows patterns from her � ' the woman is good natured, and tries to keep her place, and, of course, we do not- want to drive any of Aliss Carlylc's board-' era aWay. We are so fond of the dear thing, though. I do . believe� between our selves�that it, would be better if she, kept in the background and did not mix with - the boarders so much. You see, although she is a clerjgyinan's daughter, it is uot, quite the thing. She should remember that we pay her for board and lodging,, but she is so touchy that one cari't say ' anything. People in that position! should riot be. proud." .... ., There was a chastened virtue about Mrs. Saycrs's shake of the head as she broke the point-of her embroidery needle against a flaw iu the canvas, which wa's irresistible. Carlotta laughed again. - "Poor Aliss Carlyle!" Bhe said. "Indeed, Bhe is doing very well," an swered the stout lady hastily. "We pay thirty shillings a week, arid the trades people I spoke of� the Hawgoods � pay. more, I think, and the house has been full all the summer. She does very well, In deed, out of it, and I am thinking of ask ing hor to make a reduction for us, as Ave are almost permanent� and may stay alto-! gether." Carlotta understood that this was depen dent on whether Alattie's dimples captured the twenty thousand pounds.- "I have totted up what she pnyB the ser vants," contiucd Afrs. Sayers, "and about what the food costs her, and the rent, and I 'find she has a clear profit of nearly two pounds a week. Out of that she only has to keep, her widowed sister's child and pay into a life insurance policy (she- has in sured herself in favor of the child), so I think as that is all,, beyond her personal expenses, she does very well out of us in deed. I must not forget to speak to her about that reduction." . "But in the winter� there can't be much profit � with tho house to -keep up." Mrs. Sayers frowned a little at Carlotta's moment of illumination. "You young wives never understand finance," she said, and,- smiling, put tlie- question by. : .. , .- Then the approach of Mattie enabled 

 Carlotta to snatch at the longed for oppor tunity of escape into - the- rool . green shadows of the lawn. There sl.e sat for a time undisturbed, rocking to and fro in the eruzy wooden seated rocking chair, which stood under the tree near the white paint ed wicket gate� a' chair which tlie young men were alwuys forgetting to bring in at night, and which hud grown weather beaten and devoid of varnish under tlie, droppings of many heavy dews and the washings of sudden land blown showers, and the blaze of morning suns. Across the lnwn, which did duty us .both tennis court and croquet lawn on occasion, when the knock about hoy was sent out with a pair of shears to trim the rank grasses, stood the .bachelors' quarters . belonging to tlie house. . Near the. ayoodeu steps descending from the verandah a monthly . rose wns in bloom, arid Carlotta admired the soft pinki- ness of the flowers with, a wish to possess� a. wish she always experienced when seeing roses, a matter on which she candidly told . her friends she had no conscience, for she would steal flowers anywhere and .every where. . On her. ri'glit beyond the bow window of the . diningroom stood a handsome plane tree, and the little galvanised iron bath- .room, the fern house, and servants' quarters. On licr.' left was a small shed built of ti-troe polos, which had at one time, done duty as a summer house, but which at prescut held , a brood of plump yellow ducklings and a fussy step mother hen. At tlie back of the shed .was, the paddock, di-. vided by.a'tall paling fence from tlie lawn arid behind that again were cottage roofs and tall sparse leaved gum- trees. It was a pleasant spot iu which to spend an idle morning, wliilo the little Winds cariie whispering secrets' in the- ear, und the sun kissed the warm living scents out of grass and flowers with a' proiulsa of hope re newed. . "There is so much to see, so much to think about in tho .worjd," mused CurloHa, resting her chin on' her'slhu piuk palm, and looking at .the roses, "I wonder why wo bother so inucii about people! Surely with such a lovely world, such changing seasons,' tlie joys of' literature, art rind scientific re search, even the. material pleasures of eat ing and drinking the nice things tlie eartn provides; a good swim in cool green seas 011 a hot day, a seat 011 tlie white sand under .' tho shade of a ridge rooted fig tree, the perfumes and the colors of tho flowers; comfortably cushioned arm chairs anil a -blazing wood fire in the July evenings; a quick drive- behind glossy .coated horses and the hammer of their hoofs on, the sandy road; -the swinging creepers in. the- heart of .inland scrubs; the '.'mauve convolvuli climbing over -the brown rocks; tho call of hell birds in tlie foresteountry; the whirr of black ducks' wings in the swamp;' the big blue water lilies on the lagoons; the fisliing crane, feather white along. the creeks; the drifting to .and. fro -in boats with the rip ples singing against tho keel; the red sun sets on the ranges; the opul lights of dawn on .Tlie grout grass plains; the mist of white cloud along , tho purple storm wet hills; surely this -should be enough to satisfy women, without men's love; which is -always a pain; which is, I should think; -mostly a disappointment; personally I aili sure I cotild'livc without it," and she put the middle finger of her loft hand thought! ' 'fully -into tlie dimple in her little white chin,- Winch, had she known it, so belied her words; for it. was the most loving litLle chin in the world, and made for a man's kissing. 

 As she resisted a pressing inclination to get up and pick tlie pink roses that nodded beside the wooden steps, one. 'of the parlor maids came over the grass frpm the house, bringing a telegram from Ben announcing that his herbalist insisted upon his staying in Sydney a month longer to complete his cure. "I already feel better," wired hopeful Ben. /' Carlotta folded- the telegram and stuck it iu her belt, within laugh that held a tinge of bitterness. "Poor old Ben, laying- up .another Vtlisappoiritiriejit for ; himself;"-' ihe said. "Oh, well,'.' with a little yawn, "1 daresay- I shall be able to put in time pleasantly enough' here. I will do some lace work and write any amount of letters, and go in for health cures arid; sea. bathing � not to mention the .pleasure I shall derive from watching Alattie's conquests. I really am glad Bon considered tho question of expense in talcing me with him. T believe I should have got out of patiorico with -the herbalist and suggested Ben spending' .the money on huts instead ! Sometimes I think - I am not so patient as I w(as some months back, and that there will be a breaking out some day which will astonish Ben as' much as invself !" Then she closed her eyes and drifted'into a delightful dream of a world of intellect and beauty � quite without' men ! And the' little winds tliat read her thoughts went away laughing. , CHAPTER H. -. The - other chair, a't the table laid for two, where Carlotta' sat, wus" occupied by a sturdy hazel eyed young fellow, who greeted her with a friendly smile when she came out to breakfast a day or two later. "You are Mrs. Ben Davis?" he said., "I knew jrour husband some years ago." "Oh! did you? How do you do? He is in Syd ney now, you know." ... ' "So Miss Carlyle told me. Aly name is Tom Carcwe. Don't suppose he has over .mentioned me to you� my friends usunlly don't- mention me to. their wives! Tom Carowe stands, for nothing much good out Winton way!" Carlotta laughed. "I don't suppose one can believe all you say of. yourself. ' : Young men from the West often imagine themselves 'Worse than they are. T .'hriye heard .your' name; though� surely Lsaw; it iri the papcra'puce?" "Not police- court, I hope?. No; it was in connection with my jolly old. biirning, L.'. expect � the other fel- low lost,, ari ear, you k'ndw; so I. came off -pretty well,"- holding out . his ' scarred hands, on which the fresh skin was purpling. "Three months' spell I got, and rim just takirig out' the leavings of it here� went to New ' England, but racketed roririd too much there, too many old friends wanting to shout � 'so Doctor said go to some old maid, prim Tittle sea side place, just- like tills." -. , ,"Yes.

Then in came the matron and called the black boy, and they got him off between them and killed him under a typhoid patient's bed. The deadliest snakes- out West are the brown � black are nothing to 'em. I have never known a case of recovery from the bite of- a brown snake out there.

He leaned forward, getting into his favor ite argumentative attitude, but Carcwe re fused to' be drawn, saying that he consider ed his breakfast of more importance tliau anything else' at present. "Talking of snakes," said a quiet little woman from the Gulf, who shared a table with two' bright-eyed children/' "At a place near Warwick, an overseer 011 the -station- used to notice that his little (laughter took her porridge out every morn ing to a certain heap of stones at the bot tom of the garden.

The snake slipped regularly from, the rocks at the same hour every morning to look out for his breakfast. The child was so upset' when they lulled her pet." "So was Eve � I'll bet," said Carcwe; "women love to be tempted. Nothing the dear tilings enjoy like a spice of dunger." Aire; Sayers looked shocked.

"I haven't quite got over the burning yet," he said tragically, seating himself in the' stern beside Carlotta, and wiping his forehead with his handkerchief, "Now) if everybody was as light as you, Aire.
