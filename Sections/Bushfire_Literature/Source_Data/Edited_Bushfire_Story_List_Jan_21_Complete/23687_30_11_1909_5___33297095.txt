A CHASE IN THE BUSH: A TALE OF THREE CHRISTMASES. By Elgin Grey. "The greatest attribute of Heaven is Mercy; And 'tis the crown of. Justice, and the glory, Where it may kill with right to save with pity." A wide road, bounded by seemingly endless, rough stone fences, stretched. in a sinuous line across the level plain; Eastward, whence the road led, lay the: city, its position marked to the eye only by: the dull cumulus of smoke and dust' which. stood- against the skt. T - the south stretched' a long black .htbrizon line, broken 'here and there by faintly seen trailling . vaporous . banners . which told where steamers came and went. , "Westward, the plain merged ,itself in dark - undulations of bush, with nearer outposts in -clearly de-. fined shapes of trees, that rose clear against the background of -an orange skr.: From behind -the bushland - there ran ,ou..t to the tight a, distant blue range, which' s ung round ?in a ' ?crcent ,xind -.shut 'in all the north.. Under the hither . ide' of the- ele ulhaitinie r.domes which at intervals broke the gejieral level of the momn tain, wall, the ev"ening light died away to inky 'shadwas where night had already come. It was ta Australian evening in I summer- -early summer in a year of ample - rainfal, and . luxuriant growth of lierbawe. which -had 'not-: -et taken-on" the ffill t?vwny tints of the hot season;. The sun was lost behind the mountains, :and the pale sickle of'. few' 'davs' moon floated on the edge of the Western orange ; light. . On the roar' and. 'heading westward only'one' moving obiect brcke the sol 'jtilde of the level view. A heav . dray drawn by -a team - of slot-plodding : buhlocks rumbled dully .alpnue, :l, - iris behind it a fume of yellow :dust which hun.' low any` lazily in the air, slowly snreadine and -thinnmng itself to a .mere haze in the rearward distance. - Hero and there a ?elated-' bronze ggshawk 'hovered -"on. silent wing along thi stone fences, and inag-. pies .in. threesf and fours gathered for flight-. t their roost�in places "n the bushland .ahead, . their melan- choly evening nottes and the vibrant whirrinre of mole crickets .according well with the- solitude of,the. scene. As-the bullock-dray- rumbled on ward one..iight at first-have supuos edl it without a driver. -.A nearer 'view,, hof'ever, showed stretched ,lazily on ,his stomach upon ta.rau lins and empty sacks, a 'lank-limbed youth in .a coloured _crimeani shir: and dusty .moleskin: trousers, ";s baettered and shapeless felt hat on the back of his head, and a 'newspa ner held close-po his freekled f:'c." -that. he might continue his reading of.:some absorbin subjeet while the last ray of davlight lasted. ".N w and itheii,' w-thout lifting his eyes from his paner,.fht swore raucously and decisively at one or oth ir(of his b6asts, stimula.ti.g them. to non.,n' :"i-t r increase; of 'ace with creaking of bows :nd.yokes. ijngle of chains, and .'1iider. rurble of weels - A t Ilength when the last hawk had ceased to .hunf, and the. last ma.gpme foirsakezi the glooming .plain, he folded the nerspaper, jtossed- it aside, and sprang .from. :his dray, whip in hand. Rand;ug along his team he laid the lash with loud cracks across the backs of his more s!uggish animals: then; lighting a nipe, he taalkd to himself on what. he had read. '"Can't imagine wha.t bloktes see in it," he said; "not blokes.?M'ith ?ny - other chance anywavy. They're al ways nabbed ?at last--or shot ,own like a dingo,? :'and. the shooting's best after all.

 team the creacent moon dropped lower and hid itself behiiid the wall -of bush ahead. The stone fences of the roaldside gave place to wire fences, the posts alone of which were dimly visible standing like sentinels along the track. A wood'- duck flying overhead uttered its long cat like call, and the driver started in voluntarily. "Yah," he muttered conttemptuously, as he recovered himself, "I'm all -on springs over that bushranger chap! I don't like the night just now somehow. Give me the day' any time, with the sun-! lig1ft. and swallows, and magpies, "and everything bright and happy away to the sky line." As his team drew near the deeper darkness where the bush bordered the wayside the road dipped slightly from the level 'of the open ulain. "Whoa!" sa:d the dr;ver,'"spell Th, bullies !" and standing beside .the near "poler" he leaned against the beast's massive shoulder, .and ab-; sently ca.rissed its curly - haired neck.- Looking away across. the onen. paddocks he restid- thus for some minutes, whenii from the dim northern boundary of the plain . a -no&nt of light flashed redly on the marvin of the. forest._ " Someone 'possum-shooting,'-' said .the youth, anl turned his -ear for the; report, which "after thlee or fo'ur scondr came down to" him dullcld by the'dis tace.: As his ear caught it a,'dou= -ble' flash. followed byr' a s inale one, aeain brkk'" the. -darkness, 'and .their. reports still-punctualed the stillness.� "That isn't 'possum-shooters;" sqid the youth': "those were rifle shots. Wonder what's uP . . -! 1A a.in flushes andl reports cut thae calm of the night.. and, ' drop'ing with his ear to the enrth, thelad lie 'ten-'d long and intently. . ' "Horses galloping, all right;" he ! mutFered. - "Could - scarcely 'be-. that chan' on this side.' Might ' be. r tl'ough, with hard riding. God help .lrim anyhow !" i Cracking.his whip loudly he urged his 'team into the. blackness of the bolt of bush 'which bordered the w'nding �descent to the flat-lands where lay- home and rest for driver and animals. . More than two miles of bush had to by nassed through, and 'ho was, .:somehow, strangely ani ous to get done 'with this 'particular part of 'is- familiar road.. -The- cries . of onossums and" native bears, which' came :occasionally from aloft in- the rel-lgums. sounded to him -like por -tents of trouble. The rattling iaf. loose streamers' of' dry bhark-, over .which Jhe -harmless nocturnal. ani mals ' scamp'ered in - their traffic ' among 'the boughs,' waas an eerie sound to 'him. Along -the under-. Sgrowth :on the hillside sounded -the disinal', sextuple; note, of- the night-' frog. -I From an old quarry ahead 'came -.the 'long .swislh and bicker 6 of ?.uarrelling tiger-cats. The I~d dknew well. enough- the source of every sound.. A thousand times, and many thousapds, he had heard them, but. now :they sounded ominous,- and as if of another and more mystic world., "'v?e. got the creeps right enough," -he muttered, and then shouting, "Gee up, Snowy, you loafing ca-ow,'.' he. smote - 'heavily with his whisip the beast he had 'fondled a, few minutes before. - In. res -.onse to his urgings the ibullocks stepperout briskly, and-the descent becom ng-steeper, '-he steadied them with whip and brake, until, with . much grindinig and burmping, the, worst of the downward trip was ac complished. At about 'half-distance' from the valley.,beflow, the 'road ran out on a level terrace, which separated' tho s-teep declivity just descended from a more gradual slope beyond. Here. driver snd team rested for a few' minutes. The youth's m'nd, free from the need to attend closely to, the difficulties of the descent, turned. againot' speculation regarding the ~hti~ing'rie Ifad heard-across the "I wonder if it was him,"'-he mut-. ! ired, "him, with-- thle troopers in 'base. : ight have been; perhaps making a break for town when they got on his tracks. Things are aw-! fully aouiet just nowm, anyhow. Per haps they got him." SWalking- -ahead to the edge 'f the terrace lhe peered down the second descent to" see that 'all was clear,' and, having heard or seen nothing, returned to his bullocks. He had! just cracked his whip and started his beoasts on their way when some sound caught his attention. 'NWay-ee," he cried,' and brought 'them agaiin to a standstill. From the bush on his right came the thud of the-irregular gallopinig of a"horse.I - By the crashing of undergrowth and fallen timiber, it was plainly Ibe ini urged forward by a desperate or reckde'ss rider. The lad stood inan attitude of intent, litunhia., Aifeow 

 paces from the road the noise of the horse's forward movement ceased, and. only its heavy_ breathing was to be heard. The rattle of stirrup irons and the familiar clatter of the bit on the beast's teeth showed that it was being freed from saddle and bridle. A stroke of the bridle on "its flank and its lighter gallop were as easily read by the bush-bred youth. For some reason the horse man had turned his mount loose in the bush, and desired to quit the vicinity of the road. As rapidly as the acts were performed the listener took in their intention, and, without knowing why, he called to the un seen nerson in tones of friendship. S"Hallo there! what's uple he Tasked: "this way. to the road." Stepping towards the low fence which separated the highway from the bush, be could dimly perceive someone scrambling towards him. Reaching a helping hand across the timber, he found it grasped by the stronger, and the next moment a gatnt figure-stood. beside him and lean'dh"eavily upon his shoulder. T" na mehwas a' b esid wyp shrdlu The man - was tall and heavily bearded, and was dressed in nothing but a coloured flannel shirt, and trousers tucked into knee-boots.- Hef was bare-headed, .aa his hair, which hwsn lon mand stra glina, hung over his forehead' and neck in disordered masnes. Once or twice he clutched iin his intoual as -the apparently struggled to find speech. As he seemied about to collapse on ' the ground, the youth nulaced an arm ai ut his body, and supported him to the dray. HolPini him in, be hastily spread some of the empty sacks, and as the str, ner fell prone unon them, the Ilad rfolled up two or three. more ande ? Sthrust them beneath his h-a.a by way of a pillow. As hem huriedly added Sother sacks and the tarpaulin - for. covering. his hand caine away from ry stR-ager's. clammy with -Me thig that made the lad shudder. He sa-i.l 'nothi;n, -ut .hasily completed I what us rjudgment told him must be an effactual concealmpnt. Striking I a match behindi the flap of the tar n elin, he glanced ouicklyv at his hande and asm quicklv extinguished Sthe '.iht. "You Are bleeding." he whispered, as he lifted the covering from about the man's head; "what's unit" A iren?v came. in thick - and broken words-= "'t? or 'Christ's seake,.?oung fellow Frhe Forubs -- shot -- a bit ago- shoulder-bled a, lot-stoppea now ; .vou'll not-nut me away." "No fear." replied Bob. "Lie 'low-keep aquiet." Whip in hand, be naused beside his' ndray to listen intently, then, speak indg softly to his bullocks, he resumed the homeward journey. :"Queer go!' he muttered; "might ha-ve known something was o oming, by the way 'I felt. Well, it's up to me now anyhow." he For twenty minutes he steadied his team along the 'downward road, sheering off the hard road on to the sire track wherever the going there was easier, and resting once or twice 'to lst- n with ear to the ground for the sound of police pursuit which he knew must .come.' ApproachTing the flat' land of the valley, nith the cart going almost noiselessly cin . the deep dust of ade side track, the driver again stayed his foot to turn an alert ear along the backward road. it Just so." hewhispered, "now fnor At the foot of 'the slope the blush' was left behind, and thes driver and team nassbed out into the soft star lioht of the" suminer sky.u Fromh behind came the near-drawing clat Ster of horses' hoofs and the sound of imen's voicesin jerky conversation. The youth fell bick bheside the dray,. and, speaking softly, sfaidi 2"They're commg; keen dark, leave 1it to me!" Then, cracking his .hip loudl and singeing in assumed casrelessnss, he sauntered beside his As the leading rider overtook hint his heart ~beat a tattoo on his ribs, Iand. dropping his melody, he manri- I ed to call a nonchalant "good night." c Three , other horsemen drew up to a walking pace abreast' of the first. Two carried rifles slung-across their shoulders, and all had double holsters in their saddles. None were in uniform, hut from the '1appearance of theiir horses and their seatin the saddle, the lad readily re co nised that they were police. Probably b,ecause in the days of his 'infancy the "bobbv" had been ':made the bogey man of all bush chil dien, and from a nainful family an~ thee~ an indefinable sense of un easness.and fear in the presehce of a strange' policeman. Looking up jat the face of the mani who had 'r idelanup fratk s iifta aquiline pro 

 file was silLouetted aaainst' the le sky. he recognised with a sense relief a sergeant whom he had for. merly met in a township beyond the ranges. "Hallo, Mr. Redmond!" he ex claimed. "Who are you?" asked the ser gea nt. "Bob Morgan," he said, "son of William Morgan, in the valley here; My father's a Justice of the Peace, yo.u know," le added with a touch of imnortance feeling that the. i. formation might not he without du effect on the officer of the Law. "Oh. yes, yes,-" said the sergeant= formally assenting to a statement. the t:utbh of which he had no pei sonal knowledge. "I met you last year, when I wi -up youar way, staying with my, %w sir s, the Benthorpes," continue Bob. "I recollect- you now," said thl sesgenat: "and how far have _5i, come to-night'l" "Oh! iight from town- to-day' sail Bob, anxious to appear at ea. "Been in with a load of last yea oits. The old man hung oni. l-ng. We've lost 4d. per busliel them. I've a lot. more tc--" "Did any horseman nass you on the road. since nightfall?" intei+ ed the sergeant. "No, sir, not one. I've pas no horseman either way since lea ing Rockdale." "Anyovbne onr foot ?" asked the ser. geant. sharply, his keen ear having caught a slight. and. unconscolA emnhasis on the word "horsema?.i "No, no orte on' foot 'either.' was juFst thinking, as I cam alof 'no lonely the road was to-ni Heaw] some shootin' a.way babck"i Stra~neway's ohad paddock just after sundown. Were you after-ayon, ser.eant ?" "Then you met nobody ?" cQ�i tinned the officer, ignoring?,the ouary. "No: just heard shooting alo way off, and saw a flash or two.::iS5 nose it was coves around the edge the !hush after 'possums." "Good nghbt," said the seriak bre'king .ijto a canter, and, �' . 0Nkht," returned the lad wi!th ; sense of relief, as the police ? cl-ttered off. When the sound of .their going4 died away in the disthnce:e.;:Bb vaulted into the drav. and raisinig fla.vn of the tnrpaulin. said softl "'Did you hear them? That was:t,, ti tps all right." Gett'ng no reply. hi stooped asn listened; " and hearing only regula, brepthing, ;he let the flap gently7, fa again. "Asleep -dead to the worhl' sa;i. "Luck so far anyhow." Thence ;onward - for three mere miles he said no word. His mn was husy with consideration, of to, difficulty ahead of him. His. father was a man stern and strict. in resnect for Pocial order and probit of Ffe. Oftenr he had heard h sonak in condemn.ation of all Ia.a.w breakers. In his father's eyes iht w-s no extenuation of theft espep . ailv, and robbery under arms wasti offonce which, according to his.code should be punished as of old by p;?i. lie execution. - One of Bob's earliest and saddei recollections was of a time' of glooii and misery in his own. home, iwh his father and mother had for months, which succeeded a b'iitt o~arrel, lived as stransers to ot1er, and when he daily saw In mother in tears. The cause of tihi trouble had been an offence agseam the lsiv committed by his half-b". ther, Harr.v Cunningham. What& tWi offence was he did not know at the time, though later he lea~nt it was the common bush crime of hors&ii stealing. Harry; then a lad in hiiin 'teens, had been taken away byth police. and despite his mother's tearful pleadings, William Morganh had refused to intervene in any way This had occurred before their m.? Pration to Pleasant Valley and after Harry's removal from their houris by the police he had nevey' seen his half- brother again.} His father had forbidden men. tion of his name, and gradual???

 must trust to luck. I hope the old man - is not about, anyhow." As it happened he met his father at 'the gate which opened off the road and led to the outbuildings of the Lomestead. William Mo'rgan was mounted, and was returnmng f om the townshin absorbed in thoughts of some 'business which left him time for no more than a curt salute and brief inquiries con cernins his son's journey to and: from the city. The lad's heart felt relieved of a load of doubt and fear heavier than he had, perhaps, realised. His bro ther. Jim, who had come down to the gate to meet him, was taken into 'immediate whispered confi dence. "I. will take the dray behind the barn, Jim,' he added, "and I want you to run to the but and tell Andy' on the quiet to come up as soon as he ran." , Jim' ran off to Andy's sleening ouarters, and, in a few minutes, both were at the barn. Bob had the stranger, who was obviously weak ard unable to sqpport himself,. al ready out of the dray. ' He was .resting in a limp and hopeless atti tude against the jamb of the barn door. ' ?"Up to the loft with him, Andy, and. look sharp," said Bob. "Bear a hand, Jim." Once inside and the vdoor closed,' Andv lit a ,lantern, and between them, he and Jim helped the wound ed man up the 'ladder. Drawing the drayv some little dis- I tance aloof, Bob unyoked the bnl locks and 'reioined Andy and his brother in the high loft of the barn. "Vat :haf de poor shap oop vit him, Bob- " asked Andv. Bob nut his mouth to Andy's ear and whisnere 1 a reply. "Yes, yoost so' voost ~ol noor. shap !_noor slian !" said.the Swede in a softer tone. "Go ,vayv an' oet vour tea, Bob, an'-vell, vait a 'bit-ves.: I tink so: you vas bedder nod tnlA your mudder, Bob, nod yed, nod yed." - "All right, if you think so,' Ady,", replied Bob; and, after 'a wash at the yard pumm, he put on his coat and entered the house. After .ex chanaing -orpetinus with his mother, he sea.ted himself at the table, too absorbed in thought to' have much to Isay. " "You are very tired, my sonl"V asked. "Mrs. Mornsi, .with- her usual tone of quiet solicitude. "Yes; hjother-that is, middlinrwz" said Bob, "but I'll he all right after some tes and a snell." Few furthet words nassed between them during the meal: and, on the, nwete"t of looking after some stores still in the dray. the lad returned to the barn. Here he found that' Andy had already excavated from! among b- s- of chaff and grain a spoce sufficient to hold a stretch er. and Allow of .s"ee to walk amorund it. On this Fred Forbes was stroteh. ed, lookivn very pale and ehsastly in. the dim light of the lantern, and with the aid of a bucket of water, broriht by Jim, the Swede was washing away- blood. stains and pre-. p.rinr to dress the sick man's wounds. "I. don't tink it vas' too bat." he was saving in a reassuring- whisper. "Dere vas only von ballet, an' it b af rone in an' oud va.in, -t'rough de lef shonlaer: see,lBob." Pob looked and after careful ex amins.t*ion of the usbrfinR mer's body, a.creed that nb other injury was to be' seen. � After making the ie?wr ahle man ns comfcrtabs as nossibleh, Bob and Jim removed from the drayv some sacks showinr blood stains, and lea.ving the patient in-the care of Andy, wtint awav silently to hed.

The two ]a9s and Andy aocretlv thinistfred to his Iwan+s, walline him in with, sacks no~ chaff which looked nart of a >?;-' stack. whenever all were compelled to be away frshn the 'barn at the same time. William Mosr~an, care ful' farmer and strict father and master though he was, had nev-r known cause to distrust big Andv or-his sons, For vents. he had not visited the barn loft. leaving the storage .and distribution of all the farm products .to: the Swede. Now' Andy took .ere :thst "no one -else than the lads 'and himself ever end: tered the barn door. He kept it locked against the harvest 'hands and other casual labourers, on the plausible pretext that maa.v of them were not to be trusted where odd ments of machinery were about, and' that even the irost honest of them were too 'fond of smoking to be saaf about a valuable building contaihing hundreds of pouinds' worth of im plements and pi;roducts. For a, week or so after Fred Forbes' dash across the ranges, the vicinity of his- disepearance waJ clos~ely s?oured bry the poieo. ie 

 horse and saddle were found, and every probable nook and gully in the hills was closely seardhed by not only the officers of the law,. bit by others to whom the Government' rewar'd was a strong incentive. The story of the chase and the running fight was told at length in the p.,ners, and Bob winced when hid father said. "What a pity the scoun drel was not shot Men like him are a disgrace to civilisation. They are criminal savages, and should be shown no mercy." Meanwhile the sick man. in the barn soft mended slowly. The lads noticed, during the latter days of his hiding that be had became some what reserved towards them, and, anparentlv, very confidential. with Andy. To Bnb this without being the cause of offense, 4 as a trifle puz zling. "I suppose he thinks me too young, to know anythine of his life or In tentions," he said to himself. "I'd like a. chance to ask him to keeP, straight, but he never &:ve. me one But Andy will advise hin all right. and perhaps he thinks a lot more than he says to me." On ('hristmas Eve Fob went to the loft after tea, to see how the patient was doing. To his astonishment h' found the sick man up and dres-ed. and' en a??,as in rolling n sway, madr^ up of blanket which had been bought bv.And'. To tha laA's look of sur -rise he answered with an explanar tion. "I'm off to-nieht," he s.?ai, hold - ing down hia head an-r turone away at a stren.

' Without further worxd@the bro left the building and turnied their steps towards the house. -- 1 For hal" an hour n?n A.Fred Forbes and Andy sat in senous con versation; then the Swede, after leaving the barn for a few minutes, returned, and said "Come on1!" Following his guide the refugee emerged from his. hiding place, and, iith "teatlihy feet, entered the or chard which adjoined the rear aspect, oj the house. After being lost to? view among the fruit trees for a brief interval, Fred's lank fiagure emerged on an ?en plot near the lbu3ding.

Then, turning quickly, he crept auietly away, and rejoined Andy among the shadows of the orchard trees. Neither spoke as they walked slowly back to the darkness of the barn. On Christmas morning Andy was about as usual, and the leoft appear ed as if it had never known the p-esence of its recent tenant. To Bob's questioning look Andy re sponded- with bref words. "He will be all right now. It is fixed dat vay.

It was very inappronri ate +o the season of gladness in Aus tralia, for it had on it frosty Pic-. t"res of F.?ther Christmas enc;rcl'd with wreaths of red-berried holly.. But the device was nothing--the words were all. "A Merry Clrrist. mas, mother. I'm on the rt-ePiht track now. Look out for a letter by-and-bye from Harry."
