 PLAIN LIVING.

 The thnll of pleasure with which this pro 

 posal was received showed itself in the flush ing cheeks and brightened eyes of Laura and her sister�while upon Mrs. Stamford's 

 features an almost patnetic expression ap 

 peared, as of a revelation of joy, sndden and unhoped-for. " You are so kind, Harold ; but on, are you prudent? Think of the ex pense�new dresses, new everything indeed. Why, it seems an age since I saw Sydney !" 

 "Thinkof the clip, Mrs. Stamford," re torted her husband. "Think of the Iambs, think of the fat sheep ready for market Your journey to town will be the merest trifle of expenditure compared to what we can law fully and reasonably afford. I speak in sober earnest Besides, the Intercolonial Exhibi tion is open. The girls may never have such another chance. Hubert must stay at home for fear of bush fires, JScc. He shall have his holiday when we return. So, girls, the great Windahgil migration is settled." 

 The departure of a family that has long dwelt in the "bush," or veritable far country division of Australian life, for the metropolis is an event of no ordinary magnitude. Not that the conditions of their rural life are so widely different from conntrylife in England. There is the country town within reasonable distance, to which visits are by no means in frequent There reside the clergymen, law yers, doctors, bankers, teachers, and trades people, the chief component parts of rural society�as in England. There are also various retired non - combatants, decayed gentry, and others,- the poor and proud section�as in Europe. Tne squirearchy is represented by large-acred, wealthy per sonages, who have either acquired or in herited estates, exceeding ten or twenty-fold in value those of average proprietors�as in Europe. These great people are frequently absent, but contribute fairly by a higher scale of expenditure, often comprising pic ture galleries and valuable collections of oqjets (Tart, generally to the mental advancement of the neighbourhood. It is not to be Bnpposed either that they are for the most put unedu cated or unrefined. 

 It follows, therefore, that even when de prived of access to metropolitan privileges the families of rural colonists are not wholly without the means of acquiring or retaining intellectual privileges, invariable as has been the custom of the British novelist to depict them aB living a rude, unpolished, mid wholly unlettered life. Inordinary Seasons It Is the custom for aquatters of a certajn rank to visit the metropolis* with their families once a year, if not oftener. The pleasures of city life are then moderately partaken of, fresh ideas are acquired, old tastes are indulged, friendships are con tracted, repaired, or revived, mental and physical benefits unspecified are acquired, ana after a lew weeks' absence the country family returns, much contented with their experiences, and perfectly ready to await the chimging year's recurrence ere another mo mentous journeying takes place. 

 But when, as at Windahgil, a succession of untoward seasons brings tne family ark well nigh to wreck and ruin, it iB obvious that no such holiday-making can be thought of. " Cer tainly not tins year, perhaps not next year;?': says Paterfamilias, sorrowfully but firmly. Then, doubtless, au the reserved are called up; steady, instructive readingmuBt take the place of' travel, old acqn&utahcea whoBe minds,so to spes^b&vebeenx^d through ahd through,andaog,s-earedbesides<tnpatfperforce be endured through lack Of charmingly-new, i fresh, romantically-respectful? * 

 I old dresses ure tuned and � 

 trimmed, and their terms of service 

 lengthened, every economical device, pa- j thetic in the patience and true Jjo^ly virtae displayed. But though, I sny, all these substitutes and makeshifts are availed or, the time docs pass a little "wearily, monoto nously. , , , � . . 

 But now the " route" was given,the delignt ful signal had sounded. The sudden change or 

 ideas necessitated by the announcement or i Mr. Stamford was at first bewildering to his wife and nearly in an equal degree to his daughters. Calculation and arrangement were required, such forecasting as to where they were to go first, when they could possi uly be ready to start, maternal doubts as to what poor Hubert would do in their absence, as the maids would necessarily return to their friends. These weighty considerations absorbed so much time and thought that it was generally agreed to be a species of miracle by which the family found themselves safely packed in the waggonette one memorable Monday on the way to Moramah railway station, the luggage having been sent on by a cart in the early morhing. _ 

 " Boor dear Hubert! it seenis so selfish to leave him at home by himself," said Laura ; "I think one of us ought to have Btaycd to keep house for him." 

 " It is not too late now, said Linda. " Which is it to be ? Shall we toss up ? Im quite ready if I lose." 

 " No ; I will stay," said Laura. I am the 

 Gldcsti" 

 "I think I will stop after all," said Mrs. Stamford. " You two girls are due for a little enjoyment, and it does not matter so 

 much about me." 

 " You will do nothing of the sort, said Mr. Stamford, with rather more emphasis than usual. ' Your mother wants a change as much as any of ua It's only good of you girls to be ready to rCmain; and it pleases me, my dears. But Hubert is man enough to look after himself, as well as the station, for a month or two. AVhen our holiday is up, his will beein." � 

 " Ab if I would have let anybody stop, 

 said Hubert, " let alone the dear old mater; bless her old heart. How am I to do when I go to the Never Never country, do you suppose�and I must have a turn there some da3'� if you all coddle me up so ?" 

 " I hope you never will go to that dreadful new country," said Mrs. Stamford, half tear fully. "Didn't you read that shocking ac count of the poor fellow who died of thirst by the telegraph line the other day, besides that nice young Belford, who was killed by 

 the blacks." 

 "Accidents will happen, my dear old mother," said Hubert " The British em pire wouldn't be what it is if every mother kept her boy at home, so that she could see him while she knitted warm socks for him. Windahgil is paying fairly now, but there's no fortune to be made here, is there, sir? A man might as well be in England." 

 " I didn't know that you were growing dis contented with your lot, my boy," said tbe father, looking admiringly at the clear eyes and bold brow of his firstborn; " but there's time enough to think about all that I'll see when we're all settled at home again. There goes the belL We must take our places. God bless you, my boy." 

 The following morning found the Stamford family comfortably deposited in one of the hotels which in Sydney combine proximity to the sea with perfect accessibility from all the city centres. Baths and breakfast bad removed all traces of fatigue or travel discomfort Laura, with her sister, was standing at a window which overlooked the sea, wild with delight at the unaccustomed glory of the ocean. 

 "Oh! what a lovely, lovely sight!" cried Linda. "Look at that glorious bay, or rather series of bays, with those white-winged boats flying across jt like Beabirds�it is an old simile, I know, but it always sounds nice. Look at the rocks and promontories, beaches and islands! And there a great ocean steamer is moving majestically along, as if she was going to sail up to the verandah. Wouldn't it be nice if she did. I wonder 

 what the people would be like. Oh ! I shall expire with 3oyand wonder if I stay here much longer." 

 "Thenput on your bonnet and come to George-street with me," said Mrs. Stamford. " I want to do a little quiet shopping before lunch. Laura can stay with her father. He is going to take her to see the Grandisons." 

 "Oh, how nice! I haven't seen a real shop," said Linda, "like Farmer's and David Jones's, you know, since I was a little girl. That will tone down the excitement a little, or give it a new direction. Oh, I do feel so happy! Do you think it will last, mother ? It can't be any better in England�or fairyland. The world does not offer anything superior to my present feeling of perfect�yes, perfect�hap piness. Don't let ns go to the opera for a week yet, till 1 have had time to subside. I feel like a glass of champagne; I should effer vesce over. La 1 la, la, la, la! la, ia, la!" And here the excited girl waltzed into her bed room to the tune of " Venetia." 

 When Mrs. Stamford and her youngest daughter departed on their shopping expedi tion, the latter declaring that she felt the greatest difficulty in restraining herself from bursting into song from pure gladsomeness of heart, her father betook himself in a cab with Laura to Mr. Grandison's house, where he proposed to deposit her, with her cousin Josie. till his return in the evening. Laura was little less inwardly delighted with her genual surroundings than Linda, but not bung so highly demonstrative, she did not testify her pleasure by bodily movement. Yet was her heart filled with innocent joy and honest admiration as she surveyed the 

 unwonted scene. 

 As their carriage wound slowly up one of the steep ascents by which, on leaving the city proper, the more fashionable suburbs are reached, her dark eye sparkled and her fair cheek glowed while she pointed out the fresh combination of sea and shore. 

 'Oh. father!" she said, "when you look| 

 on this does it not seem 

 upon this does it not seem strange that any 

 one should choose to live away from the seat I should spend half my time on the beach. What changeful beauty. What new wonders arise even Bom this tiny outlook 1 Nothing can be more delicious than this harbour, with gardens and lawns down to the very ends of the promontories. The dear little hays, too, like fairy pictures, with smooth Bhores and a big rock with an archway here and there. And oh! the headst Grand and majestic, are they not?�frowning above the restless deep like eternal ocean portals. I can see billows, I declare. How vast and awe-striking! I am really thankful we bavetf t been to Sydney all these bad seasons. A day like this is worth a year of common lifer . 

 v That's an extravagant price to pay for | a ddby'e pleasure, pussy," said her father fondly, ss be watched the fire of enthusiasm glow in the girl's bright eyes, which seemed to dilate ana sparkle at intervals as if the glory of the grand vision had been transfused into her very blow. " You will count your Years, sua most people ido their money, much �ire carefully as you grow older. But I 

 " i�t, that ;yoowiu have long years of 

 nityie you, and th&$ thig is $ot 

 the only one of earth's precious things that' 

 you will enjoy." 

 " What a divine pleasure travel must be," said she, gazing steadfastly before her, as if looking out upon a new world of wonder and enchantment " Think of seeing, with one's own very eyes, all the cities and battle-fields of the earth, the shrines ot tiie dead, im mortal past Oh ! to see Rome and Venice. Athens and the Greek Isles, even dear ola

 sensation is often overpowering," remarked 

 Mr. Stamford, with an inward smile, as he 

 = �< n..� r 

 recalled his own recent experience. " But I 

 hope you and Linda will qualify yourselves 

 liOpC )'UU UUU XJin\\xu. m � 

 by study for an intelligent appreciation of all the marvels of the old world, /hat is, 

 he added, " in the event of your being fortu nate enough to get there, "e colonists have a great deal to learn in art and literature,' as Lord Kimberley was phased to say the other day. We must show that we are not altogether without a glimmering of taste and attainment" , ,, 

 "That is the fixed British idea about all colonists," Baid Laura with indignation. ' I suppose Lord Kimberley thinkB we do nothing but chop down trees and gallop about all day. Well, one mustn't boast, but we have been getting on with our French and German lately, and Linda's sketches show some thing more than amateur work, 1 think.' 

 When they drove up at Chatsworth, and the cabman was opening the gold and bronze coloured iron gates, Laura's ccstacies broke 

 out anew. 

 " Ok. father, do look; did ever you Bee such a beautiful place ? Look at the gravel, look at the flowers, look at the sea, which makes a foreground for the whole picture. Look at that purple mass of Bougainvillea covering all one side of the house. Look at the lawn, like a big billiard table. It is a morsel of fairyland. How happy they must be in such a perfect home." 

 " Humph!" said Mr. Stamford ; " perhaps the less we say about that the better. The people that live in the best houses do not al ways lead the pleasantest lives. But it cer tainly is a show place." 

 It was truly diflicult to overpraise the Chatsworth house and grounds. Nature had been very bountiful, and every beauty was heightened, every trifling defect corrected by art The gravel of which the drive was com posed was in itself a 6tudy. Its dark red colour, its perfect condition, daily raked and rolled as it was to the smoothness of a board. Rare shrubs, massed flowers, choice ferns, bordered its accurately-defined tiled edges. 

 The bright blue blossoms of the jacaranda I mimos&folia, the star flowers of the hibiscus, 

 the broad purple aud green leaves of the I 

 coleus, the waving, restless Bpirc-sof thepine, the rustling, delicate banana fronds, all these, 

 and a host of tropical plants, which the mild, ? moist air of the .Sydney winter suffers to flourish in the open air, were here Lawns and stone-paved fountains, tennis-grounds, shaded walks, all were to be found in this tiny desmesne, every yard of which had been measured and calculated so as to produce the largest amount of effect and convenience. The hot-house and green-houses were under the care of an autocratic Scotch gardener, who treated Mr. Grandisou's suggestions with silent contempt, and obeyed or defied Mrs. Grandison's orders as to fruit and flowers en tirely as it seemed good to him. 

 Mrs. Grandison was at home. The footman I 

 admitted so much as he asked the country | 

 cousins into a morning room�a most grand apartment to their eyes ; nevertheless, Mrs. Grandison's countenance � she was there alone�wore a clouded and dissatisfied expression. She relaxed considerably, though with an effort, as her visitors were announced, and came forward to greet them warmly enough. 

 "So glad to see you, Mr. Stamford. It was nice of you to bring Laura. Why, you look as fresh as a rose, child. How do you manage to have such a complexion in a hot district? I tell Josie she's getting as pale as a ghost, and yellow, too. The fact is she goes out too much, and the Sydney climate is enough to wear anyone out She hasn't been down to breakfast yet�naughty girl�bat she was at the Moreton's ball last night Mrs. Watch tower took her, and she didn't get home till 

 past 4 o'clock." j 

 " I suppose Grandison's in town?" said Mr. Stamford. 

 "Oh, yes; he goes in regularly every day, though I often tell him I don't know what he has to do. He Lunches at his club; yon'll! find him there at one o'clock. He says it's dull 

 enough there, but nothing to what it is if be j stopBat home. Not very complimentary, is 

 it? 

 But men are all alike: they like to get 

 away from their wives and families." 

 I've brought mine with me this time, yon see; so I dont fall under your disapproval" 

 "Oh! I do think yon pretty good, as men go, though there's no knowing. But, Laura, 

 yon'd better go up to Josie's room, if yon ] want to have a talk, or else there's no telling how long yon may have to wait Now, Mr. ; Stamford, when will yon all come and dine; 

 to-day you'll be tired�to-morrow or next day,! which shall it be�and we'll have somebody to make it a little lively for the girls t' 

 " I think the day after to-morrow, if it is equally convenient," Baid Stamford. "And now I most go, as I have some business to attend to. I will leave Laura, with your per mission, and call for her as I return in the afternoon." 

 " Oh 1 yes, by all means. Josie will enjoy a long talk with her. What a fine girl she has grown, and so handsome too. She wants! dressing a bit But how do yon manage to getall that fine bloom in the bush? I thought Windahgil was a hot place, yet Laura looks as fresh as a milkmaid." 

 " She is a good girl, and has had very little dissipation, we lead very simple lives in the bush, you know. My daughters are very un sophisticated as yet" , i 

 " That's all very well but being simple doesn't give beauty or style, and Laura seems to have a very fair share of both. You let her come to the assembly ball next week that all the girls are talking about, and see what a 

 sensation she'll make." 

 " If there is a ball while we Me down I should not think of denying the girls a legitimate pleasure, tkough lAnda is rather 

 flatter Laura" legitimate pleasure, though 

 young yet: but I think you | 

 " Not a hit. It's her fresh, natural manner that will strike everybody, and the way all her face seems to speak without words. Her eyes are perfectly wonderful Why didn't yon tell us she was such a beauty and had a charming manner?" 1 . 

 " To my mind it's rather a disadvantage

 then otherwise�the beauty, not the manner, of course"�said Mr. Stamford, philosopl cally. '' I beg von won't inform her of the fact, though I really don't think she'd believe yon, my dear Mrs. Grandison. But I must go now, 

 so good-bye for the present," 

 <vIt is pearly lunch time now," said Mrs. Grandison; " you may as well stay, and go to town afterwards."
