 THE COUSINS; OR, ADVENTURES IN THE BUSH. 

 AN early summer's day, in all the glorious sunlight of the bright genial climate of Austra-<*> lia, ushers in our narrative. The scene lies in the bush, and opens in a forest that intervenes 

 between two large sheep stations in' the interior, some hundreds of miles to the west of Sydney. The day was one of those delightful compounds of sunshine and light cool breeze that helps to make this climate one of the pleasantest that can be obtained in any part of the world. A few light fleecy clouds sailed lazily across the dear blue sky, and interposing now and then between the sun's rays and the earth added to the coolness of the day, and relieved and beauti fied the woodland scenery by a chequering of �hade, �for, notwithstanding the incredulous manner in which any favorable remark about Australian scenery is generally met with by natives of the older climes, there is a beauty unique in its kind, even in its harshness and want of luxuriance: The ironbark trees, with their dark, rugged stems, and the tall guma, with their bare trunks and limbs, and light green leaves, poEsess a grim majesty, which is not to be found in the branching, full-foliaged trunks and shorter stature of the denizens pf the Euro pean forests. The bright-colored, shrill-voiced birds too, tbat climb among the blossoms of the trees and dart through their branches, seem perfectly natural to the aceae. And lastly, the fern-covered ground, the bandicoots haunt through which the wild dog stealthily prowls and the beautiful but dangerous snake drags its glittering form, adds a finish to the landscape, and tends to give it that aspect of eternal soli tude that so strongly characterises the Australian scenery. Through this forest wound a road�the usual bush road�leading from Beula township to the various stations in communication with it. On the day we are speaking of, at about the hour of noon, a young man was riding along in the direction of a neighboring station known by the name of Gwalior. Charles Carlton, for such was this young man's name, was a colonial gentleman of some twenty-six summers stand. ing. His appearance was decidedly prepossess ing, for a good firm forehead, round which clustered a profusion of dark-brown curls, was supplemented by an honest manly face, lit up with a pair of fine brown eyes. His history, and what led him to the spot where he first comes under our notice, need very little expla nation. Both of his parents having died when he was quite young, he had been brought up by his two guardians, who fulfilled their trust by attending to his being well educated, his father having left ample means for that purpose, and then sending him at the age of seventeen to gain colonial experience on a sheep station in which one of them had an interest. As he would come in for a few thousands shortly after reaching his twenty-first year, this was probably the best course they could pursue to enable their ward to obtain a good start in life. He had re mained for some six years on this station, tak-. ing now and then a trip to Sydney, where, though destitute of relations, he had a good many friends and acquaintances. After the six yean were past, he had undertaken a voyage to England and a run over the continent to en- large his views a bit, and to satisfy the usual curiosity of colonial youth respecting the older countries. On his return to Sydney, he deter mined either to take up country on his own account in one of the outlying districts of the colony, or to purchase an interest in a station in one of the more settled ones. It was princi pally in pursuance of this design, and partly to redeem a promise made to its owner of visiting him, that he was now on his way to Gwalior. Leaving his luggage to be brought on from the township by one of the station drays, he had started for Gwalior, by himself, on horseback. After riding a few miles further on, emerging from the forest into a plain, he came in sight of the station posted on a hill about a mile off. Having come along from the station where he had passed the previous night at an easy pace, his horse was still fresh; so putting him into a gallop, he soon cleared the ground that inter vened between the forest and the hill, and a few minutes more found him outside the fence at the back of the station house. " Halloa! is that you, Carlton ?" rung out the cheery voice of John Townsend, the owner of Gwalior. " Thought we were never going to see you, my boy. Needn't ask how you are; your looks are enough. Giro Tom your horse and come along in." As directed, Carlton gave up his horse to one of the men that were about, and followed his host, an ex-Indian officar, into the house�a good, substantial wooden erection of some seven ?T�r eigiu ft>c4B%r^\\ ith a deep versndcli in front overlooking the plain. Under the guidance of his conductor, Carlton traversed the house by a hall that went through its centre, and was ushered into the sitting-room of the establish lishment, which opened on to the verandah. Two young ladies were seated on a couch at the window, who rose aa they entered. "My dears, Mr. Charles Carlton. Carlton, my niece Clara Walden and my daughter Edith." Mutual salutations were interchanged by the parties thus brought together, and with more sincerity than is generally employed in such cases, for the advent of a handsome, well-bred young man is a godsend to young ladies in the bush ; and the society of the latter on a station in the interior is a great rarity and one to be duly appreciated when met with. Clara Walden was of a type of girl that in clined more to the Spanish or Italian than to the English. Dark hair, and darker eyed, a fair complexion, nose inclining to aquiline, and a �mall, well-shaped mouth, were matched by a tall, well-proportioned figure. An orphan and an heiress, she had been under the care of her uncle since her tenth year, and had, since the age of^sixteen, when her school days had finished, resided with him and her cousin on Gwalior. The life, perhaps, was rather a tame one for a girl of her appearance and expectations, but her uncle had not thought fit up to that time to entrust her to the care of anyone in Sydney, and the calls of business necessitated his constant residence on his station. At the time she is introduced to the reader, she had just com pleted her eighteenth year, though her appear ance would have warranted anyone in putting her age down at twenty. Edith Townsend was of nearly the same ag e as her cousin, being only three months older. In point of appearance she was rather eclipsed by her beautiful cousin, still she was a really pretty girl. A finely chiselled forehead, bright, frank, hazel eyes, straight nose, and rosy month) 

 were the constituents of a face over which spread the bloom of nature's coloring, which, like the hues that deck the flower, is derived alone from the touch of the Maker's hand. It did not take Carlton long to settle down into the life at Gwalior, which was not a very difficult one for a young man of his age. Be yond visiting the neighboring stations to ascer tain what they were like, and whether in the event of any of their owners being willing to come to an arrangement it would be worth his while to close with them, he did not trouble himself much about his business affairs. Per haps the not over energetic nature of a colonial youth had something to do with his taking things so easy j but there was also another and stronger reason, and one which he himself was scarcely aware of for, to say truth, the constant society of a charming girl like Clara Walden, had be gun more or less to affect the tender suscepti bilities of Charles Carlton. During the first few days of his stay at Gwalior he had not thought much of either of the young ladies, beyond that they were very pleasant companions. But the fascinating beauty of Miss Clara soon began to exercise a slight ascendency over his feelings. He had perhaps in his time seen as attractive a girl before, but be had never known what it was to be thrown in continued intercourse with one, as he naturally was by his present position. It is true tbat Edith might have acted as a counterpoise to her cousin, had she possessed more showy qualities than she did; but what ever might be her chances in the long run, in a contest of rivalry with her cousin, at the com mencement she was totally overborne by the more striking beauty of the former. Strangely enough, there arose between the cousins, shortly after Carlton's arrival, a slight feeling of coolness and a half suspicious manner at times of looking at one another, especially on Clara's part. Probably it is not very correct to say that it was strange, for however great may be the love between girls, it takes it all to bear with equanimity the test of seeing another, or fancying they see another, sup planting them in the good graces of one of the opposite sex for whom they have any liking. We have said that this was more marked in Clara than in her cousin, for the former could not help noticing the impression she was making on Carlton, and out of girli�h vanity, if for no reason, was desirous of preserring it. Doubt less, if anything, it was far more a feeling of triumph in her superior powers of attraction than from any sentiment akiu to love, that en gendered this state of mind in Clara. Carlton certainly would not be a bad prize, even in a worldly sense, for any girl; but, though Miss Clara's views on such subjects were yet very in definite, she had some idea that, with her at tractions, personal and pecuniary, she might try for a little higher prize whenever she entered into the matrimonial lists. In the meanwhile she was not at all avene to doing a little love making with a gentleman of Carlton's demeanor. As for Edith, she had too muoh sense to rush into love, and too much goodness of nature to care very much about a serious flirtation. Still she admired young Carlton, and could not quite restrain a feeling of pique at witnessing the in fluence her cousin was beginning to exercise on him. As time went on, Carlton was obliged to own to himself that his predilections for Clara Wal den were getting rather stronger than was exactly prudent, unless he really made up his mind to follow them up. Before he could think of doing this, however, there were one or two questions which required to be satisfactorily answered to himself. Notwithstanding the many little encouraging tokens, of real or feigned affection, which he had received from Clara, he had, somehow or other, considerable doubts as to her entertaining a serious regard for him. The nature, too, that showed itself in the frank hazel eyes of her cousin Edith was one that was decidedly worth looking into. As for old Townsend, being perfectly satis fied respecting Carlton's thoroughly gentlemanly nature, he did not trouble himself much as to whether either his daughter or niece took it into their heads to fall in love with him, or not. The life Carlton led at Gwalior was pleasant enough. When not on a visit to one of the neighboring stations�which, as before hinted, was not very frequent�he usually spent the morning in assisting Townsend in the perform ance of some one of his station duties, and the afternoon in riding about or otherwise passing the time with the ladies. Such, then, had been the effect, on himself and others, of Carlton's residence at Gwalior, when, about a month after his arrival, the ad ventures we are about to chronicle, and upon which our narrative hangs, took place. A beautiful afternoon, rather warm than otherwise, had been the time chosen for a trip to some cascades on the river a few miles dis tant from the houee. The weather for some time past hod been dry and warm, and the land- < �^&pe, which, was io^BaTiaw^?y fresh when | Carlton first arrived on the station, had latterly begun to wear rather a yellowish garb. The three equestrians�Carlton, Clara, and Edith� ; cantered cheerily across the plain that stretched from beneath the station house to a forest some three miles off, talking and joking pleasantly enough as they went along. Their intention was to reach the banks of the river at a place in the forest where a glade opened out for about fifty yards from the stream. At this point, and for some hundreds of yards above and below it, the river rushed through a number of rocks that obstructed its passage, forming a series of small but beautiful cascades and rapids. As the day advanced, a fresh, strong breeze got np, and blew in the direction of the river, adding materially to the pleasantness of the weather. Upon reaching the forest, they entered it by a cattle track that would lead them pretty close to their destination, and followed it down. To get through the woods by a straighter route would have been rather difficult, for the wet sea son that had been succeeded by a hot summer had caused the vegetation to grow up so strong and rapidly that it would have offered a serious impediment to the passage of any one through it. As they approached the glade they noticed that the air seemed rather hazy, which they at tributed to their nearing the river, from the banks of which they presumed the haze had risen. On reaching the glade they unsaddled their horses, and left them loose to graze about; they did not require hobbling, being too well trained to stray. Carlton, providing himself with a stick, beat down some of the tall grass which grew on a slight eminence that afforded them a good position from which to view the cascades. After watching for a time the play of the waters as they dashed between their rocky enemies, and sparkled like diamonds wherever the sun's rays fell glancing across their foaming current, they set themselves to enjoy a new novel Clara had just procured from Sydney; Carlton reading whilst his fair companions 

 listened, and made abstracted oata with their riding whips at the tops of the tall grass that grew within reach. They had been thus en gaged for about an hour's time, when a terrified neigh from their horses, accompanied by the sound of these animals galloping off into the bush startled them all, and brought them at once to their feet. It did not take long to find out the cause of this fright, on the part of their horses ; a wild bull who, in all probability, had j been defeated by some stronger rival, and driven I out from the herd, roaming sullenly through the \\ bush, had come in sight of and charged the J horses. Unfortunately for our three friends, they I had risen too quickly for their own safety, as ' the bull, who had gone no further than the im- ! petus of his charge carried him, in turning round, caught sight of the red Garibaldi which Clara wore. For a moment the bull gazed at the travellers, and the next he advanced at a quick walk towarks them, giving Tent to a few low bellows. " Oh heavens, he'll rash at me first, with this dreadful red thing on," screamed Clara, while the color fled from her cheeks and lips; for, though naturally possessed of a proud sort of courage for a woman, her thoughts of self, for the time, overcame it "Don't be frightened, dear. Here, let me help you pull it off," said Edith, who, though pale, did her best to keep composed. " No, no!" said Carlton, " there's no time for that. Give me your hands and we will make a rush for yonder tree; quick, it's our only chance to escape." Suiting his actions to his words, Calton seized hold of the hands of the two girls, and half dragging them through the high grass, far their habits sadly impeded them, he hurried along to where a low, but stout, branching tree, of the she-oak species grew. Upon reaching it, Carl ton picked up the two girls, one after the other, in his arm?, and lifted them up into the lower branches of the tree, which were sufficiently high off the ground to place them out of danger* Next, laying hold of a branch, he swung himself up after them. He was only just in time, the ferocious brute passing under him, as he effected a lodgement in the tree. Foiled in his aim, the savage beast, after making one or two half charges at the tree, and finding them useless, re tired to the nearest shade, and stood there look* ing at his prisoners with a look of sullen ferocity. Carlton endeavored to make the position of his companions and himself as endurable as pos sible. He helped them to get into the most com modious seats that the tree afforded, taking his own as near to them as their joint safety ad mitted of. The bull, he represented to them, would in all probability get tired of staying there, and their state of seige would oonse quently not last long. Still, notwithstanding these assurances, the two girls were, it must be owned, naturally enough, very much frightened, especially Clara, who could not refrain from a plaint or two, about the awkward position they were in. How long they might hare been kept in their preaent position, but for the adrent of a new character on the scene, it is hard to say. From * their places in the tree they naturally could see farther around them than when they were on the ground, but owing to the density of the forest and undergrowth, they were not able even from thence to see more than a few hundred yards into the surrounding bush. After they had been about half an hour in the tree, they became aware that quantities of ashes were fall ing around them. This, oombined with a cer tain faint noise, something like the roar of a dis tant gale, mingled with a crackling sound, and now and then a shock as if some tree or limb had fallen, caused them to arrive at the conclusion that a bush fire was going on to wind ward of them. As this was a oommon occur enoe, it did not at first cause much thought, and only called forth one or two remarks about it. But by-and-bye, when the ashes began to fall thicker, and the noise to increase in loudness, it suggested itself to Carlton, that at the rate the fire was travelling, it would reach them in lets than an hour. When he came to reflect on this, he could not help owning to himself and his companions, that such an event would render their position untenable. The glade, though not so full of the debris of timber, leaves, and bark, as the forest, was yet overgrown with very tall, dry grass. As the breeze was blowing strong, and the foliage of the tree in which they were was very dense, and consisted of needle shaped dry resinous leaves, the fire would sweep through it with great fury, and would infallibly barn them if they remained there. To escape from their present position, however, seemed impossible just then, without risking the sacri fice of at least one of their party, for the ball still kept his position in the shade of the neigh boring tree, and suspiciously watched them> There seemed therefore no hope but to wait and trust to the fire scaring the bull off and leaving them a chance to get away before it reached the tree ; and, with this hope, they were forced for the present to be content. After a while, the fire itself beoame visible to them, and truly it was a curious spectacle, and to any person not in imminent danger from it, would have been thoroughly enjoyable. It came along in a broad steady belt of flame, overwhelming and bearing everything down be fore it. Tall ferns and grass could be seen for an instant quivering in its breath, and the next they had vanished, with a rapidity that would have shamed the Wizard of the North, into flame and smoke. Now and then the fire would come across some gum tree shedding its bark* when the flames would leap up it as if rejoicing in their power of destruction, and sweep every vestige of bark from off it; or they would meet with a low, thick-leaved tree, and would rush through it with a crackling sound. Ever and anon the fire would reach the base of some hoi. low dead tree, whose fallen limbs had congre. gated around its butt, and would set it on fire- Then they would hear the flames roaring up this natural chimney, with a fierceness that re minded one of the description of the funnel of a racing steamer on the Mississippi, when the engine fires are being fed with bacon and hams for fuel. Carlton. and his companions watched the fire as it continued to advanoe, with a feeling almost akin to terror. There stood the bull keeping up his unremitting watch, perfectly heedless of the approaching flame�, which to him, with his thick hide, and strong square body, presented a very different appearance than they did to those upon whom he wished to wreak his vengeance. Fortunately for Carlton and his companions, he was possessed at heart, of a bold, cool spirit, and not giving way to any vain lamentation, he set himself to work to try and find out, if pos sible, some means of deliverance for them. As before remarked, the river was very rapid for some distance up and down its course, run ning between numerous rocks that checked and fretted its current. Close to the tree in which 

 our friends were, some dozen of these rooks were ranged, in an irregular line across the stream, forming a set of natural stepping stones. The rooks were placed at Tory uneven intervals, and the distance between several was considerable, the widest space being between the last rock and the opposite bank. It appeared to Carlton on viewing them, that if he could evade the bull, he might succeed in conveying his companions and himself to the other side by their means. Haying come to this conclusion, he informed his companions of it, who oonourred with him, and left it to him to do what he thought best. In a few words Carlton communicated his instruc tions: " m get down," he said, " and lead the bull off after me. While Ido this you must manage to creep through the grass to the rocks. I'll do my best to giro the bull the slip some little dis tance from this, and then run back and get you over before he finds it out. If, however, girls, I fail, and the brute catches me, you must try your best, even for the old gentleman's sake, to reach the other bank by yourselves, for the fire is too far down now to pass between it and the river." These directions given, Carlton took a serious but affectionate leave of his companions, and watching his opportunity, when the bull had turned away his head, he slipped as quietly down as he could, and made for the timber. The bull saw him ere he had gone more than a few yards, and came after him at a trot pre paratory to charging. As soon as Carlton got near a large enough tree, he stopped and faced the infuriated beast, keeping about a yard to the right of the tree, and waited for him to charge. He had not long to wait, for on getting within about forty paces from him the bull stopped for an instant, gave a low hoarse bellow, lowered his head and then came at him. Carlton never for a moment took his eyes from off the animal, but sprang nimbly aside behind the tree and let the brute pasa him. He then ran off in a direction that would take him away from his companions, until he had to stop and repeat the | same manoeuvre. Directly the bull had got into full chase after Carlton, Edith got down from the tree and helped her cousin to descend, for by a natural instinct the deeper mind took the lead in the hour of trial. She assisted Clara to take off her red jacket, whiob they hid among the long grass. This done, they orawled along to the bank, and crouched down under an over hanging tuft of tall grass, on a rock that jutted out from the bank, near their proposed crossing place. A few minutes afterwards, and they were rejoined by Carlton, who had managed to throw off the bull at about two hundred yards from where they were. "Thank God, for that muoh," he exclaimed, as he came up; " but quick, there is no time to be lost. Which of you shall I carry orer first ? You can't leap from rock to rock yourselves, and good jumper as I am, I expert it will tax my strength severely to do it." " Oh, take Clara first," said Edith, " she is bigger than I, and as I am the lightest it will be easier for you to take me when you're not so fresh." Carlton did not try to dispute this in any way, though he could not help thinking that Edith deserved being plaoed in safety first for her un selfishness ; so taking Clara in his arms, he com menced the passage. Notwithstanding that the rocks were worn pretty flat on the top, and offered a fair foothold, Carlton felt that it would never do to stop on any of them an instant longer than was requisite for getting his spring. To have rested, if even for a minute, on a small ledge of rook with the waters boiling and seeth ing round him, and a weight in his arms, would, most probably, have only unnerved him. Once started, on he went, and fortunately enough reached the other side in safety, and depositing Clara on the bank he returned across for Edith. It was his intention to have waited a minute or two, if possible, to recover breath, before at tempting the passage with Edith, but as he stood on the rock nearest the bank where she was, he caught sight of the bull coming back at a gallop towards them. Scarcely able to sup press the cry of dismay that rose to his lips, Carlton snatched Edith up in his arms and be gan his second passage. All went well till he came to the last leap, which, as before stated, was the widest of all. But the intense exertion he had already gone through, in evading the bull and carrying Clara across, had exhausted him, and falling short in his leap he missed the bank. With a slight cry of pain, as his legs were grazed by the sharp edges of the rock, Carlton fell back into the foaming current; but, partly through instinct and partly through pre sence of mind, he let Edith go, and she fell just on to the bank. Almost at the same moment the bull, who had reached the opposite side, made a spring to get on to the first rook. Half blinded with fury and smoke, he sprang right over it and fell headlong into the eddying_cur rent that bore him rapidly away. " G-ood heavens, Mr. Carlton will be killed!" cried Clara, from the bank whence she had wit nessed his fall and now saw him being rapidly carried down by the stream. " Oh, no, Clara, he mus'n't die," said Edith, in a voice of anguish. "We mus'n't let him go like this after all he's done to save us. Let's run down along the bank, and try and do some thing to prevent such a dreadful thing." Clasping her cousin's hand in her own, Edith ran along the bank as fast as she could, keeping all the while a watoh on Carlton, whose unavail ing struggles to reach the bank were getting weaker every moment. Once or twice they saw him swept underneath by the current, but he reappeared again. As he was thus being hur ried along, the current brought him close to a rock in the mid channel of the stream, to that side of it next to the bank where Edith and I Clara were, and they saw him make a despairing grasp at it. With joy, they observed that he had managed to get hold of its edges, and hang on to it. As soon as they got abreast of him, I Edith called out and asked what they should do ! to help him, but though they saw his head ! slightly move, they got no response. It became evident to them that his hold was the hold of a , fast drowning man, and that consciousness would soon leave him. For a minute the two girls ! stood looking at one another in mute despair, i then Edith broke the silence. 1 " See, Clara," she cried, " though we can't , possibly help him where he is, see that point of I rook that runs out into the stream, let's get out | on the end of it, and try and get hold of him as | be passes, for he'll let go directly, and the main ! current seems to pass pretty close to that point." Clara, her own danger being over, and who was by this time thoroughly stimulated by her cousin's brave example, agreed with her that, this was their best plan, and the pair ran down to the rock and got out on the end of it. " Now, Clara," said Edith, "if he passes within reach I'll lean forward as far as I can, and try and get hold of him, while yon keep a firm hold of me by my habit." 

 They had not long to wait, for hardly had they completed their arrangements, when they saw Carlton appear, borne along on the surface of the water, and quite insensible. With breathless anxiety the two girls watched him, as he was hurried rapidly towards them, every now and then spun round in some eddy. He neared the point one instant, and it seemed as if he would be swept past, clean out of their reach ; the next, and whirled round by the current, his head ju�t came within distance. Leaning for ward, Edith, who was kneeling on the very edge of the rock, managed to clutch hold of his hair with her right hand. With the strength of desperation, she drew him towards her, until his head touohed her face, when, taking hold of his hair between her teeth, she slipped her hands down and got a firm grasp of his coat collar. Trusting to the hold Clara had of her, she worked herself gradually round on to the rook, and drew Carlton under its lee, where he was out of the influence of the current. With Clara's assistance, she got safely on to the rock again without losing her grasp of Carlton. Clara then stooped over and took hold of Carlton by the coat collar, while Edith took him by the belt. In this manner they towed him along on the top of the water, to a part of the rook where its surface was nearer the water's edge; then with some little difficulty they lifted him out of the water and carried him up the bank, when, utterly exhausted and the excitement passed, they both half fell half dropped down, and lay for a minute almost as insensible as Carlton. Their first care on recovering, was to asoertain if Carlton was still alive. To their great joy, they found that his pulse, though very faint, was yet perceptibly beating. Their next care was to place him in as comfortable a position as they could, by making a couch of long grass and ferns for him. They then had a consulta tion as to what was best to be done. After a brief discussion, it was decided that Clara should go on to the nearest shepherd's hut, which was situate on the river at a ford, about four miles lower down. Arrived there, she would get the shepherd to ride in at once to the head station, and acquaint Townsend with what had passed, while she returned with the shepherd's wife, bringing with her whatever remedies could be procured at the hut. By the time she started the sun was just sinking below the western hori zon, but as it only wanted a few days of full moon, that orb gave abundance of light to en able her to find her way down. Left alone, Edith sat down by Oarlton's side, and half musingly watched the rushing treache rous stream, as it gleamed like frosted silver where the moonbeams fell upon its troubled waters. Her reverie would now and then be broken, by the crash of some tree or large branch on the opposite side, on which the fire was still visible, though every minnte getting more distant. Edith's position was lonely enough, and courageous as she was, she felt it so, to be seated by the side of one who had lately filled rather a larger share of her thoughts than she could quite give a reason for, and who perhaps might never come to life again, was try ing enough. The solitude of the spot also, and the stillness of the night, broken only by the murmur of the waters and the crackling of the needing fire, and rendered more marked by the vividness with which the occasional shriek of some night bird, or the melancholy howl of the dingo, would pierce through the air. Taking one of his hands in hers, she began, by way of employing herself, to chafe it gently between them, keeping, at the same time, a watoh on his face. While doing this she could not resist the temptation of smoothing off the hair from his forehead and lips, and this con cluded, she followed a kind of natural impulse by touching the latter with her own. Just as she had done so, to her surprise, she felt a shiver pass through Oarlton's frame, and feeling a little startled, she quickly withdrew her face from his. With intense interest, she watched him as he made several slight movements, and finally his eyelids slowly opened, and he looked up with a faint surprised expression. " Where am I ? What's all this ? Who are you ?" half murmured Carlton. " Don't you know ?" said Edith. " I'm Edith Townsend. You fell into the river after bring ing Clara and me over, and we pulled you out insensible. I'm so glad you have recovered, but don't talk just now." The events that had brought him there seemed gradually to pass through Carlton's mind, and he showed his understanding, of how he had been saved, by gently pressing Edith's hand in his own. Whether the stream in which Carlton had been immersed, possessed any of the properties ascribed to the fabled Lethe, it is difficult to say, but certain it is, that the image of Clara had become almost entirely effaced from his mind; and as Carlton looked dreamily upward through his half closed eyelids at the sweet face that was looking down so kindly on him, the idea occurred to him that there was no need of that image being replaced. Edith saw how very faint he still was, so stooping down she told him that he had better try and sleep until Clara came back with assistance. " Very well," said Carlton, faintly, �I'll do whatever youtellme; but sit by me please while I do." So slowly and faintly did he speak, that Edith was obliged to place her ear within a few inches of his lips. Carlton then fell asleep, with Edith's hand still held in his, and which, pos sibly from a wish not to disturb him, she did not withdraw. Not more than a couple of hours had elapsed since Clara's departure, when to Edith's surprise and pleasure, she heard the voice of her father shouting out to her. Withdrawing her hand from Carlton's, she walked away a few yards, and returned the call in as loud a voice as she could command. A minute or two after wards and her father wbb with her, accompanied by one of the stockmen and the shepherd be forementioned. It appeared that her father becoming uneasy at their absence, and noticing how strongly the bush fire was raging in the direction they had gone, had started with one of his stockmen to meet them; but not succeed ing in so doing, they had ridden on to the hut at the ford, conjecturing that that would be the most likely spot to come across them, or to gain some intelligence about them. They had ar rived there just after Clara had reached it, and learning what had happened from her, Towns end had started with the stockman and shep herd to Carlton's assistance, leaving Clara be hind at the hut. On ascertaining how weak Carlton was, Towns end determined to send the stockman back to the station to fetch some vehicle from thence for his removal next day, while Edith, the shep herd, and himself, stayed with him, making his position till then, as comfortable as they could. The night passed eventless, and the next day he was removed to the station house and put to bed. With a woman's quickness, Clara at once saw how matters were likely to go between Carlton 

 and her cousin, so partly from generosity, and partly to ayoid any mortification she might feel, at the sight of her cousin's success, she availed herself of an opportunity that offered at this time, and went to Sydney. Carlton's strong constitution, combined with Edith's unremitting care, soon brought him round again. Edith's attention to her patient was indeed most assiduous. Mr. Townsend con* sidered it was rather too much so, and told her that he thought she would worry Carl ton by bo much fuss. But Edith took the liberty of dif fering entirely from her father on this point, and gave ie as her opinion, that her constant attentions materially contributed to his restora tion to health, whioh opinion Carlton, on being appealed to, entirely concurred in. Our slight narrative may now be said to be concluded, but should any reader wish to know the future of Carlton's life, if he will only take the trouble of gobg to Gwalior, and making Mrs. Edith Carlton's acquaintance, she will doubtless enlighten him on the subject. As for her cousin Clara, after being for a season the belle of the town, she finally married an Eng lish gentleman of small means but good family, and enjoys quite as much happiness as is com patible with her nature.
