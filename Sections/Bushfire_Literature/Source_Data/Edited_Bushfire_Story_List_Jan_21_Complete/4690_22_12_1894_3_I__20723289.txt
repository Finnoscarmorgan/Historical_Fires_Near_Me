BROTHERS AGAIN. 

 By G. SPENCER BRIGGS. [WRITTEN FOR THE 'QUEENSLANDER' CHRISTMAS SUPPLEMENT.] CHAPTER I. 

 How I hated him�as it seemed to me then with an implacable, undying hatred. It had not been always so; many happy years we had spent together, my brother Rob and I 

 I, who was the eldest, scarcely remembered our father. He died while we were little children, and our recollections of him were mostly formed from what our mother told us as we two boys lay at her feet. He had not been a rich man; only just a small farmer. After his death our mother managed the farm until I was old enough to take some of the care from her shoulders. 

 Half-a-century spent amongst the Australian gum trees has not erased the picture of the old home from my mind. As I write it comes before me, clear and distinct�the old-fashioned farm hou�e with its many-gabled roof, its leaden framed windows with the diamond panes, and the rustic porch with the honeysuckle trained over it. In .imagination I can still wander down the garden, through the orchard, and over the fields and pasture land that stretches away to where the village church stands, with its ivy-covered steeple pointing upward from amidst the graves. How trimly those graves and the hawthorn hedge surrounding them were kept by the simple village folkl Our Australian churches have always seemed to me bare and desolate without the gravestones around them, marking the places where form�r worshippers are sleeping. As we came from ohurch we used to linger at our father's grave�my mother, Rob, and I�as other villagers did at the resting places of their dead, and always felt as if after doing so we were brought into closer touoh with the divine truths taught in the sacred building. Whilst my mother and I managed the farm together, Rob was apprenticed to a carpenter in the village, and after serving his apprenticeship he still w,orked with his old master as a journey man, but the farm was always his home. On, those happy, peaoeful nights we passed in the old home!�when Rob would come in- from his day's work with his basket of tools on his shoulder, and I, after seeing that all was snug out of doors, would meet him, while our mother, laying by her knitting, would join in our talk, or watch us as we played cribbage together. Our mother loved to see her boys happy, and we were happy; while children, inseparable in our play; when young men, companions in all our studies and labours; loving each other with all the simple, trusting love inherited from our mother. Afterwards, how I hated him. There was only one thing that could have happened to cause the love I bore him to change to s i.bitter a hatred. Mary�how often have I breathed that dear name lovingly, trustfully, hopefully ? Afterwards and how often have I uttered it despairingly, scornfully ? It would be absurd, I think, for an old bachelor, wrinkled and gray-haired, to attempt to depict an English village beauty. So 1 will only say that Mary was beautiful, from the curly, nut-brown har ray fingers have often burned to caress down to the neat J.ttle foot that to me seemed to consecrate the place it stood upon. Mary was a neighbouring farmer's daughter, and we loved each oth. r until Rob came between us. Bob, who might have had his choice of the whole village, coveted the girl who had all but promised to be my wife. Work had been slack in the village, and Rob had been away for some time travelling in the neighbouring counties wherever work was to be had. It was during his absence that Nary and I plighted our troth, and on hi* return I welcomed him back, telling him exultingly of our engage ment. He said little, and appeared weary with 

 his long tramp in search of work, before long his former master in the village offered him a job, and he gladly accepted it, taking up his old quarters at the farm. I watt Blow and unsuspicious, contented to dream in the fields of the paradise before me, un conscious that all the time Bob was secretly supplanting me in Mary's affection. At first when I used to meet them together I only laughed; in the security of my love 1 trusted him. At length the day came when I was ablo and free to ask Mary to complete our betrothal by becoming my wife. As I spoke to her I stooped to kiss her lips. ~ She shrank from me, and in an instant 1 saw it all�my brother had taken my place. It was then the demon hatred that abode with me for so many years entered my breast. In silence I heard her imploring cry for forgiveness, saw her fall at my feet in a burst of tears, and turned and left her. Maddened with rage I so ght out my brother Bob. I thought I could have killed him as, with a muttered curse, I threw myself upon him and bore him to the ground. My knee was upon his breast; my fingers were at his throat; he was at my mercy. I saw it. My hatred, however, had not yet come to its full strength, and I spared him. He rose to hii feet. For an instant his hand was uplifted as if to strike me, but letting it fall again he turned away. ' Ask her, Bob,' I cried hoarsely. ' Let her choose between us before night.' And Kob'a answer, sadly enough spoken, told me what I already knew too well�she had chosen. Befo- another weak had passed I had left the old home, and our mother's heart was nearly broken. I left Mary vainly entreating me to forgive her, parted from my brother in bitter anger, and with ever-increasing hatred for him in my breast I shipped for Australia. 

 Chapter IL After � long and weary voyage 1 reached Sydney, and at once pushed up country. Men were scarce in the colonies in those days, and I waw daily offered work at such wages as I should never have dreamed of. At length I hired myself as shepherd on an inland station, and I soon began to enjoy the wild solitary life, at the same time that I cursed the man whose treachery had banished me from home. 1 began to make money, and I determiued to Bivve it all. I wished to be come rich, and to know that Rob the while was doomed to struggle in poverty; to hear of his Wife and children destitute and starving, and then to be able to tell them of my wealth; to entice my brother to ask me for help, and to refuse it with a curse. Such was my dream of vengeance; the thought that sustained me year after year as the hatred deepened within me. There were no mail steamers in those days, and I had been nearly two years in Australia before 1 heard from home. At the end o! that time I 

 received a letter from my mother, enclosing one from Rob and a little note from Mary. Time had been when I should have covered that little note with kisses; now I read it coldly, an.l tearing it up cast the fragments fluttering to the wind. They were married and happy, and living with the mother on the farm. Mary hoped that the long absence from home and change of scene had banished her unworthy self from my mind, and that now I would write the words of forgiveness that 1 had refused to speak. Rob was confident that the lapse of time had enabled me to reflect with less bitterness on the past, and that now I should be generous enough to see that he had used no unfair means to win the girl I loved for his bride �that she had been perfectly free to choose betwixt us. 'He concluded his letter by asking me to forget the past, and to let him know that in spite of the ocean that rolled between us we were brothers still. 'Forget!' I muttered as I crushed his letter underfoot. 

 My mother's was a long letter, and I wept as I � read of her hopes and fears for me. After reading it L placed it among my most treasured papers� my bank receipts. My mother entreated me to complete the nappiness of the newly married husband and wif� by assuring them of my own. 1 answered her letter, telling her that I was well, happy, and making money, and that if she bo deiired she was at liberty to inform Rob and his wife of these facts. Then I waited�waited filteen long years for the news I hoped and craved for, day by day. At last it came�a latter from Rob. Our mother was dead. I read that, and laid the letter down. My mother had prepared me to hear of her death in the last letter I had received from her, bat the news came to me, nevertheless, as a blow. I had never ceased to love my gentle mother, and I devoted that day to her memory and looked no further into my brother's letter. I felt that the remainder of it would bring me joy, and I was not disappointed. It told of the hard times that had come upon Bob and Mary, bad seasons had been followed by poor crops, the little farm had been seized and sold, and Rob, with his wife and fami y, had taken !>assage to Sydney as Government immigrants. I aughed as I read the welcome news. 1 rejoiced at the thought of Rob being driven ont of house and home, forced to emigrate, and landing in Sydney penniless. It was the year of the great drought. Hun dreds of men were roaminu the bush unable to obtain emp'ojment, and I laughed as I thought of Rob joining their ranks, while his wife and children starved in Sydney. 

 I would hint to him, I thought, of ray wealth; tell him of the gold I had lying idle in the bank and bo draw him on to ask me for a loan, a small loan to keep his family from starvation, and then �oh, the joy to refuse it! For 1 was rich. For nearly twenty years I had been hoarding and saving for the day of triumph I had felt sure would come. 1 had always re ceived good wages, for I was considered one of the best shepherds in the district, and for some years past I had held a share in the flocks under my charge. I had been sent to new country, and was now shepherding my flock twenty miles away from the head station. I had no hutkeeper, as I had always preferred to live alone, and for weeks at a time I did not see a living soul; all these yearn living a solitary, dreary life, my sheep dog my only companion. Ever, night and day, I had silently brooded over my revenge with the hate growing stronger in my brea�t, and now the time of triumph was at hand. Once mom the ration carrier brought me out a letter from my brother. Bob had reached Sydney. Again I rejoiced as I read his letter by the fire light in my hut. He had left hit* wife and children in town, and had started on foot up the country to find me. That night I mused for houra by ray fire side, ever and again breaking out into wild laughter. Bob was in trouble, and wanting my help. At last, after long yean, my brother and I were to meet again, faoe to faoe. 

 Chapter 111. In my anxiety to become a rich man I had em ployed a great part of my time, while the sheep were contentedly feeding in the valleys, in ex ploring the surroundinghills and gullies prospect ing for gold. All my search, however, for the precious metal had hitherto been unsuccessful. In one of my later expeditions I had discovered a spring high up in the hills, the water issuing from a cleft rock, whence it fell, with a muaicai sound, into an almost perfectly round basin formed in the flat rooky floor beneath. The basin was barely 6ft. across, but was 10ft. or 12ft. in depth, and the water it contained was nearly on n level with the floor. Where it left the basin I could not discover, probably, I thought, through a hidden crevice beneath, where it would be im mediately Bucked up by the thirsty earth. The water was clear as crystal, and beautifully cool. I rejoiced at my discovery, for I knew that no white man had ever before penetrated to the Hpring and that the secret of its existence was mine only, and I guarded it jealously, as a miser guards his gold. Throughout the long dry winter the water had shown no sign of failing, and I now rejoiced to see also that the hot summer months had no effect upon it. All around me for hundreds of miles the country was dry, burnt up by the long drought. The creek, on the bank of which my hut wan built, wan for miles a mere dry bed of sand. Only one hole still contained a few inches of yellow, muddy water. When that was exhausted I should have to travel my flock into the head station. The manager had made arrangements to send me .out help for the purpose in the beginning of January unless the drought broke up before, and of that good fortune there was no sign. All through December the snn rose aud set in a cloudless sky, blazing down in fervid heat upon a thirsty, burnt-up earth. The few inches of water in the* hole lessened, the water got thicker day by day, and the few green patches of grass adjoining it turned brown and Rhrivelled up. The wind blew over the dusty plains in fiery blasts as from a furnace, carrying before it clouds of black ashes from the bush fires raging miles away. All round the horizen hung a low bank of smoke into which the sun sank at evening, not with purple and golden and crimson glories, but sullenly, a glowing red-hot ball. The panting earth opened and cracked and crumbled, and even the gum leaves began to wither and full. But all the time my spring in the mountains never failed; the clear, cool water in the basin kept its level, cease lessly renewed by th� beautiful tinkling stream falling into it from the cleft above. I used to approach the bubbling fountain as if it were a shrine ; and watching it I could realise how the old Romans would have peopled it with mysterious, unseen beings to be approached only with reverent invocation. I became�if there is an antithetical sect to the devotees of the sun god� a water worshipper. I would not allow my dog to lap at the pool, neither would I profane its 

 crystal depths by dipping a black billy can therein. A new bright pannikin was consecrated exclusively to its use which 1, thu lonely votary, kept scrupu lously polished. I built beside it a rude arbour of boughs, and in their shade T would ait for hours listening to the water welling up from its secret depths and ever falling iuto the basin at my feet. I was Ritting thus one day some three \\ve?ks after roceivia,'my brother's last letter. I knew that if he succeeded in reaching me 1 should see him before long, and 1 laughed as I thought of the journey he was taking, only to learn that the, hate 1 bore him had in nowise lessened. It was Christmas Day, and right overhead the sun was shining in all his merciless splendour; below me as I sat were the parched Dtauis, where the heated air quivered and trembled. My sheep were camped, with gasping mouths and heaving sides, in the shade of the timber at the diied-up creek. As 1 sut there 1 thought of all the many solitary Christinas Days I had passed, alono with my flock; thought of all the long, weary roun I of monotonous years I had lived, apavt from mv fellow-men, buried in the bush. And then 1 thought of all the happiness that might have been mine, all the joy that but for my brother would have shone into my life. 

 ' but for him,' I muttered, and the dropping water seemed to echo back the words, as it had done many times before�' but for him.' It was terribly hot, and I ay at full length in the shade drowsily watching the sparkling water as it fell, listening to it echoing my song of vengeance. Suddenly I fancied that 1 heard a groan, and I started up and gazed down the side of the moun tain. I was not mistaken. Staggering painfully up the steep, stony ridge I discerned a man coming towards ma, His head and feet were bare, and hie body was almost devoid of covering; what little clothing he had on was hanging from him in tatters. As I ran to meet him 1 saw that he must have been lost in the bush for many days. I cooeyed, and as I shouted he fell, and was lying on the ground without movement when I reached him. 1 stood at his side gazing at him as he lay there. His face and neck were blistered and blackened by the sun, and his sunken, bloodshot eye� gleamed at me strangely from under their stiffen ing lids. Hib lips were swollen and cracked, and as he tried to speak the cracks opened and bled. He sucked the red drops into his mouth, and as the moisture reached his tongue his lips parted. Stooping over him I heard him whisper my name, ' Will.' Then I laughed�loudly, wildly, triumphantly� for I knew he was my brother Rob. My revenge was at hand�the revenge I had waited for so many years. 

 Chapter IV. I had never aspired to such revenge as this. My highest hopes had never ripen beyond the thought of seeing Rob in trouble, to have the power to relieve him and to turn away obdurate; to behold him and his family dragging on a miserable exintenoe whilst I flaunted my gold before their eyes. With this end in view I had hoarded and saved, stintin-r myself of all but the bare necessaries of life, j.l mting ovjr every mite I added to my golden store. But how small and mean did my often contemplated revenge appear compared with the triumph I felt now. We two were utterly alone in the silence of the wild untrodden bush. Rub lay before! me ex hausted, helpless, dying�dying for want of a cup of water. And not two hundred yards away my spring was bubbling up from the cool depths, ever renewing the water in the crystal basin. I laughed loudly in my glee, and at the sound he looked at me with his fevered, glistening eyes, and from his blistered lips came the cry ' Water!' I laughed louder. ' Water!' I screamed. 'It is mine, Hob; mine, all mine.' He tried to crawl to me, and I saw that he had hurt himself when he fell. Then, as he sank back with a groan, I stooped and raisad him and dragged him up the ridge. Dragged him up to where he could see the water trickling from the rock and falling into the clear pool that flashed and sparkled inthe sunlight There I laid him down, and pointing towards the spring I shouted : ' Look, brother! See my spring�my beautiful cold water; mine, man, mine!' Once more he tried to rise, and again he sunk back groaning. �Morcy! Will,' he gasped, 'mercy! For the love of God�water 1 I ran to the spring, and then turning round I yelled back: 'Not a drop, Rob; not one drop. Do you remember how years ago you took my bride from me? Ha! see, I have another, another bride, Rob, my beautiful spring�and you shall never taste a drop of it.' I was beside myself in my delight, and I yelled and danced around the edge of the basin. I dipped my pannikin into the pool and drank the water in deep draughts as my brother gazed help lessly at me. I stooped and threw up pannikin after pannikin of water high over my head, and it fell around me in sparkling, flashing drops. 'Look, Rot,' I screamed, 'how beautiful it is.' 

 One drop fell on a twig near his head, where, it gleamed in the sunlight, and he writhed painfully 13wards it. and putting out hiu parched tongue he licked it off, as a dog licks the hand that strikes him. The. sun was shining with unabated fervour, and I left the heated rock and crept into the shelter of my bower. There I threw myself down beside the basin and listened for the falling water to take up its old refrain, the Bong of vengeance it had sung to me for years. I leaned over and gazed down into the limpid pool. The likeness of my face was reflected back from the clear depths, all warped and distorted with passion, and I laughed as 1 saw in what guise I mast appear to my brother as he lay without at my mercy. I peered through the bushes at him as he lay in the sun, and saw that he had thrown his arm across his face, to hide his eyes from the glaro of the sun�or from the sight of me. I laughed Boftly, and closed my eyes in the full enjoyment of my revenge. But in vain I listened, trying to catch amid the music of the water the burden of the song that day by day had nourished my dreams of vengeance. A new sound was ringing out now from the tinkling drops�l heard it vaguely�a sound 1 knew well, yet of which I could not recall the meaning. I turned over and gazed into the pool again, wondering, musing what the strange sound might mean. The indistinct music became softer, more distant, the echo of something I was slowly calling back to remembrance. Suddenly the glare of the sunlight seemed to pale, and the heated blast to change to a frosty breeze, and, as in a picture, I saw white flakes falling on the Burface of the water. They ceased, leaving the surface of the pool white and glitter ing, and Btanding amid the glitter I saw the old 

 SO NEAR, AND YET 30 FAR. 

 farmhouse where I was born. Even as I gazed it vanished anil the village church appeared in its place. I saw the well-remembered gables covered with snow, jind the villagers aHsemuling amid the Rnow-wrapped graves. One group were �nterin� the church, and with bated breath I watched them; for 1 Haw Kob walking by our mother's Hide and holding her hand, whilst 1 myself walked side by side with Kob and held his hand in mine. Then I knew what music the falling water was echong; music, whose melody had lifted me out of the desolate bush and carried me over thousands of leagues of ocean�that had rolled all the wasted years of manhood back, leaving me a boy again at my mother'R side, holding my brother's hand. Cleariarid distinct I now hear 1 ringing amid the tinkling,drops the merry Christmas ohimes. As I listened, spell-bound, the church vanished, and I was looking into our mother's room. A fire was burning brightly on the hearth and th� candles were lit. Rob and 1 were lying at our mother'R feet. We were singing. 1 heard our mother s voice, soft and low, and my own and Rob'R blending with it�unutterably sweet, and toned down by distance immeasurable, the sounds were wafted to my ears� While shepherds watched their flocks by night, All seated on the ground, The Angel of the Lord came down, And glory shone around. The scene swam before my eyes�a drop of water had fallen, disturbing the Burface of the pool, and the picture faded away. Again I hear! the clanging of the bells and again I saw us three to?ether, Rob and I grown sturdy boys home for the holidays, helping our mother with her Christmas cookery. We%were stoning plums, plucking the goose, and running here and there and everywhere, but always to gether�Rob and I. A dark shadow seemed to come over the water, and then, as through a mist, I saw a candle burning, and beside it Rob'B basket, with his tools packed in it, and while I gazed I made out the form of Rob standing alone. He was equipped for a journey, and I saw that he had boen weep ing. Presently he took a little card from his pocket, and for an instant I saw a vision of Mary's fair curls upon it as he raised it passionately to his lips ; then, with a trembling hand, he tore it in pieces and flung it away. And as he shouldered his workman's basket and passed out into the night I knew that he was leaving home for the first time�not to look for work �I understood it all now�but to crush out of his noble heart the love that had risen in it for my betrothed. Louder and yet louder rang the bells in my ears, and once u:ore I saw our little family group together. We were decorating the rooms with holly and mistletoe, laughing and singing as we worked. Presently another came amongst us�Mary, with her arms, full at the dark green leaves. I had just hung up a noble bunch of mistletoe, and as she came under it I sprang down and kissed her; then, glancing at Rob, I saw that his face was white and drawn. I left them together and ran out for Rome nails, and coming back saw that Mary had gone. Afterwards I saw Rob's eyes following me about wistfully, and ns I Baw us shaking hands that night I felt Rob's hand grasping mine firmly and lingcringly as if he were loth to let it go. I had never known the moaning of the pity in Rob's eyeb that night until I felt it now, borne to me with the sound of the bells in the water; and as the meaning broke full upon me I rose with a cry and dashed aside my screen of boughs. Rob was still lying where I had left him, with his arm across his eyes. Hastily catching up a pannikin of water I ran with it to him. Gently I iifted his arm and raised his head, holding the cool water to his lips. But they never opened to drink the draught that 1 had brought� too late. O heaven!�my vengeance was accomplished! Chapter V. For some moments I stood stunned, gazing down at my brother lying lifeless before me. I felt the hot blood surge and leap to my head, half blinding me, and filling my ears with a rushing, roaring sound. 'Cain, where is thy brother?' I fancied I heard the words thundered out of the mountain above me. On turning, however, I saw that the sound which had broken the stillness was occa sioned by a stone which had become dislodged and fallen with a loud splash into the basin. With a great horror coming over me I walked back to the pool, and stood watching the rings in the water caused by the falling stone. I won dered, cursing it the while, whether the dropping water would never cease to echo the far-away chimes, whether the Bound of the bells would mingle with it for ever. Through all the rushing roar in my brain I heard the clanging, clashing music, and through all the darkness that was coming over my eyes I saw another picture con jured up on the surface of the water. A room, poorly, even meanly, furnished, and in the centre of it a table spread with t:ie midday meal. There sat Mary�not as I had known her, but older, paler, careworn�with her children about her, the eldest a bright, intelligent boy, and near him a fair girl just budding into maidenhood; and three younger children clinging to their mother's skirts. As they took their places at the table I saw the girl's lips moving, and faintly, mysteriously, the words were borne to my ears, ' Poor father; this is the first Christmas Day that he has ever been away from us.' And then, loudly, deafeningly, crashing into my brain, came the mother's answer, ' Father is spending his Christmas Day with Uncle Will. Let us wish them a happy, joyful Christmas, children.' I turned away and cried out in agony, but the merciless water still echoed the merry chimes that were maddening me, drawing me back to gaze on the pool again. The same miserable room was pictured upon it still, but it was bare, for the furniture was all gone. Only one wretched bed remained in a corner, and I saw that the children were gathered round it, weeping; the boy grown stouter, and the girl taller, holding the younger ones by the hands. Then, as I saw the boy fling himself to the floor in a passionate burst of despair, while the girl, lifting eyes and hands to heaven, sank on to her knees, I held my hands before my eyes, for I knew that the children were taking their last look at their mother. Slowly, solemnly, sounded the bells amid the falling water now, and mingling with the hushed music I heard the cry of weeping babes. A soft darkness was creeping over the pool, in which I saw the bare room outlined. It was ni^ht, and the children had no light I saw them faintly as Jthey sat together on the floor. But even as I looked I saw the boy struggling in the strong grasp of a policeman and the little ones crowd round their Bister terrified an their brother was dragged from the room. I saw her left alone with them, soothing them, trying to still their piteous cries�cries for food, for a crust of bread. And than I saw her wrng h�r hands, with a bitter wad of despair. 1 Baw her kiss the little ones, 

 and leaving them in the dark room I saw her hurry out into tl�e lighted street, and 1 criei to heaven for mercy ; I dared look no longer. With the tears streaming from my eyes 1 turned from the pool. The chime� were still ringing Badly, but the tinkling music war growing fainter, dying away in indefinable distance. Suddenly it was drowned by hoarse, discordant cries, and I Raw that a flock of ciowb had alighted around the place where my brother lay. So had I often seen them assembling around the carcass of a sheep, and uttering a wild imprecation I rushed at them. They flew off, uttering their detestable cry, but all at once the harsh call changed, and I gazed at them bewildered. It seemed to me as if they were cooeeing to one another. The air was filled with the noise�' Cooee�cooee�cooo-e-e!' I rubbed my eyes, and looking up found that the bower was still over my head, while far away at the creek I heard loudly repeated nhouts. I rushed out, and called back. The nun was low on the smoky horizon, and down at the creek I saw a little party of horsemen emerge from the timber and begin to asc nd the hill. I glanced towards the placo where T had left Rob, and then, with a heart too full for utterance, I fell on my knees and silently thanked God that all that Christinas evening I had but been dreaming dream. I ran to meet the horsemen as they came towards me; the manager was leading, and as he cantered up he exclaimed: � A merry Christmas, Will. I meant to have sent you out some extras, but I knew that this infernal heat must have put the finish to your boghole, and left them until to-day. I have brought out a couple of men with me, and to-morrow we will make a start back with your she.ep.' Then, as the others came up, he continued, 'By the way, we have got a new chum here on the lookout for you. He Bays he is your brother.' And as Hob sprang from his horse and ran towards me I met him and fell upon his neck. � The other men stared. ' About time we caraa,' I heard the manager remark in a low tone. 'He was close up off his head.' 1 Good gracious, uncle, what horrible things you have been writing. Do all old shepherds go like that?' I lay down my pen and gather up my scattered manuscript, for I have been writing on the snug veranda of our homestead. Whether it has been the effect of the goose, or of the plum pudding, or the bottled Bass which Rob cooled by sinking in the ere k, taking down its bearings as he did so with considerable care�not so carefully, however, but that a bottle still remains at the bottom of the hole�whether it has been the effect of these good things or not I cannot say, but the fact is that immediately after dessert was cleared away Rob lay down and went to sleep. Mary�my brother's wife�disappeared somewhere in company with a book of fashion-plates, and my charming niece went with th� children to the garden, whilst mv nephew Willie, assisted by his brothers, went diving for the bottle. And I, being left to my own resources, mustered up writing materials and went into the shady veranda, of which I have remained in undisputed possession until disturbed in the�considering my gray hairs �irreverent manner above described. I wipe my pen, cork my ink bottle, and then my gaze rests on a little white hand that has made its appearance under my chin. I follow it up to where it joins a beautifully moulded arm thrown around my neck, and continuing my gaze upward along this charming; object I encounter at last a pair of saucy eyes looking down at me, while a pair of rosy lips repeat the objectionable observation: ' Do all old shepherds go like that?' 'Go like what?' I demand in an awful voice; but my sternness is met with a silvery laugh, and I surrender, yielding up my dignity, and allowing my beautiful niece, her arm resting on my shoulder, to lead me into tea. We are a merry party this Christmas Night, Rob, and Mary, and I, with my pretty nieces and rollicking nephews. After a while we drag the piano out into the veranda, and the children cluster round their mother, singing carols as she plays. As I listen to them the salt tears rise in my o'd eyes as again and ngain I thank God for the dream he once sent to me as I lay beside the crystal fountain �a dream that turned sordid hatred back into the old love; transmuted selfish, miserly greed into brothprliness; and changed a desolate, lonely life into�what? I look over to the happy group once more, and bless God. The merry evening comes to an end, and before separating for the night 1 go round and fill all the glasses. The children look at me expectantly, prepared to drink 'uncle's toast' uproariously, and Rob's eye catches mine as rais ing high my glass in a trembling hand. I give them my toa�t�only a line from a Bong Mary has been singing�' Chiming bells of long ago.' [The Bnd.J
