THE NOVELIST. THE PEACEMAKERS. By Kate Helen Weston. CHAPTER I. The a-parent cause of the trouble was a five-acre block of "round which formed part of Tom Freeman's selec tion, but other causes less apparent were at the root of the matter. It was a triangular piece of land, bord6red on one side by the creek, and cist off by the erratic meanderings ci the stream from the rest of his land. It adjoined his brother Jim's adjacent selection, offering an easy approach from the road to the gate of his graz. ing paddocks and affording a con venient corner in which to turn stock intended for an early market. More than once, in a fit of generous good-nature, Tom had remarked: "I must give you that bit of land, Jim; it's of more use to you'than , to me," and Jim had therefore begun to look upon the fertile little five-acre block as practically his own,. and many a crop of rape or mangolds weie grown upon it. with Tom's consent. . Non Jim, being 'the elder of the brothers by five years, was -married. He had chosen a wife noted as a cirl for her domestic qualities, and she had not disappointed him. She was an ex cellent house-wife and manager. It was Jim's boast that he could go away for Fays and leave everything in Mary's hands without a hitch occurring. The man or woman who enjoys a great reputation will tell you that it is not . the easiest thing in the world to live up to it, and Mary toiled strenuously that she might disapnoint nobody. They had one child, a little daughter, who was as the apple of their eye, and if Mary in the press of her household cares had little time for endearmenti, there was that upon her face, when she bent above the rosy sleoper at night which spoke volumes for her love for the child. Tom was still a 'achelor, and Mary, a matchmaker at heart, as most happily married womenare, invited all her unmarried sisters in turn to visit her and display their many good qualities for his benefit... The; were all splendid housekeepers and buxom, well-favoured girls- who would., not g,, empty-handed to 'their husbands. Tom liked them all equally, rode with them, bought them amnml presents, dis cussed the feeding of calves and the prospects of the season with deli?htful impartiality. When- the last oe had departed homeward without his having made any declaration of preference. Mary grew anxious, lest her vell-meant plans should fall to the ground. Soon after this, however. Tom made known his intention of building a xie'v house on the crest of the' little hill which overlooked the lower lands ofhis brother's property, andl.Mary again took heart. It could have but one meaning, she told Jim.. Tom intend .l to get married, and though she felt no certainty as to which of the girls he had set his mind upon. she felt sure it was one of them, as there was not a girl in the district who could hold a candle to them. .. Jim smoked his pipe complacently. Nothing would suit him better than for Tom to Marry just such anbther wife as Mary, and settle down beside him for life.. They had come to the place together and -worked 'side by side through good times and bad. He was glad there was to be no separation. Through the building -'eriod, Tom paid fivi?- visits to towin. as was only to be expected, and by and bye the house was finished, and Mary looked with satisfaction at the small new gable silhoueted against the )lue of the sky, and pictured Bessie or Sue established there, \\near eniough for sisterly inter course, and with such a good husband as Tom was sure to make. If they had not taken it so for grant ed Tom might have had the courage to tell .the truth, but in the face of their half-veiled insinuations and apparent .conviction as to his intentions, he was for once a coward. 'If there had only been Jim it would have been different but Mary--he hated to disappoint her. So he sneaked off on his last visit to town, and after a few days boldly wrote to say he was married. Mary veiled her disappointment as well as she could on receipt of the news, and Jim smoked arind said nothing, but when a week later Tom, in a state of blissful self-coonsciousness' and justifi able pride, \\brought his vounst bride home, he felt the change in their man nor towards him. Nothing was said words might 'havo relieved the situa tion, but a quiet resentment looked fiom Mary's eyes, and a sarcastic in. difference showed itself in Jim's. man hier towards him. . Jim was hurt by his brother's want of confidence in him, more than for Mary's disa'ppointmenit. and was ready to see a thousand'faults 'in.the city girl whom Toni'had married.. First of all she 'vas totally unlearned in the art'i deemed,'esiehtiaI for a -far mer's wife. What mattered. it that she was blue-eyed as. the "dawn; and sunny-haired as she was sunny-temper ed'? These thin?"; cointed. for nothing 

 wore there were" cowd to 'be.milked and bread to be baked.. , With regard to ,the forer, Tom was heard to remark' with'empbhasis that the cowyard was no place for womien- and that, too, in.face of the koiiwledge that Mlarv's help saved the expense of an extra boy to J?m. Jimn pointed this out to him', but Tomii ekressed the opinion that ethe w:ihen of: a household should not be exeted . to, do, all the saving and make up for deficient labour kept. The man should' shu~Ider.;the ad ditional burden, either. by. doing. the work himself, or economising in some "other direction :.:.As formnakin- bread, Kitty Freeman cohfessed' opeily? that she could not do it; and. that with a good baker only three ifiiles distant, she never intendedto t.r?'?: Having gone thirouh a course of .training at a good school.. of Domestic Economy, there wereox however, many things which Kitty could- do well. In extenuation of her fancied Shortcom ings, Tom explained that whatever Kitty could not- do' she ,could cook. making delightful littledishee out .,F nothing,-a few odds 'n'd'ends. an' there you are;' fod fit for a lord from what would otheriise have gone tpothe pigs. t. ."Fool cooking," Jim .callsd it coloured soups to. be drunk daintily from'a plate, grills a la this, and fricas sees a la that, instead of good sub stantial dinners of meat, with the ad dition of lion-hearted cabbages and potatoes boiled in-their jackets. It was vain for .Kit's husband to point out. that a laro" proportion of these heavy mdat meals would go to waste in a family. of two-they formed the regulation diet of farm life and were not to be superseded by such trivialities as Kit evolved. Later on Tom was. guilty of what Jim chose to consider a piece of reck less extravagance. (Two packing cases containing respectively a piano and a washing-machine were disgorged from a goods train.. upon the platform of the nearest railway station and duly con voyed to the new house on the ridge. They were installed in their respec tive, positions and Kit manipulated both with zest as occasion arose. One morning, however, when- Jim paid as unexpected visit to his brother's house. *he found Tom's brawny arm churning away at the washing-machine, wdli!? his other arm encircled t a trim little figure in a pink. cambric dress and a huge apron. Two faces, one tanned and sun-dried, the other pink and beautiful, were in close proximity. It was clearly a case of washing-day and kisses. Jim looked his disapproval, and Tomr murmured something about his having come up to the house for a spanner, and taking a few minutes' rest. Jim gave it as his opinion that' the man who sto-'ped home and did the washing, bought his wife a piiano 'and kept an extra boy to do her work, 'was on the high road to ruin, and, Tom's back stiffened, though he said' ibthing. Riding into the township in the after noon, the two'brotliere'met at the foot of the hill. Tom had paused to give his horse a drink at'the creek which formed the bouihdary to the little five-hcropgad 

 dock adjoining Jim's land, and Jim coming over the paddock on his grey mare stopped to adjust the primitive fastening. on the -.ate before joining his brother. Torn's manner was icy. Jim's words of the morning still rankled in his mind, and when Jim. the gate safe, came swinging down the slope to meet him, with the chance remark: "I must put a 'new gate there before long; in fact, I think I'll put a new fence all round the paddock,"-the words gave Tom an opportunity to vent his feeling. "You might wait till it belongs to you," he said coldly. "Seeing that Im on the high road to ruin, it would be unwise to part with a valuable asset. I'll keep the five acres if you don't mind." Jim's face flushed hotly. "Keep it, and be blowed to you," he said, and rode on ahead. After that the breach between them grew perceptibly wider. The five-acre block of land provided stimulus enough to keep the feud alive. Did Jim allow his stock to stray upon it, it was hunted off with threats of proceedings, which would never have been taken, and a notice with the in timation "No Thoroughfare" was nailed to a dead tree just inside the gate. Jim, through the lawyer in the town ship, sent a formal offer for the pur chase of the property under dispute, but Tom, now fairly aroused to antag onism, refused to sell- Every slightizig word which had been spoken of his young wife stung him into keener op position. In vain Kitty besought him to extend the olive branch of peace, and though. in most things he was as pax in her hands, in this he was obdurate, so there was nothine for it but patienpe, and Kitty had plenty. In the meantime she cultivated Mary's friendship assiduously, and what woman in the bush could refuse the friendship of another woman, whom Providence had placed so conveniently at hand ? Truth to tell. Kitty supplied a tonic to 'Mary's jaded mind. She was always fresh and sweet and beautiful, in touch with things outside the narrow circum ference of their lives, cognisant of the fashions: and deftly able to demon strate them with needle and scissors. Criticism of her city ways, which Mary reasoned could not possibly be right in the country, evoked nothin' - but the lift of a pair of delicate eyebrows and a roguish "leamn of the eye. She had learned to do things scientifically, she said, and Mary would find that her household would be just as well-manag. ed. fed and cared-for as if-she made a slave of herself. SWhen on rare occasions of leisure, Mary climbed the hill. by way of the cutting, leading little May by the hand, and came across Kitty. busy with her needlework in the shady verandah, she felt 'a-pang of jealousy when she re membered her own toilsome days and many unnoticed sacrifices. � The embrace of her young sister-in law's soft arms; the depths. of a basket chair with cushions at her back, and a fragrant cup of tea were stolen bits of dissipation for which Mary atoned by renewed efforts on her returni home. Little May soon learned to climb the hill by herself. Auntie Kit was always at liberty- to hear her baby confidences, and never bade her "sit down and be a good girl," cr "run away and play." She was always willing to romp, to be climbed over and kissed, to take walks "over the paggot" in search of mtush rooms or wildflowers, and by and bye it became difficult to keep the little feet within the boundary of home. It angered Jim when he came home so often and found the child away, en joying the dleasures of the enemy's camp. He reproached Mary for her half-heartedness. The quarrel was half hers and she was backing out, and Mary, who was the most peaceful crea ture on earth, was forced to accept at least a passive position of animosity, and, though she could not keep May's feet from straying, deny herself those festful half hours in Kitty's basket chair. So it came about that Kitty and the child were the only 'persons who were not directly concerned in the quarrel. The brothers, who had been noted for their good comradeship grew moody and quarrelsome. Jim expressed his intention of chucking the place and clearing out. Tom cultivated the five acre block as carefully as though it had been his role possession, and went about with a cloud on his brow which even Kitty could not kiss away, because he knew.she thought him in the wrong. and refused to take part in the foolish quarrel.. It was in vain that he' pointed out that her dignity demanded that he should punish Jim. Kitty was convine ed.that her dignity could take care of itself, without causing two brothers to quarrel over it, and by and bye the matter became a thing of public con ceen, and was discussed in the town ship with much spirit, the male com munity dividing itself into two fac tions. those who barracked for Jim. and those who considered that Tom had right on his side. CHAPTER II. The matter 'was brought to a climax by a disinterested party dropping a spark from a contemplative pipe over the fence of the five-acre paddock. It was a day of sudden heat, with an 

 awuuspucre unat quiverea in ane miten sity of the sun's rays. Overhead the sky was cloudlessly blue, and an op pressive stillness brooded over theland, which distilled a thousand aromatic fragrances from its scrublands. Kitty. was alone. Tom had gone to a cattle sale at a distance, the farm hands were away cutting scrub. She reflected that Mary would probably be alone also, for Jim would be at the sale as a matter, of course. The work of the day was finished; she would slip round the cutting and take Mary by surprise. She had scarcely reached the door when an ominous crackling sound, ac companied by the unmistakable smell of fire, reached her. Looking down the hill, at the foot of which lay the dis puted territory, a wreath of smoke. growing rapidly denser and rising threateningly against the blue of the sky. met her eye. The five-acre crop. already reaped and to be gathered on the morrow, was well alight. the flames leaping from one heap to' another, and travelling across the standing stubble by threads of quick and tremulous flame. The creek bubbling broadly over its shallow pebbly bed saved the house' on the hill from the threat of early dan ger. but there were fifty acres of cut scrub lying on Jim's land' and a forest of dead timber close at hand; ance the fire got into that it would sweep over Jim's property and probably traverse a hundred miles before it lost ground. Alone and unprotected the horrors of a threatened bush fire paralysed the girl's energies for a moment, then she coo-eed with might and main until the answering hills echoed with her voice. Meanwhile the insidious flames leapt onward, swallowing up everything that lay in their course. Already the sky was obscured, and even while she watched the scrub was on fire. With breathless haste she tore down the cutting and over the little bridge at the head of the creek near Jim's house. Mary met her with white lips and a new terror creeping into her eyes. "Where's May-isn't she with you?" she cried. "With me ? No! I haven't seen her to-day. I thought as it was so hot you had kept her home." "Oh, Kitty; what if she should be in the scrub?" cried ?Mary in an agony of apprehension, as a gust of hot angry air, gathering strength every moment. and carrying with it a cloud of sparks, enveloped them. "She's too thorough a little bush girl to go near the scrub," said Kitty, with assurance. IRer courage was returning now dan�er was coming nearer. "She is most liTely resting on one of the side tracks on the hill. If I hadn't been in such a hurry to get here, I might have seen or heard her." They clasped hands and hurried back ward, and, choking with the dense blanket of blinding smoke which grew nmore dense with every step. The roar ing as of a furnace had taken the place of the brooding stillness of the summer day. Here and there a column of mounting flame leaped upward from the gully, and marked the destruction 

 of some old forest giant. whose gaunt dead trunk and limbs offered easy con quest to the devouring monster. "Oh, my baby; my little May," moan ed Mary in her anguish, her trembling limbs taltering beneath her as they stumbled blindly on. "We shall find her, never fear," said Kitty bravely. "God will watch over her. She may be up at the house even now." Bravely they climbed their way up ward, and choking with.the dense volumes of smoke which enveloped everything, at last reached the house. The farm hands had been back in Kitty's absence, and were now fighting the fire at the point most vulnerable to their master's property, but there was no sign of the child. Then Mary's endurance gave way, and she fell like a log upon the doorstep, unconscious and incapable of further action. Leaving her where she lay, for every moment's delay was dangerous, Kitty set off alone, calling the little one by name. and searching over every likely spct in the yellow mirk for traces of her presnci. Then she bethought her self of a pool \\in a bend of the creek, where they had fished for blackfish the day before, and found on their return that they had left their fishing line and hooks behind them on the rocks. It was possible that the child, remember ing this, might have followed the course of the creek, intending to climb the hill in a direct line with the house. Kitty flew down the slope with wing ed feet, feeling her way, for sight was impossible. She reached the foot of the hill at last, and clambered up the course of the stream over. slippery-rock and boulder, following on the track of the fire. She dared not leave the bed of the creek, for on either side stood sheer heights of burning timber, which crack ed ominously. Once'or twice a limb of charred and burning wood fell close behind her and urged her on. The heat grew intoler able in the rarrow gully,, the atmos phere suffocating. Only the cool gurg ling waters which never ran dry, made progress possible. More than once her dress smouldered, her. hair was singed. She moistened them with the God-given waters, and pushed on. Often she fell against the cruel boulders,stupefied and only half conscious, her hands cut and bleeding, her skirts trailing in .the stream. She could not go much further. Suddenly a ,faint, familiar sound came to her out of the roar of the flames; it was the mewing of a kitten. and presently a forlorn, and singed little object emerged from the gloom, and came joyfully to meet her. - Kit uttered a joyful cry. "Trilby," she nalled, and the little thing came trotting on, rubbing itself against her with evident pleasure, then it turned and she followed it onward, losingsight of it every now and then in the yellow gloom. And presently another sound came to her; it was the choking desolate cry of a child, and it nerved her pulses afresh. "May, darling, where are you ?" she called, and pushed on more quickly. The heat grew more intense as she advanced; the fire was raging for twenty miles ahead of her. Already half Jim's fences were gone and the fate of his house was sealed unless additional help came quickly to the men who were trying to save it for him, but at least the child who represented the chief in terest in his life was safe. Kitty stumbled upon her presently, a frightened little black heap, huddled up in the creek, against the boulder from which they had carried on fishing operations the day before. It had proved some small protection from the showering sparks which had swept over her, and though her clothes were singed and she crouched half suffocated with smoke, some good angel had kept her little feet from wandering into the cer tain death which encompassed her. Kitty fell down beside her and they clasped their arms about one another. "Oh, Auntie Kit. you were such a long time coming," she sobbed from the embrace of Kit's sheltering arms. "Tx-il by ran away, and I was all alone by myself." "I came as soon as I could, darling," said Kitty, clasping the precious little form in her arms. "And now we must get away from here, girlie; as a burin ing tree close at hand creaked omin ously. Auntie will carry you." She lifted the half-suffocated child in her arms and essayed to refrace her steps. The creek ran sluggishly now, blocked by the fallen timber which diverted its course, its pools emptied themselves and were not refilled. Burn ing timber fell across it. Kit was forced to forsake its rugged bed. and stumbling on blindly came out by and bye upon an open space, over which the fire had long passed. She hardly knew where she was, but was only conscious that the burning trees stood further off, no longer menac ing her with their terrible creaking. Comparative safety was reached, and her feet would carry her no further. The child, overcome by the smoke. hung a deadweight in her arms, and presently they sank together in a heap on the blackened earth. There, later in the day. two men with agonised faces, found them, after a search which had sunk all minor dif ferences between them. A postponment of the sale had found the brothers on the homeward road in the early afternoonr, one riding a hun. 

 dred yards in advance of the other, and warned by that first threatening colunm of smoke they had hurried on, to find their worst fears realised. The fire had long before rot beyond the bounds of the beaters in some directions, in others valiant work was being done. Jim's house might yet be saved with their united efforts, but the women and child-where were they? Side by side the brothers galloped along the cutting, to find Mary. still unconscious on the doorstep, and Kitty and the child nowhere to be seen. When she could speak Mary's white lips gave them an inkling of the truth, and the men grasped hands and looked one another in the eyes. then, with no clue to guide them, pushed their way among the burning debris. seeking what they dreaded to find. lest an awful fate should have doubly bereft them. "I've been in the wrong. Jim," breathed Tom hoarsely. lyith the clasp of his-brothers hand on his. "The five acre paddock is yours whatever to-day may bring forth." "The wrong-doing has been mine," said Jim, with tears of physical pain and mental anguish coursing down his brown cheeks. "Kit is all you claim for her and more. I haven't been fair to Mary. She's had the lion's share of worry and work ever since she married me. and I was vexed because Kitty always had time to be pretty and sweet. I'll be different to Mary in the future, so help me God. "If she'd had more time to look after the little one to-day, she'd not have lost sight of her." On they stumbled, seeing not a yard before them. until suddenly they cross ed the creek bed at the division of the five-acre lot. Fence and gates were alike gone, and only the stumus of a few burnt out trees remained. The rest was scorched earth, and presently a little black heap, the sight of which froze the blood of the two men and palsied their limbs, met their aching sight. The next minute they were down or. their knees beside the prostrate forms. thanking God that life was there, and pressing warm lips to the cold stiff mouths, which presently responded to their caresses. The little naddock which had been the cause of dissension, had proved a haven of safety to the wanderers. Days and even weeks passed before the great fire of '98 was totally ex tinguished. Thousands of pounds' worth of property was destroyed, and thous ands of pounds' worth of labour in the extermination of scrub was effected. Losses were great, but gain eventuated, though many a man and woman went blindfolded through painful -days from the effect of the smoke and heat. But that passed in time, and one day Kitty led the way to the spot where she hadl found the little wanderer. The boulder against which the little child, had crouched for shelter rested now in the bed of the creek, and in its place lay the huge trunk of a fallen tree. shat tered and charred. Kitty did not know that it had fallen there less than five minutes after.she had borne the child from beneath its creaking limbs. She shuddered and clasped the little 

 one-afresh to her heart. Tom's arm was about her waist, Mlary's eyes were wet.as they met hers, and Jim stooped down and kissed her for the first time on the tremulous lips, over which an unkind word to him or his had never passed. So was settled the question relating to the five-acre paddock, which is now included in Jim's land. The two brothers once more enjoy the old com radeship. and though Kitty's duties have grown more onerous since the ad vent of a small son and daughter to the family circle, and smaller boys and Girls elbow Mary from her pride of place, Kitty remains sweet and beauti ful as of old, and still finds time for fishing excar.sions with the small fry. always acconpanieid by a descendant of "Trilbv." w'-ho trips purring down the hill at their sides, and keeps watch over the basket which holds their finny treasures.
