 CHAPTER XV. 

 On Saturday morning I got a notefromMr. Cotswold inviting me to stay at his home during the time I would be at Pottinger. On the same day the detective, Snndown, 

 took ins departure for the assize town, as I thought it might upset my plans if we pro ceeded thither together. I had convinced him of my ability to be of service to him by letting him scrutinise the land document, which I had placed for security, in the principal storekeeper's safe. On the Monday afternoon Ella Summers and Miss Gerty Almyr drove in to Nande- war in the sulky. Miss Gerty said that Mr. Cotswold had told her that he had asked me to stay with liim, and as it would be quieter and pleasanter for me to stop at his house than at, an hotel, she hoped I would accept liis invitation. Both girls seemed pleased when I said I would do so. Suspense and anxiety were beginning to leave their mark on- poor Ella. Her face was pale, and the dark rings round lier eyes told of hours which had been taken from sleep to be given to weepingi ' And yet the face was indescribably, sweet, although, alas, the sweetness was that of sorrow. The brave eyes that looked on me had not lost their light of faith. , ' The girl's spirit was still strong in the belief that the Judge of all the earth would do right, but the tender heart of the woman was being sorely- tried. What, I asked myself, is any man, even the best of men, that he should be loved w-ith a love like this? . More than ever did I feel that when a man has the love of a pure and innocent girl lavished upon him, his chief feeling should be one of great hum bleness. I could not resist the temptation to give her a little hope. : "Do not despair yet, Ella," I said, "I think there is a probability that things will come right after all." Before I knew what had happened she had taken my hand and kissed it, and her tears were raining upon it as -she exclaimed, "0, dear, good, clever Air. Rusden, I knew you would save him." We had some further talk, during which I learned that Air. Summers's rheumatism was worse and that he was confined to the house. Then, when I was bidding them good-bye, to go to the train, Aliss Gerty said, "I had almost forgotten, Aliss Sum mers told me to ask you if you had found her land paper.", "O, that's all' right," I replied, "let lier stew in her own juice "a while longer." " Miss Gerty's eyes twinkled. I think, she did not love the elder lady. "Then I am to say, 'Please, Alias Jane, Air. Rusden says you are to stew in your own juice a while longer;' " she said; speaking like a small child delivering a message. . "Exactly," I answered. And then I left them. ' ' Arriving at the station, as the train steamed into it, I saw Air. Lessing and Billy, the half-caste, getting out of the Currumbede buggy. I avoided them, how ever, and took my seat in a different car riage. ' When we reached Pottinger, I found Air. Cotswold'waiting to take me to his. houser-a . very, comfortable cottage in one of the best streets of the town. - The same night I saw Keith for a few minutes in- the prison. . -.1 did not wish to-let him know. what my plan. for his do-, fence was, "nnddie asked me: no questions, on the subject. His whole conversation was about Ella, and he whs eager to hear every thing that I could tell him of her. Now at last came the hour when the judge took his seat on the bench. Keith Hope was placed in the dock, and formally charged with the murder of Charles Sum mers. He pleaded not guilty. Then the names of 12 jurymen were called, and the prisoner at the bar was told that he could challenge them as they came to be sworn. Act ing on my advice, Keith did not object to any of them. Next, all the witnesses in the ease were ordered to leave the court, and the trial began. 'i'lie Crown prosecutor, a young, clean shaved, greyish faced man, adjusted his wig, gave his gown a hitch over his should ers, and, standing up, stated the case for the Crown. He told the jury that the de ceased, Charles Summers, had died from sustaining a fracture of the skull. That a weapon capable of producing this fracture had been found on the scene of the mur der; that this weapon, a whip handle; was the property of the accused, who at first denied that it belonged to liim. That the deceased, Charles Summers, had parted from two companions in the full enjoyment of health, and had been found by them an hour later lying dead, with the accused, Keith Hope, standing beside him. He re minded the jury that all this happened in a lonely spot in the busli, and ended by stating that the two men had had a quar rel the previous evening. Thc-n he pro ceeded to call his witnesses. Dr. Joseph Liston was first examined Ilis evidence was almost word for word the same as ho gave at the inquest. I was now in a dilemma. Could I have been certain that the trial would end quickly, so that Lessing would have no chance of hearing what I had asked the other witnesses, there was one question which I wished greatly to put to the doctor. The Crown prosecutor's examination of All Victorian rights in this story hare been purchased by the proprietors of " The Leader. 

 Liston was almost completed, when the! foreman of the jury announced that one of the members had taken suddenly ill. The result of this was that the sufferer had to be permitted to withdraw, bearing with him, I fear, the secret anathema of the judge, and a fresh jury had to be impan- nelled. As the trial lrad then to begin again, all this took a great deal of time. When Liston's re-examination was com pleted it was lunch time, and the court was adjourned for an hour. When it was opened once more Dr. Liston went again into the witness box, in order that I might cross-examine him. I had now made up my mind not to ask him the ques tion which would at once put Lessing on his guard. When he was sworn, 1 said, "Does it not strike you that Charles Sum mers's death was very sudden?" Liston had a quiet professional humor of his own, and answered, "Very sudden in deed," at which some of the jury, smiled. . Had I been a younger man I might have been disconcerted; as it was, having grown grey in the law courts, I joined in the smile. "Pardon me, doctor," I said; "I want a serious answer to a serious question. 1 asked you if you do not think the death was sudden ; in other words, .- do - you i not consider that death supervened very quickly after the man received his injury.?". /; Dr. Liston thought for a moment, "and then answered, "On the whole, I think I do. There have, however, been similar cases, but generally the patient survives for some hours longer." "Thank you," I said, "I have no other questions." Dr. Jones, of Nnndewar, was next ex amined; and. then Sergeant Quigley gave his evidence. I did not cross-examine either of them. It was now well on in the after noon, and the court was adjourned till the next morning. Once more the judge took his seat, the prisoner was placed in the doc-k, and the jury filed into their box. Then William Richards was called and sworn, and liis examination by the Crown prosecutor be gan. As his evidence was the same as he had given at the police court, I need not set it all down again in detail. He told how Charles Summers had parted from him on the day of the bush fire, and how. an liour later, he found him lying dead, with Keith Hope standing beside him. He related how lie found Hope's whip handle, and how Hope at first denied that it belonged to him. Finally, he described the quarrel the two men had had about the kangaroo dog. As I expected, all this made a great impression on the jury, and when the Crown prosecu tor sat down his face wore a look of satis faction. Things were indeed beginning to look black for the prisoner at the liar. It was now my turn to cross-examine the witness. I rose and said: "You have, stated that you and Air. Lessing tied up - your horses in the shade of a wilga. What, is ,the distance between it and the bibblo tree'be- ncath which the body of Charles Summers lay: -J'l'd reckon it about half a mile." 'When you were beating out';the-fire, did I yoy work in the direction of the- bibbel, or from it?" , J-. "I worked towards the bibbel." - - i "Had Charles Summers or -Mr; Lessing a whip on the day of the fire?"-- ' "I didn't see any." "Would- it have been possible for cither of "them to have had one about them with out your noticing it?" "No, sir; I think not." Then I came from -behind the table, full in view of liim and the jury, and I asked, " "Would you say now. that I had a whip?" .. "No." "And I suppose you have looked at me as particularly as you did at Cliarle3 Summers and Air. Lcssing?" . ' > ' "Yes." -v- "Well, you and the jury see you are mis taken, Billy," and I drew out the whip' I had bought from Nixon from the -leg of my trousers... / "Pardon me, Air. Rusden," the judge- in terposed. "but I fail-to perceive how your� "er� sleight of hand, admirable though it be, is going to assist us." , .You will see later on, your Honor. The Crown Prosecutor has had the advantage of me in being able to state his ease first. I am aware that I shall be allowed after wards, when the case for the Crown is com pleted. to address the jury. That, how ever, does not suit me, for this reason � the Crown witnesses are my witnesses. I agree with my learned friend that a terrible mur der has been perpetrated; I differ from him as to who did it. Before to-day's proceed ings are over I hope to. show the court the real murderer, and it may interest the gentlemen of the jury to know that the in strument with which the crime -was com mitted is at thiB minute in the breast pocket of my coat.'' When I said this I was delighted to see every man in the jury box stir on his seat. I had excited their curiosity, and was as sured of their alert attention to every point I made, till such time as I chose to show what was in my pocket. The judge's inter ruption had, in fact, given me the chance to foreshadow what would be my defence. Then, turning to Billy, I continued, "When you and Air. Lessing discovered the. body of Charles Summers, did you notice any marks on the ground as if there had been a struggle beneath the tree?" "Were there any tracks at all to which you drew Air. Hope's attention?" "Oh, ves; there were two that had been made by the heels of Alaster Charlie's boots, where he had been dragged from the edge of the fire to the foot of the tree." I paused, and looked significantly at the jurv, so that they might understand that this was one of the points I wished them to take note of. Then I continued� "You have no doubt in your own mind that Alaster Charles had been dragged along the ground?" . "The tracks showed it, sir. "How was the body lying when you came to it?" "On its back. "Did you notice anything peculiar about the shirt?" ."Nothing, except that it was all . drawn up, quite out of his trousers." Again I looked at the jury as I remarked, "That was the very thing I hoped you had noticed, Billy. Now, about the whip you told the Crown Prosecutor you found. Did you find it close to where the body was . 

 lyin|fj or some little distance off, nearer the "I found it close to the fire, sir." "In the direction from which you think Alaster Charles-had been dragged?"- "Yes." "The hat which you and Sergeant Quigley discovered a month later, whereabouts -was it lying?" "Near where I found the whip." Here the judge glared from under his wig at the half-caste. -,- "How can you possibly be sure of this?" ' "By the position of the sun, your wor ship, ynr Excellency, I mean. Both, the things were lying west of the tree, : and about the same distance from it. Any fool would have noticed it." The judge sat back nonplussed, and I was ileased to notice the impression which the lalf-caste's answer had made on the jury. One or two, who were townsmen, had been a bit restive when asked to believe that lie could be certain that Charles Summers's body had been dragged merely by looking at some tracks oil the ground, but they now seemed quite reassured as to the reliability of his evidence. I had now come to the great point of all which I wished to make, and for a moment I hesitated as to which would be: the best way to. get the exact truth -from the half- caste. My original intention had been to re mind him in awe-inspiring language that ho was on his oath, and give a lurid description of the retribution which would inevitably over take lnm should he be unlucky enough to perjure, himself � die might even lie held an accomplice ; of the murderer. ..After, a .very, anxious- moment; 'knowing .'how 1 much' de pended on my decision, "I made up my, "mind to take liim gently; lest I should terrify, him so much as to render him stupid. Accord- ingly, I spoke veiy quietly : when I said, You have told tlie 'Crown Prosecutor thn� Mr. Lessing was with you for the hour be fore the murder of Cliaries Summers?" Yes." "What were you doing?" "Beating out- the fire. ' 'Was there any smoke?" 'There was nothing hut smoke." . 'Was Air. Lessing close beside you help ing you to put out the fire all the time?" Ao fear; he knew too much. He was camping under a tree most of the time." When did lie leave voir to go to the shade?" "After we had been working a little while we both went to where the horses were tied, and had . a drink. Then I went hack -to the fire, and he stayed where he was." 'You left him there.. But how do. you know that he stayed there? Did you .turn round every now and then and have a look at him?" For some reason the lialf-caste grew angry. Probably- he -inherited the blnckfellow's ob jection to being, ."poked borack" at, and thinking I' was making fun at his expense, resented it. Anyhow, he answered, Have you no savey at all. How could I see him for the smoke?" - The judge and Crown Prosecutor smiled, but they .found out a minute later that I had made my point; "How long do you think Mr. Lessing was' resting under the tree? Alight he have been 10 minutes?"- "Yes." "Twenty minutes?" "Perhaps so." "A little over half an hour?' "I don't know." " "Now : he very Careful, Richards'."- - 1 roared, for by this time I liad . got all that I wanted, and it did not matterwhether he grew frightened or not.- "Remember, you are' on your oath, sir. Is it not true that for more than hnlf an -hour yon saw nothing of Lcssing, and he may have gone a quarter' of 'a mile away from you?" , � ' ; "L don't know." ; "Now, Richafds,''-T;snid, in a gentle voice; "think carefully for a moment, for' a great deal depends on your answer. Can you swear . that Air. Lessing was not actually out of your sight for perhaps more than half an hour?" - Billy remained thinking very carefully for a whole minute, while the court waited breathlessly for liis answer. I, meanwhile, forbearing to harass him in any. way. Then lie said, "I can't swear, boss. There may have been half an hour that I did not see him." Once more I looked at the jury, and then I said I -was done with- the witness. The Crown prosecutor did not re-examine him, and Billy stepped down from the box. (To be continued.) " '
