' ' I canp'ot aeceunt for it,' he answered the lake is too large to bp. the crater, of an pxtinct voleaoo. br aisything of that sort; but tbore's tbe fact, for I have roughly taken tbe levels. The water, in : the lake never varies in height, winter or glimmer, and is at least a foot higher tban hundreds of iquarp miles pf this eonntry,' ^ Doe's it ever rain bpre?' i^iked Buchanan.

Tbey now oan*e to a tudden deprep* ?ion, with p gr'adqsl fall to the surfaoe ot the plain of two or three feet, and tbey jysre immediately confronted with a vast stretcjj pf yellow loamy.sand upon whiob there grew a 'few �a'ge bushes'; bat further away to the north-west even tbeeo disappeared; and tbo hut afternoon son shone sweltering down, upon' a' vast spreading lindecapo of, desolation. The uouptaina which had ..been , seen with Hartley's field glais from', the eminence near' tlie lake, woro no longer visible. The trees which lined ibe. banks could be followed for tumo dUtanco to.tho left ; bnt due north it was a desert, tho first sight of which had much the same eiTeot upon the minds of tbo three travellers as does tho firaWight of the ocean,. The same melancholy, the same mystery, snd to sopio extent tbe same majesty ; but it was a dciirl-rtreeleifl, houseleis, fenco less, ; a veritable sea of solitude and death.' *! How far ii it acro�s P' a�ked Hartley breaking the �i]enco. j.f'No oiii knows,' replied Holdfpst. 'If dpyone'erpr explored it they have1 net rettirned again to tell.' 1 'But, 'said h*, 'Met u� ride along tbe! berd^ of the desert and I will show you 1 something.' It was most remarkable hot? ti^e clparly dii}nbd *? linp of demarcation, was con* i 'tinned for mUes, b�lween the grajs lend | and tho barren sandy 'loam.
