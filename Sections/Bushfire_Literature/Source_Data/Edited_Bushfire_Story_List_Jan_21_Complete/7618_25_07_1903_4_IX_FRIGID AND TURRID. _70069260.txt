We had a day in the seventies' when tIe north wind was such a scorcher that it was compariable to air issuing from the mouth of a blastI furnace, In this instance there were no bush fires. Some years back the hottest weather of the season was in the first week in March, and in the fifties, just asM1r. Michael Loenian's wheat on the fiat now owned by MAr. Wilfred Johnston was t coming into bloom, as a grain crop it was entirely ruined by a fiercely hot I norther, and had to. be cut for hay. However, setting all those things aside, we will speak in commercial lan guage in saying that as far as heat is concerned, it is entirely a home produet. cold weather, with its accompaniments of rain, an import. No?w, from the general contour of our ciuntinent, wilth'its' ni'iineiise areas of tre loed, deadilevol?siirface, lakes few in itnutber, rivers flowing widely apart, and inotintaisis'itot of sufficienit altitiide to exercise more than a local influlelnce, it stands to- reason that tho universal-dis tribution of rain over this continent is a mere question of chalncd. If we had inmerous mountain chairis 'reaolhing up to 'the snow line like tho' Australian Alps, then climato!ogy wiitld be the p-:. posite to lwhat it is, and .in place :of our. disaitrous droughts "we shoinlij bde otn plaining of the excess of moisture.' ": It should be clear. to every person Sa'dnhlo of think'ng that theloiilmnot total c absence of clond-arrestors,'?,liose duty is the condensation of mninuten particles of vapour into rain is. the real cause.of the e droughts'in Australasia. As it is, we are indebted for the bonn of rain to. oceanic evaporation, which, according to the celebrated Commanuder Manry, of thei United States Navy, pro:eeods at tthe 0 rate of 15 perpendicular feet perannunm. - An imnmoste volume of this vapour,' tinder the process of condensation no, doubt falls into the sea, blit an enormn a ous bulk deseends on lands situated in' equatorial regions. On this heal the great rise of the Nile is an illustration, but there are several instances outside of the Mosaic record showing that the rainfall on the watershed'of thl, great Egyptian River has its glorious uncertainties. The gen eorlity of renders are unaware of the fact that the once tmigh'y land of the Phar onlas is a rainless country, hence it is wholly dependent upon a river whose rain catchments are situated many hrui drleds of tmiles away. Nile, we grasp two most important faels -to wit, the maximum and the mini nmum driftage of rainclouds to that part of equatorial Africa from which the river derives its sourcee. ' When there is a high Nile we may assume that the vast volume of vapour has not been deflected from its track to its natural point of I condensation into rain. At thle same - tie we we have no data to prove whether the rain comes fronri one direction, or whetlher those raieclouds come fromt all 5 points of the compass and junction on the highlands of Africa to fall in abso lute torrents. Of course all this is merely conjectnr. al, still I' hold on to the theory of de fliction, because when there is a low Nile an enormous volume of vapour must be diverted to be condensed into rain to fall on some other portion of the globe. No doubt evaporration, taken as one R grand whole, must be uniform through out, but at the same time the drift? of vaponr must be exceedingly erratic, and th;,t is the reason why we have too much , or too little rain. S All' this is mere theory, yet theory in ,l one age often becomes a realisation in tr in another, blimt as scientific speculation 1, is very dry reading to the generality of d people, we will go back to the opening of this chapter. Those who assert that colder weather I d mote of it prevails now than in for mer times, overlook the all-important I. fact that having been bred to the clim s ate they have become more sensitive to low temperatures. Even those who catnie from the colder parts of the Brit I ish Isles, in the course of years, tlhrough the chantge ii their systems will com Splain of the winters here. Last Spring, in droving sheep to Micklhham, the writer happened on an Englishman who lhad gone back to Bri tain. The reason why he returned to this state was because there was not half enough suinshine in his native land.

Mr. Jamieson was first mate, anid my 1 father intended to get other details from him, but he was defeatcd in that oibject I owing to .latniteson disposing of his lei sure in wining w;th the skipper.

As this narrative proceeds, :my ï¿½read ers will perceive that if the old' medico was tinot exactly off his cllhump, at the' least lihe was eccentric.

"At that time of slow voyogiug, as we ior'e without those refinem(lents which adorn the present age, practical joking would I.e resorted to kill monotony. The doctor, with his peculiar tendencies, was eividently regardehd as the nime, fit person on I,,nrd to work upon, therefore' the ladies in the ct.!dy-coaepired to take a rise out of hinm. ' The caddy in the present era is deno Sminated the saloon, but we were in the second cabin, for if we could have afl e orded it, the mater, owing to her very deficient education, was not qualified to associato wit h tladies. :Whether Mr. Hill was in the caddy conspiring, or whether the ladies talklod him over to act as their agent cannot he Sproved.' Likely enough lie was up to the very neck in it trout the first, and judging by the n'manner in which the uschenme wa3 earri.,d into execution, that ' part of the contract doiubtless originated ' in his msclhievons brain.. Evidently there was nothing ton hot or too heavy for the' Hlampshire hog ' to tundertake, iant it was said that before coming out, he hail to cut"to Jamnica to avoid com iig into contact with the law for some wild pranuk. Tihe report was that a per Ssn Ita I erected swell 'entrance gates of timber, and the ' IIampshire hog,' as the men of- that county are termed, am used or revenged himself in freo'y oper ating on the woodwork with his shot gun. However, Mr. Hill, who was a man of good family and had been mate of a ship,; having annexed a tar pot with its brush, invadled the old medico's cabin, r and gave Norris' best suit of broadcloth a niost liberal dose of the Stockholmn. ' This procedure, as a wantonly cruel act, was infinitely worse thtan the Perrys' fire-branding of Hunter ina drunken r frolic nt Dandenong. They had some 'little cxcuse, but in the case' of Norris 3 there was none, and if his eccentricity did aR'tuily amoimt to sillinss, that was all the titre reason why they should s not have inatif: him the victim of a'bii'r barons practical joke. I Front what ised to hbe related, the docto'r;when he discovered that his han a: biliments:wcro'totally ruined, instead of Ce boiling .over with indignatinti, tonuse f what seems to be an elegarnt word, pre h lected beforo' the :people of the euddy. fBy all accounts he denouncel the perpo -t ittor of the mischief in forcible hat t reline I language, and as men of his bias are very prone to harp upon one string, lie would sermonise over the affair t, an indefinite extent. This ewas where the real fun came in, and if Hill was in the I cucldy, as I have reason to stlppose lie Swas.' in all probability it would b' high old sport to him to hear Y:orris 'talk of 1 what lie might do if hlie could locate the - dlestroyer of his garments. S III course of time. thle oil mant's sol emn prosingse, if they did not taper offil, would begin to grow, flat, lihence the femtalo e!ement, to start tile pot boiling atfreslt, split' upon thIe primni culprit. It Swould appear that Norris, being enablo4 to litate Hill, soeught a private interview Swith that indiidnidl,; 'andddemand.led five I guineas as compensation for the irrepar S'able damage dolnetto hie'outward adorn ments, or, if Hill would not pay, he looked to him to afford him the satisfac tion of a gentleman.

'Tlhe tarbrislsh transactinr would be lknown all over the ship, but it is very 

 doubtful if any cf the t.assengcrs knew that slits were likely to be exchanged, or if they thtought so, the whole thing would appear too absurd in their eyes to eventuate ini a real fight. They would natuirally conclude that a young fellow with all- his wits about him would never dreamn of levelling a gun at an older man, who, in spite of his eccentricities, when it camo to the pinch displayed high courage blended with shrewdlness in business matters. Anyhow, if Hill had arranged to do battle on landing, the most profound secrecy between the prin cipals must have been observed, because none (except it might be Mr. Edward Theodore Flintolf) knew what was likely' to take place. The evidence points to the conolusion that heo knew absolutely nothing -abdut arrangements until ha dania ashore with Hill to spend the night in Melbourne. Anenit the duello not being bound by nany lromise, I quote from ' The Aus tialian Journal's' " Remenisrences of Early Victoria.' Amongst aueiont items is: that the late Mr. Peter Snodgrass had a meeting wsith Mr., afterwards Sir Redmond Barry. Pistols were used, but neither of the combatants sustained any damage. Mr Batey came. ashore the same even ing, and tied up for tihe night at the Lamb Inn, kept by Phillip Anderson.r HIis tvo shipmates would quarter some where else.
