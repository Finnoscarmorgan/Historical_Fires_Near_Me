 THE MINGALEE. 

 CHAPTER XVIII.-(Continued.) 

 By "BULLOO." 

 Pompey made the heartiest meal being followed closely by Ah Choo. Harry con-<*> sumed about a quarter of a pound, but Jim fared badly, the third mouthful 

 causing him to retch violently, and be rould swallow no more. The remain' � der of the fish was cut into thin slices and spread out to dry, Harry remarking "It'll be better eating when it has been dried." The second half panniean of water wafl consumed at noon, and shortly after wards a slight wind came-from the east moderating, the sun's rays, and causing hope to spring up in their breasts, for if it continued and did not blow too bard they might reach land again. To make the most of it they held their shirts extended to catch the breeze, taking turns, except Pompey, at steering. The wind died away at sunset and there seemed no prospect of a dew falling, for a light haie obscured the stars and they hecame depressed, for the current may. have been wiping off all tbey had gained by the breete, as far as tbey knew. The night, however, was beautifully cool, """ x although suffering severely from thirst they 4tlt fresher, which was as well, for about midnight R mishap oc curred calculated to try their pluck to the utmost. Pompey and Ji m were awake and watching a school of porpoises at piny a lew yards away. "I hope they wont bunt into us," re marked Jim, "they might knock a hole in .us. veryNO q uic a krieye:-' 8 "" "*'' "they haY� ?h'f hL^ t>rdB w*r* BC�rcely uttered when the boat wns struck a violent blow un derneath nearly upsetting ta�n, and the BPa poured in several gallons. ''Hullo, whaflor." cried Harry and Ah Choo respectively, an.l the Chinaman looXe.l so queer that Jim burst into a latigti. ..i' hll1 r'" p*aln remarked Ah Choo, >ou bailee monkee possum." ? fj Wao It?" demanded Harry,."Did we strike a rock, or are you up to your tiJCKs again ?" ? ' No/ replied Jim, "We got into n .school of porpoises and one or more of tbfm bumped us." "They bumped the water, too, I ex pect," snid Harry gravely, "I'll take a *lp to make sure." ' "I was nfraid so," bo continued, "the fi�a water went right iuto the panniean. Taste it. yourselves." "3alt as the sea," cried Jim, ejeetin? a mouthful. "Daeh it. dash it, dash it ' be yelled anjrlly, hurling the pannlcau overboard. "What right h*ve we to b� tortured this way ? What crimes have we committed ? who have we wronged ? Why, haven't we let the niggers off when we could have killed more of them ? Perhaps we're he ing puninbrd for being such merciful fools." "Hush," exclaimed Harry. "Don't talk like that. Let us bear whatever comes to vs like Britains. Remember an Bng liahman can always hahj? on for anotuur t<n minutes." Jim did not speak again, I>ut his lips were iii<htlv comprised, and his ryes held an an�ry glitter. Their loss was s o groat that sleep was battwhed. �nd they, sat gloomily waiting fcr daybreak. . . A��in the easterly breeze sprang up and moderated their sufferings, bnt the wnnt of water had began to tell upon them. The l��t of the poonba, not at aU in- Palatable when dried, had been con.nmel and ro more had been caught, in va!r thiy trawled the white rag. It attr;icrcl nothing ; �nd the evening of the tliir 1 day found them weakening rapidly. The easterly favoured them continuing aU night, and having to hold tbelr shirts extended to receive tfte fall force of it helped to exhaust them still further so that at toon next day Jim collapse.', dropping his iliirt overboard and nearly following ii. � Both were saved, and bU mat s* faces became graver ana more Uag ��rd, for they realined it was the begin ning of tbe end. Harry uttered a deep sob as be rested the lad's head against his knee and bath ed it with the fresh sea water, reviving him, for he had been only, s-ml-uncon . sctous. .... ... Just as the sun was Betting it lighted up tbe pinnacle of a- mntiatain. Ah Cho o � saw it first, but hesitated to speak until he was surer,, and, he opened his mouth to i^nnounte; 'his. .discovery wbea Harry cried: T T ? "Land, Jim, land, old boy. Buck up, old chap, we'll be ashore to-morrow and eating roast duck." ' : ~ <J< . . Jim smiled in a eickly manner, but raid nothing. He fe'.t it did not mat ter ; -he was so .tired, and his throat was *o dry. Pompey was unable to hold up the sub stitute for a sail more than a few min utes at a time next, day collapsing in the afternoon, and Jim had become de lirious giving his brother full occupation in preventing him from going overboard, bo that Ah Choo had to hold the shirt up most of the time, making no sign of bis great weariness. N*o one will ever know the agony, the i fellow, wooden god worshipping bar barian suffered Kitting in M�e bows with 

 arms extended to catch the freshening I'rwtt until tbey became numbed. In his anxious care of .Jim, Harry had entirely forgotten the length of time the Chinaman had been holding the shirt, and it was not until he observed his drawn features he remembered, when he told him to watch Jim and took bis pla"ce. But Harry had reached the end of his tether and in a quarter of an hour was huddled up in the bows with the shirt lying across his breast. Ah Choo observing him subside put his hand inside his own shirt, and producing the Jittlo god spat on it, bangeA.it on the tunnel and threw it overboard. A few minutes later he laid himself across Ihe legs of the restless Jim, and short ly there. was no sound except the splash of the little waves against the boat, for the Chinaman was in a stupor of ex haustion and the others were unconsci ous. But the easterly breese kept blow ing aU through the night, cooling their fevered blood and tearing them towards the shore. "Whaffor. whaffor," muttered Ah Choo. Lcmme Eleepee." But the disturber persisted in jolting nim, and opening his eyes be saw the branch of a tree hanging over the boat which was bumping near its root. "iVo bailee goo," he muttered, closing his eyes, for he thought be was dreaming, l-ot Harry's voice fell on his ear, "Than* Bocon:s�s we're saved, Jim, JJm, old chap here's the land." But Jim maile no response, lying mo tionler.s, though Fompey stirred uneasily thaw-in* he wes <jnill alive. Harry, too weak to stand up in the Jumping Vo.it, crawled over to his brother and placed his hand over his heart to Bit 

 If life remained, while the Chinaman;' tnmblln* over the side, scrambled through the mangroves \\ a searrb of water, carry ing the remaining panatcan. The atoll on which they grounded was only a� fow acim in extent having no watcrholrs, but there wan a sandy hillock a few yards from the water's edge and burrewln* down with hi* hands and knife he founJ'tbe life giving liquid. It was several mtautts before he had secured suf ficient to moderate hi* saaVrings, and tbtn took the vessel full to his mates. Harrr ragetly seired it, and raising Jim's hend ponred a litile into his mouth which Ah Choo forced open. At first th� water would not jro down, but presently a few drops trickled into his gullet, and then half a I�int was swallowed. ''That'll do," said Ah Choo, "too muchfe' no goo. you dlink ndW7*? H^rry knew it would be fatal to give h?� brother much''more, and restraining his own alT9O2t maddening desire to swallow the remainder, attended to Pompey. The black lad was onconsclous, but not fey* rny'n�an3' terrfr of Me, iand responded quickly to Harry's efforts, in a few min utes' �peeing, his eyes and clutching the pannican, which, however, was empty. Hnrry had now tome to the end of his endurance, and it. occupied Ah Ohoo at Icest half an boar before be brought him out of the fainting fit into which he had fallen. When �ie had sufficiently rccotercd he and Ah Choo assisted Pompey ashore, placing him out of sight of the veil, aad then returned for Jim, whom they placed in the shadiest spot they could find. The i boat was bawled up as far as their little strength would allow, and rwas safe for the lime being, as the tide waR falling. 

 but when it rose they pulled her further up. There were no animals on the island, but Ah Ohoo got a fishing line out and baiting with crab sought for food in this direction, leaving Harry to administer water in small quantities to the sick lads. Before the Chinaman had succeeds in catching a fish Pompey was well enough to light a fire with twr. dry sticks, and Jim was sleeping peacefully. When Ah Choo had caught a quantity of bream they were placed on the coalu and roasted, each thinking what a hearty meal he -would make, but to their intense surprise after they had eaten a few mouthfuls they Buffered from such a feel ing of distension they desisted. Ah Choo made some soup with fish for Jim in the panniean, and when he woke managed to get him to swallow a few mouthfuls. The lad was watched al ternately by him and Harry, who be fore morning had administered the whole, doing him a.great deal of good. Fom pey did not look much the worse for vear in the. morning, when the three made a substantial meal. Jim came to his senses about ir.ilJay, though woefully weak, being unable to sit up unassisted ; but repeated dc;~�:? of fi�h soup made � rapid inipri/emeut, though he was not able to s'.and alone until the following day. Meanwhile the others busied tVnr.ilves in making two pairs of paddles f; -n. the stunted trees growing on the islu:i.l. It was by no means an easy matter for the. little trees were not straight in the grain, but Ah Choo's ingenuity flrplly overcame all difficulties and a useful but rough lot were made. Our friends in � spite of their misfor tune* bad been meted a considerable 

 amount of good luck, for they had drltt frt through a channel o! the reef uncon sciously, avoiding the terrible �oral and grounding on the only islet in sight, the mainland being still ten miles distant. Th� favouring breese bad wiafted them close past the island and an eddy caused by a submerged rock put ber ashore in a ?afe place. A Borry-looking youth was Jim when he was assisted into the boat, but his spirit was not dead, and he could not re slat bobbing Ah Choo's no�e on the gun wale as he gave his back to the lad for a support. "You all li you bailee monkee possum, you no dead by jolly long eaalkee, my word/ exclaimed the victim rubfeing the injured organ. Although the fish' diet had done won ders in restoring their vitality they were not -by any means in their usual strength, and it took the greater part of the day to make the mainland, arriving at the mouth of a river. Jim's eyes glistened as he observed the bold rocky headland at one side, and a deep fringe of mangroves on the other side of the broad stream. There was no occasion for Harry to inquire if he would like to gt� ashore ; both he and the others longed for it. They had bad enough of the ocean for a time, and were hungering for a fair rxtrnt of terra nrma and the food they conid obtain upon It. There was the usual bar. but the wind was behind them, and the young flood just running, so it was negotiated with out difficulty and they swept up the Ktreaa. They pulled a full ail* before (27> 

 they found a satisfactory landing place, when the boat was hauled up on a red graveity beach where a small creek emptied itself into the larger stream. "Thie is the thing for me," cried Jim. "Nothing like old mother earth," as he Tanked over the side. Unfortunately be was weaker than be thought, an�l bis toe catching he fell full length on the gravel, his nose coming in contact with a large pebble, which caused It to bleed. His mutes had run the' boat up before he could land, and he wished to show he was no longer an invalid. "Blow it," he exclaimed. "I've got more of mother earth than I wanted." "Better blow your nose," said Harry, as Pompty emitted a guffaw, and Ah Choo held up a piece of paper bark for him to perform the operation with. "I thought Letter of you, Sneeier," he paid in lachrymose tone�, "I never poke fun at you when you're in trouble." " No goo. old man, you don't catchee me," replied the Chinaman. "You raakee plentee tlu'oble long me, my c'loniai. You say blow it, well, you blow it. I ao blow it. You plentee gammon." ' Pompey wan sent to �Py round for any signs of black*, Jim took the fishing lines, while Ah Choo kept guard with the revolver, anrl Marry went up the creek in quest of kangaroo or emu. The latter was fortunate, for in less then n mile he came across three kan jrtv.xs. anrt the report of his rifle reached llwcinti). Shortly afterwards he appeared with tfc> Mndqiierters of a fine fat doe, and Kiior.l..- l.road rteakc were sizzling on the coal?. As if th.> aroma had reached Pompey he reappeared just as they were cooked, and without waiting to make his report matched a smoking piece off the fire and began to eat it ravenously. "No blacks about here," said Harry, "or he would have said something about CHAPTER XlX.�Bill Noggins Again. . A spirit of Jollity pervaded the camp for although Jim was very weak the re turn to his accustomed perfect health was assured, while the sensation of hav ing solid earth under their feet was magnetising after the buffeting they had received from the ocean. With a piece of kangaroo meat in one hand and his sheath knife in the other Jim commenced a vigorous interpretation of the can-can pirouetting and kicking high around the fire. Passing behind Ah Choo he could not resist the temptation of kicking ovrr his bend aa he sat on � log eating his Bupper, but unfortu nately the Cblr.aman . rose at the same moment, and the. lad's foot caught him on the side of the jaw near ly knocking him down and sending the piece of meat into the fire. "Whaflor !" he cried furiously making a blow at him with his knife. The weapon just missed Jim's breast, for he had nearly fallen, and was staggering back wards. He fell on his back and flung his legs up to protect himself from fur ther attack, but Ah Choo with a low cry of "Jim, Jim, oh Jim, you bailee possum," flung bis knife on the ground and ran into the bush. The lad's horrified expression at bis narrow escape from death prevented Harry from giving him a serious repri mand, but he could not refrain from say ing, "Your idiocy will cost you dearly yet. Ah Cboo would never have for given himself if be had stabbed you. You.had better go after him and express regret for having kicked him accilent ally." Jim found him sitting against a tree with hi* face in his hands looking the picture of misery. "Now then,. Sneeier, old chap." he said, "You needn't look so down in tha mouth. I didn't mean to touch you, you know, but you row just as I was flourishing my clumsy hoof over your head. It would have* served me jolly well right if you had cut me a bit. I can't b*lp being a Jolly ass you know.. Come on back, old felloin, I'm very sorry." "No goo, no goo," replied Ah Choo withont raising bis head, "I nearly killed you, Jim." "Welt, look here, old man, I'm as hun gry as a starving dingo, and dash my buttons if I eat a scrap of supper if you don't come back with me at once. Harry sent me for you." "As if the last words were what he had been looking for the Chinaman rose immediately, and they walked back to the camp together. Nothing more was said on the matter, and the meal was concluded peacefully, but the excitement together with his gymnastics had proved too much for Jim, and there win not much of the monkey about him a? he lay on a heap of grass in a semi-prostrate condition. "We. shall have to spell a fsw days ; that toy is not fit to face rough weather yet," said Harry regarding him anxious ly. "Time is no great object just now, and we'll feel all the more comfortable knowing he is able to face anything that comes along." Pompey received the statement with considerable satisfaction. His experience of deep water cruising bad not been en couraging, and he would h*re been still better pleased to iearn tbe boat was to be abandoned, and the journey completed on foot. Ah Choo, however, would tare bata more satisfied if they were 

 going on in the morning. He did not /ear the sea, and he had a dread o( the blacks. He could face a storm, know ing if any one would survive it he could, but the disconcerting habit the blacks bad ol concealing themselves be hind even a small bush and pouncing out upon an unsuspecting victim kept him in a nervous and unhappy state of mind. "Boat welly goo," he exclaimed, "no* more big storme tome up for this moon. Too much walkee no goo, Jim knock up dlekly. I think get away tomollow mornin'. Black fella com� up dleklv, ray c'lonial." *' "We can keep guard or keep a sharp lookout," replied Harry, "You needn't be alarmed, we're not going to walk the rest of the Journey. The boats all li, as you say, but we, especially Jim, want a spell and two or three days won't do us any barm." Pompey had listened eagerly to the ar gument, and was hoping to hear the bo�t^ would be abandoned, so that be was di��^ appointed, and the idea of deserting his mates flashed through his mind. It was only a flash though, for he knew he wou.d be kiUed on sight if he encounter* *d any blacks by himself, so resigning the future to itself he lay back on his grassy hipper and was soon lost to his surroundings. No special watch was kept that nighJ, but Ah Choo woke about a down times, and on each occasion listened attentively, for BuspicioiiH sounds. Towards morning all inclination for sleep had banished, for be was aware the blacks usually mads an attack at dawn, and creeping a snort distance from the camp he made a circuit keenly alert for a strange sound of any description. Reassured he cteftt back and received one of the greatest shocks of his Ufe. Harry had awakened and hearing: some one moving through the bushes towards the camp quickly picked up bis rifle, and when the Chinaman's f a c� appeared round a bush brought it to bear upon him. Fortunately the fire gave a little flicker enabling Harry to recognise the intruder, and also showed Ah Choo he was on the point of being shot. "Oh, ell, no shooter, only me, my cripes," be yelled as he (lopped down on to his face. "What arc you prowling about like that for, you idiot," exclaimed Harry angrily "If the flrc hadn't biased up I should have shot you." Ah Choo's face gredually assumed its noi mal yellow from the ashen gray it had borne as he expltir.ed what ho had been doing. ' Why didn't you say you wanted a watch kept ?" demanded Harry, "we would have agree<i to it. , Next time you go on a prowl after dark let us know beforehand." Day broke, and Jim, roused by the voices, sat up exclaiming, "Why the dickens don't you go to bed. I've not been able to settle' down to sleep through your jat.beilng. Shut up and go to bed." "Do you see that faint glimmer over there ?" said Harry, pointing to the �ast. ;|2r� "Well, what of it, a bush fire or.soml^ thing I expect. Anyhow the point is are you going to sit up all night, or are you going to roost like respectable eitisens of the Never Never ?" He flatly refused to believe day was breaking, being quite sure he had not lain down for more tb�n an hour. In a few minutes, however, he received ocular demonstration of the fact, and coiling himself up on the hnap of grass and shutting his eyes resolutely said, "Bneexer, tell the mistress I'm going to have breakfast in bed." It was noon before the lad awoke and found Ah Choo sitting near, shaping a new little pod out of a piece of wood. The Chinaman had rigged some boughs to protect the lad's head from the fierce rays of the sun, and sat there guarding . him whl'v� the others sought for food. The long unbroken rest had done wonders for him, and be awoke completely refreshed looking for something to eat. "Call yourself a cook, Sneeier," he. exclaimed, "here you ore sitting there doing nothing or worse than nothing, and nothing fo.- a delicate patient to eat." "All li, all H, plenty dleckly. You eatee kangaloo or fishce. I soon cookee em." "Borh Saeeier, my son, I'll have a grilled fish first and roast kangaroo to follow. I don't require any gravy, but if you don't cook the food properly I'll find the �aure." � ? "Hi. yah," Ah Cboo exclaimed, de li rhted to find* Jim so much himself. "You i-lent.ee saucy, my word. You alto gether sauce " ? �? i (To be continued.) ' ? * i^�<S�^-i� ' i 

 Harry, raising Jim's head, poured a little into his mouth*
