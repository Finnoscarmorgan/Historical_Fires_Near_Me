 Chapter XVII. � [Continued.) 

 Gladys poured forth her rapid monologue in the sweetest, softest of voice, with a touch of disdainful languor in her tone, which re h'eved her sprightly utterances of any trace of flippancy. Perhaps on'e cf her charms lay in the contrast between her modern and some what redundant talk and the angelic dignity of her face and movements. Nothing about her went fast except her tongue, and neverthe less Clare knew she would have long fits of taciturnity when, a3 Bhe declared, her mind was kneadiner an idea. 

 'Oh, Gladys,' said Mrs. Tregaskiss, 'you have not changed a bit.' 'Dear, yes 1 have. Just wait till you get to know. I've been through the mill and I've come out of it a good deal scratched, but so hardened and brightened up that you don't see the scratches for a .while. I daresay I seem frivolous at present. But this is all encbant ingly new and crude. I've enjoyed myself ever since I loft conventionality in the shape of my maid Parker behind at Cedar Hill, sitting on riiy dress basket with cotton wool in her ears to keep out the swearing . of the bullock drivers. If you had seen her face when they brought in the saddle-bags and I told her to pack my clothes in them. Parker is going to be a trial. ? I told her to find her own way to Port Victoria and back to England if she liked, for she is too grand for her surroundings. Mother and Cassandra would have had a lit at Cedar Hill. The mosquito curtains and the wall papers would have finished them. They never get beyond the aesthetics and have no notion c-f dramatic contrast. Now I was always dramatic � even when I married Mr. Hilditeh.' Cassandra was the eldest Miss Warraker, ?who told fortunes by the stars and'* was generally romantic and superior. They were in the drawing-room now and Clare was taking off Gladys' hat and veil and giving her tea, while King stared with big solemn eyes at the visitor. ' You are a queer little angel,' said Gladys, catching the child up and kissing her. 'I wish I had one like you.' She gave a sigh and her astonishingly young face seemed for a moment to grow as old as its years. Clare had heard that the one child of. . Gladys' marriage had died as a baby and pressed her friend's hand sympathetically, say ing nothing. Mr. Chance s shuffling: footstep sounded ou the verandah and presently he came in, carrying two great bulging saddle-bags with the French heel of one kid shoe and the buckled toe of another peeping out at the aperture be neath the flap. He deposited these on the floor and stood looking at Mrs. Hilditeh with a sort of saturnine tenderness. Fair Ines had come and conquered and. old Cyrus had found the embodiment of bis romantic dreams in this dainty creature froni a world that he knew not. ' I'm thinking,' he said, ' that I'd better be getting down to my camp.' 'Oh, Mr. Chance,' cried Clare, 'don't go yet. Have some of my tea ; and, besides, I haven't half thanked you 'for bringing- me my friend. I don't think I'll try you : you can see what a pleasure you have given me.' The muscles about old Cyrus's month re laxed into an expression of benevolence. 'Didn't~-I tell you,' he answered, 'that ye might apply to me in a difficulty � short of a money one � and I'd see what I could do for you ?' ' ' I don't think much of you if you wouldn't help in a money difficulty,' said Gladys. ? 'It's an ill business to beg, to borrow, or to lend,' said old Cyrus sententious^. 'Oh, he's a miser, isn't he?' said Gladys boldly. 'That's what they told me at Cedar Hill. ' And he's enormously rich and could buy us all out and have a decent competence over. Isn't that so f 'To buy m� out wouldn't be saying a great ^eal,' answered Mrs. Tregaskiss. ' To buy you out, Gladys, would be a different matter.'' ' My husband left me five thousand a year,' said Mrs. Hilditeh gravely ; ' and if I marry again I lose every penny of it.' 'Then take the advice of old man Chance, leddy, and keep your liberty and your siller. True enough I'm a miser and a woman-hater, but I'd have been worse than that if I had given a woman the right to i-nt her hand in my pocket, for I'd have been a beggar. No, I thank you, Mistress Tregaskiss,' refusing Clare's proffered cup of tea, ' I'll be having it at the camp presently. Is the master ou the place r:' ?? ? 'He went out on the run with Mr. Shand,' Bhe answered, * ' but he ought to be coming back now. I think I hear the dogs barking.' 'Then I'll be Baying good-night,' said Cyrus. \\ Gladys turned a puzzled look upon him. ''Mr. Tregaskiss isn't a woman, ' she cried. 'Why do you want to run away from bim ? What does he mean by his camp, Clare ? Does he prefer camping to sleeping in a house, or am I turning him out hero ?' .'Old man Cyrus Chance prefers to sleep and eat at his own expense, put in Chance. 'I'm not saying that I don't take a meal .off a neighbor's corncobs or a pumpkin that would rot for want of gathering, \\mt thaf s not a ques tion of hospitality. Good-night, leddy. The rest of your pack is in the back verandah, and I hope you 11 not find any of your gewgaws missing.' * ' Listen !' said Gladys. ' When he knows that half of them are completely ruined and that Parker would die at the Bight of my crumpled teappwns. Two pairs of my bes't silk stockings are ornamenting the gum trees, and the Valenciennes frills of my petticoats torn to shreds and strewing the plain. The packhorse put down his head and kicked up nis legs and then bolted. Away went the pack and the blackboys gathered up the frag ments.' 'Silk gowns and fripperies and fallals, the like of which was never seen 015, the Leura !' Baid Mr. Chance. 'You. are a deal too 6ne for these pafts, leddy. But I would not have it altered You're good to look at, and not to 

 be confounded with the ordinary; and, your finery is }ust a part of yourself.' . 'Hearhira. I'm converting [ him already. Mr. Chance, have you forjrottcn that I'm a Woman V',: '? ? . 'Eh, but you 'and mistress there are a different brand from those other creatures of women, and not to be drafted into the same yard. I, don't count ye as women.' 'That's the prettiest compliment I've ever had paid me,' returned Gladys, and she held out her hand to him with such royal grace that old Cyrus was obliged to.talto it and perform a very awkward bow in doing so. over her outstretched lingers. 'Where's your camp going to be, Mr. Chance ?' she asked. 'Agen the waterhole, close by the blacks. They're good company for me. I've got Andy off, mistress. It cost ma a pretty penny.' ? ' I shall come down after dinner � or tea. I observe that all meals are tea here and we'll have another game of knucklebones,' said Gladys. 'Knucklebones!' repeated Mrs. Tregaskiss. 'It's his favorite dissipation; haven't you discovered that ? He has got the loveliest set. I've always lonsred to play knucklebones and last night when we were camping out he taught me ; 1 had some trouble to persuade bim that it was not derogatory to my dignity as^a woman.' 'A woman I' grunted Cyrus with an accent of contempt. ''Haven't I said I did not count you? They don't know your brand up here.' ' A goddess then � without the pedestal. I have no objection, Mr. Chance, to bfing a goddess since you decline to play knucklebones with ordinary mortals.' 'Well, anyhow,' said Cyrus, 'it's an inno cent pastime and takes skill and it's cheap.' ' And classic,' added Gladys. ' The Pom peiians played knucklebones. I've seen the sets--beauties, nearly eighteen hundred years old � in the Museum at Naples. You may dis approve of Mary Stuart and the Empress Theodora and Gibbon and the rest of your cheap literature people, but 3-ou can't trample on the Pompuiians � poor petrified corpses� they're too pathetic' The sounds of arrival became pronounced, Clare Tregaskiss's still smile might have been carved in marble. 'This is Keith,' she said. 'Keith !' repeated Gladys. 'Oh, I forgot. Your husband's name. 1 like it. I'm longing to see him. It wasn't kind of you, Clare, to meet, marry, and go off with him that 3rear I wa3 in Switzerland. I've often pictured to myself the kind of man for whom you gave up all the joys of civilisation � tall and stately, brave, simple, tender� intellectual, of course ; scorning the falsehoods .'tnd insincerity of society that you used to hold forth against ; a sort of Nature's king ; a strong man carving his course, like a river,. and making everybody in this wild, queer countiy � whites and blacks � respect and admire, him. Yes, I knew what he would be like. And now I see that I was quite right.' . At her* last words, old Cyrus, who had edged towards the front verandah, realising that an exit by the back would bring him face to face with Tregaskiss, paused and stood still, an ex pression of grini astonishment on his features. Gladys was pec-ring out at the Fcnch window, looking upon the yard, and was talcing stock of the new comer. Chance and Clare both moved near her and glanced over her sfioulder at the figure of a tall man standing by his horse and unstrapping bis v.ilise. Chance gave a queer little ejaculation and Clare's lips tightened, but she said nothing and turned away. It was Geucste. In a moment he was at the door confronting Gladys. She held out her hand, her beautiful face beaming1 and in her manner a mixture of 'the sweetest dignity and friendliness. 'I don't need any introduction to Clare's husband. I can quite understand her not re gretting the English life. I hope you will wel come her old friend for her sake.' 'Gladys,' Clare interposed, 'I ought to have told you. This is not my husband. It is our neighbor, Dr. Geneste.' She went for ward with outstretched hand. ' How do you do? We were expecting Keith. Let me intro duce you to Mrs. Hilditeh.' Geneste made his greetings becomingly and Gladys laughed at her mistake. But there was an awed almost terrified look in her eyes. Clare's composure had been admirable, but Gladys perceptions were keen. When Tregaskiss arrived half an hour later Mrs. Hilditeh was in her room unpacking the saddle-bags and otherwise preparing herself for dinner. Clare was with her and their first in timation of the master's coming was not alto gether an agreeable one. Tregaskiss was in an ill-humor; he had seen bis cattle dying, bogged in the fast-emptying waterholes ; he had_ had a longer ride than either Mr. Shand or his wife guessed, and not after stock ; on his way home there had been a stormy encounter with the drover of some travelling stock, and he had discovered that a good deal of grass had been destroyed by a bush fire. Tommy George, who came out to take his horse, was suspected of being the cause of this , last disaster through having carelessly thrown ] away a burning match when lighting his pipe j on the run. Tregaskiss attacked him, swore at him freely, ordered him to hand over his pipe, which he broke into fragments and threw at him, and. gave Shand instructions that hot another fig oj tobacco was to be served to the black boys for a month to come. He fumed on in loud, wrathful -accents. ' His horse had a Bore back and Shand came in for a share of blame for not having seen to the stuffing of the saddle! One of the stockmen was wait ing for rations. ' Oh, confound you !' said Tregaskiss. ' I'm dog tired and I'm not going to give out rations at this hour. You can stop till Mr. Shand has turned out the horses. Go after him to the yard and tell him. Or, here, Mrs. Tregaskiss will&givo them out. Clare ! Gusta, go and ask jour mistress to come out to the store. ' Clare did not wait for the summons! She turned from her occupation of hanging up some of Gladys' dresses in the cretonnecur tained wardrobe. 'I will come back presently, Gladys,' she said. 'Yes ? Stay ? Oh, Clare, was that ? Mr. Tregaskiss?' *'That was my husband,' said Mrs. Tregas kiKB stonily. ' You will find him perhaps a little different from wliat jrou expected� and from what he used to be � if Cassandra, who met him in Eugland, ever described him to you ; but you must remember we lead a rougli life and ho has been riding after cattle nil day ; and� and times arc bad and it is not surpris ing that he .should be, tired and a little irri table. Our cattle are dying for want of grass aud water and when you have been here a little 

 while you will know what ruin a bush fire may cause/' . ? -'? - . Gladys said nothing. When Clare had gone she sat down on the edjje of the bed and stared round her� at the little verandah-room with its primitive Bhutters, its walls papered with pictures from the Illustrated and Graphic; its home-made furniture and sunken earthen floor covered with rugs and matting, its rough washstaud and dressing table on which Gladys silver-backed brushes and array of toilet im plements looked so incongruous, the canvas ceiling and the velvety natch of mosquitoes in one corner waiting for darkness to leave their shelter. Glad3's shuddered. 'It wouldn't matter a bit if it weren't for him,' she murmured. 'Oh, my poor Clare, my poor dear, dear Clare? Oh, what made you do it ? And you love another man ! Oh, is no one happy, no one in the whole world ? Must one always love the wrong man ?' When Clare came back, which was not for a long time, Mrs. Hilditeh was dressed, her beautiful hair rippling over her low forehead and coiled behind with a mediaeval looking band of amethysts set in antique silver binding her head and a like belt girdling her loose mus lin and Valenciennes lace robe. There1 was not much sign of widowhood about her and she seemed to think it necessary to apologise for the fact. 'He has been dead fourteen months, dear, and I couldn't ever wear a cap. Oh, Clare, 'bIic added, coming close to her friend and laying a hand on Clare's arm, while she gazed at her with earnest eyes ; ' it is so terrible � so hideous, to be glad. But I tried to do my duty at the lust, when he got ill. They said he couldn't have lived nearly so long if it hadn't been for me.' 'I know that. A man told me you were very good to him.' Gladys withdrew her arm and went back-to the glass and adjusted a loose lock of her hair before she answered. Clare had been wonder ing how she should broach the news of Blan chard's presence on the Leura. She now saw that it was no news to Gladys, and that chance had nothing to do with their present proximity to each other. 'I knovv who that was,' Gladys answered with studied quietness. 'There is only one man on the Leura who could know anything about me and my husband. It was Ambrose Blanchard.' - 'I did not know his name was Ambrose, ' said Clare. ' Yes, it was Mr. Blanchard who recognised your photograph and told me he had known you. He said that he had admired you for your goodness to your husband.' 'I am glad,' said Gladys, 'that at any rate he did me that justice. Come, Clare. I like this little room immensely, dear; it puts me in mind of my cabin on board the Nana Sahib, only that it is a great deal larger and more comfortable. But 1 think the verandah would be a cooler place to sit in.' Chapter XVIII.� Clare's Vow. Tregaskiss, when he found out who his unseen auditress had been� Gladys informed him of the fact with perfect frankness, ac cepting his ill-temper as a matter of course and asking him various sympathetic questions as to the working of the station and the probable results of the fire � did his best to remove the impression his rough language might have made. '.A fellow is bound to swear at these niggers and bullock-drivers, Mrs. Hilditeh, J: he remarked confidentially ; ' and I'm de lighted to see that you're not horrified at our bush ways. It took me a long: time to break Clare in' � he laughed his fatuous laugh � 'but now I've got her in excellent order, though ahe is still a little inclined to give herself airs � doesn't take the cheerful view of things that you seem to do' � Gladys had been giving a sprightly account of her experiences amoug the bullock-drivers at Cedar Hill and her night's camping out � ' Imust say I admire a woman of spirit. Rum old stick Cyrus Chance, isn't he? You must have played up to him in a remarkable way to get him to bring you along, or he may have done it -out of affection to my wife. He s very fond of Clare �makes her presents occasionally.' And Tregaskiss told the story of the- six bottles of porter and Gladys began to under stand Cyrus Chance's objection to breaking bread in his bouse. She began to understand, too, Clare's far away smile. 'That's the explanation of her Sphinx look,' she said to herself. 'Oh, my poor dear, dear Clare ! Could he ever have been handsome aud frank and attractive as Cassandra described him. Perhaps in those days he hadn't taken to drinking whisky and grown red and coarse ; and perhaps he was too much in awe of Clare, when she was Miss Gardyue and 'went tq London parties, to swear before her.' Gladys had already gauged the situation and Tregaskiss's character as well. She knew that a woman who had five thousand a year as long as she did not marry again must com mand his respect. Ho would, as far as his natural tendencies aud the superior domination of whisky permitted, abstain from rough and ready language in her presence. Then her beauty ana air of fashion awed him. Tregas kiss admired her immensely, though, as he confided to Shand aud Geneste later, she was not altogether his style, put him too much in mind of ragged painters and the floppy artistic set. Tregaskiss ahyays talked of London life as though ha were intimately acquainted with all its social intricacies. He had his manner of boisterous good humor this evening, rapidly assumed for Glads'a' benefit, and chaffed Geneste about Helen Cusack, detailing the rumor he had heard in Uganda of her engage ment to young Gillespie, and bantered his wife on her late need of his professional seryices. ' She doesn't look � does Bhe, Mrs. Hilditeh � as if there had been any reason to have a doctor standing over her night and day for more than a week ? I told Clare when I came home that I hadn't seen her looking so well .and young aud handsome since she first arrived on the Leura.' ' I think she is very handsome, certainly, Mr. Tregaskiss,' replied Gladys with bold ness, ' but if you think she is looking well, I don't agree with you. I should say she wanted a lot of nursing and taking care of.' Geneste could not help giving her a grateful glance. He had been a little afraid of the coming of Gladys Hilditeh, Now he felt sure of her sympathy. She was a many-sided person, this young woman. In European society she was all that there is of the luxurious modern. Here on the Leura she showed a reaction in favor of barbarism and declared that there was nothing she . enjoyed so much as unadul terated nature, and that she was thoroughly tired of London banalities. She wasintenselyin tefested in bush life ; wanted to know-all about 

 thestrike� she had come in at Cedar Hill for a demonstration against the free laborers, as the imported shearers from the South were called� enquired as to the large sheejjownere of the district, and without once mentioning Ambrose Blarichard's name contrived to get a good deal of information about tho Ousacks and their household and dependents. Her lively chatter covered the embarrassment which was now inseparable from any inter course between Mre. Tregaskiss and Goneste when it took place under the eye of others. What an ignorant provincial sort of woman she was after all, Clare reflected bitterly ; how untrained in the ways of the wosld. Gladys, she thought, would have found in the situation only the piquancy of dramatic contrast. Every tone and gesture of this attractive lady seemed to indicate a perfect capacity for deal ing with a slioal of contraband admirers. Blanchard's tone had suggested that her methods of distraction had not been alto gether as admirable as East-End visiting. Dinner was over; they were all m the verandah and Tregaskiss was showiug off Ning's accomplishments and making her go through her last 'ghiribal,' which is black for a song and dance representing the sound and action of some animal. Ning's ' gbiribal' was of the wild musk duck ; her little arms flapped and she puffed out her checks in imitation of the duck's cry � Ya nniya nariiiga l'uanbu ngi go J llingo nhikarai Wlioogli ! 'Did you ever see such a picaninny, Mrs. Hilditeh ?' he cried in boisterous delight. Gladys was enchanted. Here was true local color ; here was nature unadulterated. At last she found herself free from the asphyxiating influence of modern civilisation. Shertoo must learn a 'ghiribal.' Tregaskiss made the child repeat her performance. He was at his best when playing with King and Gladys began 'to feel a less dislike to her hust. By-and-b3Te Cyrus Chance's camp fire glim mered in the distance beyond the cluster of blacks' gun3%is, and Gladys declared her in tention of taking a moonlight stroll and paying him a visit. She did not ask Tregaski�s if he would escort her, an omission which made him sulky, and he retaliated on his wife by desiring her to remain and help him with his office work � that dreary business of writing down be neath the date all that had bsen done on the station that day', the number of cattle branded if there were branding going on, the camps mustered, the rations given out. To-night Tregaskiss had more serious matters occupying him. The bank had written him a letter of warning and had issued a veiled threat of sending a representative to report on the station. There were other pay ments to bo made � the store account at Uganda, the fencers, and other items into which Tregaskiss did not enter in detail. It was a question of selling store cattle in order to raise money for immediate expenses ; and the drought was threatening severely and the market was bad. Then he propounded a scheme which had occurred to him during dinner. Could Clare 'work -her friend Mrs. Hilditeh,' as he phrased it, get her to make a loan or buy a small share in Mount Wombo, and so furnish a supply of cash. Clnrc recoiled. Impossible. She felt that she would almost rather starve. It would be easier to apply to Cyrus Chance, hopeless as would be the result. Tregaskiss upbraided her for lukewarmness as regarded his interests. She cared for nothing as long as she had her ease and could stay at home cooling herself in the verandah with the children, but she would feel differently when she no longer had a roof over her head, and so on. Clare gazed out into the night. The gaunt gum trees and the ghostly gidias seemed to mock the very suggestion of freedom. To be roofless and alone ! The very idea was like letting in a rush of fresh wind. The passion of futile longing that seized her seemed unbear able. She got up and paced the room. Though the window was open it did not seem to have a breath of air; tho hum of the mosquitoes was maddening and the flying ants circling towards the lamp and dropping their wings on the table cover. . Tregaskiss leaned back in the office chair smoking and occasionally expectorating through the open window. He too got up, mixing himself a glass of spirits ; he always kept it in tho safe where wtre the station ledgers aud the strychnine for poisoning native dogs. Clare thought ofjGencsie and Gladj-s wander ing by the lagoon � wandering if he were telling Gladys of her wretchedness. No, he was too loyal for that ; he would know that she could not bear to be pitied, even by Gladys, just yet awhile. She had exchanged no word with Geneste except that commonplace good-night siuce those in which he had told her of his love and she had bade him never speak of it again. Did he mean to take her altogether literally. He might have written to her. There had been an opportunity at the last coming of Jemmy Hodd. Perhaps he had been afraid that her husband would open the letter. Had he in truth meant those words, had he not perhaps repented them ? Her heart was crying out and hungering to hear him repeat that 'I love you.' And lie had never asked her if she loved him back. Oh, if she could go to him and put her head upon his breast and feel his arms around her, and say to him in his ear just once as she had said to herself, ' 1 love you with all my soul.' Tregaskiss's rasping voice roused her. 'That mine has turned out no good and the others arc just as likely as not to be rank sells, lly God, I'm sick of the whole concern. I feel that I want a jolly good spree with a pleasant com panion and to throw worries to the devil for a bit anyhow. What's the use of slaving and sweating to have the bank down upon you and life to begin all over again. If it wasn't for the children, I declare to heaven that but for the picaninii3r, and if I could manage to make a lucky hit over one of theso Wirra reefs I'd cut the whole blessed business and never come back again. Don't stand like a stock there, Clare,' he cried out. ' ' Go out if you want to and find your fine friend ._ You're jealous, I suppose, lest she should be flirting with Geueste. Go on out. You're no good to me. If I'd liad a different sort; of wife I shouldn't feel as I feel to-night.' She was moving away, but at the last words came back to him. ' How do you feel, Keith ? Tell me what is really the matter with you and I'll do my boBt to help you. I don't be lieve it's all money difficulties. You seem to me to have utterly changed since you were away that week at Ilganda.' 'That's true enough,' he said moodily. 'I found put something then that I hadn't known before and it has upset me, that's alL But it has nothing to do with you,' 

 'Then I won't ask any more,'- she answered' proudly, 'and Til go out and find Gladys.' ?'.,. When she had gone Tregaskissitook afresh .-? draught from his glass, and drawing his blot ting pad to hinvijegan. to* write \\in his big, boyish hand. ' My own darling� I longed eo for'-4he sight- . of your dear little bright face that 1 rode alT7 the way over to the surveyor's to-day, fortyfive miles there and back, and I couldn't have done it if I hadn't changed nags at the fencers. You can just imagine my disappointment when I heard there that you had gone away from tho Ococks, and that it was no use my going on. And now I don't know how 1 can Bee you, for that old dragon Mrs. Cusack d oesu't approve of my paying you too much at tention. I'm feeling uncommonly bad about it all, Hetty. Somehow you caring for me, which I never guessed till just lately, eeemB to have altered everything and to have turned me from a steady goin' contented chap into a reckless miserable devil, not minding much. what happens to him. It drives me mad to think of how jolly we might have been if everything was right, and then tho thought of the picaninny, and all the rest of the wretched business, sends me mad again the other way. Though I hate the idea of losing you I be lieve the right unselfish oourse for me would be to go straight away for a trip to England or somewhere- only I am too hard up just now to think of that. Aud failing my clear ing out, it would bo best for you to leave the Cusacks and find a home in another place, aud if you forgot me so much the better for you. 1 hat's what I wanted to talk to you about, and I'll try and work a trip to Brinda Downs if it's possible. Has Cusack gob through his shearing, and when is he goiner to muster ? You might suggest to the old lady to invite my wife's friend, a real ? ' Tregaskiss had got thus far when Shand came in to report that part of the paddock fence was broken down and that the mob of horses kept in readiness for the specials had' taken to the bush. With an oath Tregaskiss got up, putting the half-written letter between the leaves of the station-ledger in the cup-, board, which he always kept locked, the key of whjch he now turned and put in his pocket. Then he followed the new chum out to see about sending the black boy after the missing animals. Meanwhile Clare wandered forth past the garden fence towards the lagoon. In the dis tance she could hear Ning's shrill prattle and remembered that Gladys had taken the child when she aud Geneste started to find Cyrus Chance's camp. When she had gone a little wa3r in the same direction Mrs. Tregaskiss turned and made for tho opposite end of tho lagoon, where the gidia scrub grew almost to the water and where there were no fires or sign of habitation. To meet Geneste now in the company of Mrs. Hilditeh and of her child was more than she could bear. . Then she. heard her husband's coo-c* and shout for Tommy George and the black boys to ' Murra make haste and go after yarraman that had bolted.' She knew that he would be at the camp presently and would no doubt join tho others. In the moonlight she could see Gladys' white dress and tall figure as she stood in front of one of the gunyas watching a group of blacks playing eardson their blankets. To Gladys the blacks' camp had the charm of novelty and Tregaskiss would bo amused at her questions and would make the boys ' show off ' and forget his worries whatever tbej' might be. (To be continued.)
