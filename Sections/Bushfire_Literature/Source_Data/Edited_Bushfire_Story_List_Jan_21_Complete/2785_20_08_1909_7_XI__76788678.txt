 (By the A&thor of 'Through Starloss Night,' Etc.) 

 CHAPTER' XI. 

 Hot winds, with thick dust, and ' a thermometer which indexed abnormal beat Ye't within the great wards of tho Alfred Hospital there were cool-' ness and subdued light which� as com pared to the glare outside � were de 

 lightful. Jean, moving to aud fro, felt like one In � blissful dream, It was only her first month of 'hospital tte, but . already she felt as if sho filled her .rightful niche. Looked at rationally, her life seem ed ho-pdlessly shattered. Every now and again sho realised this; yet In her inmost heart lurked a conviction that all would yet be well. So far as possible she tried to live; only in the 'busy present. H-.r The charwoman, .rough malds-of-all. ?work, under paid factory girls, worn out mothers, Ill-used wives, the waifs and strays of civilisation� 'these wero her charges. And into their sordid un lovely lives she. camo like a ray of golden sunlight. Jeanie never know it, but many a lover-tossed creature, opening wild delirious eyes and seeing her pale pure faco bending over her, paused In her . raving as at the vision of an angel. And in thnt mfuisn tho thmhhtn'T'fr'VP.r 

 lost some- of Us heat� the wild brain Itome of its madness, Exactly a week after Jean's entry Into the hospital, Ursula Murchison left Melbourne. She had not seen Gil bert Hcnnlker slnco she had told him who tho missing man was. Ho had ?hurried from tho hotel a stricken man, and, with one accord, they had agreed t that, until the suspicion that 'her hus I band was now dead was confirmed, I . they had better not meet. f Ursula accepted the first engage ment which camo to hand, which was ?to teach the children of a farmer in the Goulburn Valley, in the north of .Victoria, When 'Arcadia Homestead' was reached, it proved to be a very pretty place � the house being picturesque and sloping into a beautiful frult-gavdeiV with trollised and vine-covered walks. Under shady fig-trees were garden ceats, and a j-cach-treo, ?with loaded branches; grew close to her bedroom ' window. ' -Still, pretty ag 'Arcadia' was, it was In an agricultural district, . and an Australian farm. is dull in the extreme. After tho cooler Upper Murray cli mate, Ursula found tho heat Intense; and, as* hot days succeeded each other, she grew thinner, paler, more sad '~^6ysif tfl'an ever. More and' more she envied Jean her busy life. In hers 

 there was no interest strong enough to detain her thoughts from tho wretched ipast. Ever since tho river ac ' --cident she had been a victim to in-. somnia,,.which seemed to Increase. ?When, exhausted by (hours of feverish tossing, she fell asleep, it -was to seo Gilbert's -face � haggard with the misery ?of their' last farewell � or her hus J ...band's, white, remorseful, wretched, I'' as it was just before that awful ra.ll V,-- way accident, or looming ghost-like out of .the London fog, or staring down . . at her with eyes of hate. And so � ill, wretched, nervous, and overstrung� she dragged through the - \\ summer till the end of February. To ? -wards .the middles of one very hot day -''?.. -there came, suddenly borno on the wind, a smoll of burning. The child ren stopped in the midst of their les sons and looked ,nt each other, 'Bush fire!' they cried. 'Let's go ?MBte^' Mother!' J-^-''' 'Mrs. Lawson stood in the Kitchen anxiously consulting with tlm maid servant. The air all round was thick with smoke, and the sky was a dull and coppery red. 'The worst -of It is,' said Mrs. Law k son, addressing Miss Murchison, 'that m^^ the men are' over at Kirk's. Tho fire ^^Bfs between (their place and ours, so ^^^?KSj�jg3�^ivt back to help us. My ^^^HwliPit -s'tato of 'lllul they'll be ^^^^HP|[�rf'm any danger?' '? ^^^^^Mreijr was r^10 ''acoll'c answer. T^MSjIpipoke, 31rs. liomson divested - ' heTHI^Mf her' dress, .put on a thick \\adersHft, and tied a woollen hood round Mr head. 'No time to lose,' she explained. ' ''We're safe for the 'present; but the Ticks ^ill go as sure as fate, and, if : -the farm buildings and the house go too, Lawson's a ruined man.' ', 'What can I do to help?' *X3o into tho houso and make oat 

 meal water� the children will show you how, Tho- men from Ford's will be over as soon as they see what is up, .and they'll help 'beat off.' But they'll want drinlc by tho bucket, for the work's no Joke, I tell you. IsTow, Mary, ?''...? pome on.' Armed1' with boughs to beat out tho advancing Ore, the farmer's wife and . . the stout servant set out. . 'They mean to beat off on tho north ?:-. .side,' said Ho� 'that's the side the i iflro's coming from. 'Ah!' she cried exultantly a moment later. 'Ford's men are' at tho paddock gate! We're ? ? al! right now, to they'll help beat . ; . ot�!' .?':.'??' Avid so they did, but in. vain, for ' ' ' farm .buildings, ricks, and expensive ':?'.?? agricultural implements went, and by ?-'?: ' three o'clock the house- Itself was : ? . ??'' 'threatened. ? Long before -this time, Ursula was on' active- service. The children and 

 she filled buckets, billies, and every vessel procurable with water from the tanks, i ; ' The servant, mounted on a ladder, handed them to Mrs. Lawson, who, perched on the roof, poured water all around. The flames had not yet reached the dwelling, but the smoke was blinding and choking, and sparks flew all around, Suddenly Mrs. Law son flagged. 'I can't do any more,' she said faintly. 'Call the men. It's no use trying- to save the slock now, they ?must come and help hero.' Ursula (lew to the blazing out buildings, iuu\\, after a hasty eonsulta ?tiony flight .-was , counselled.,... . It was, Uul^ea, :Jrtp vv^i^^^lMil^^h^^-giE' 'The wind will' f a v o? us ,S''.$e?if i m'itkb for the river,' cried Mrs. Lawson. 'Faix, we'll niver win there!' said Pat O'Shane despondently. 'It's ns far as the watter-hole we'll git,' said another man. 'Come, llttlo ones, 'that's bare a quarter mile.' He seized Flo, Pat caught up Lizzie, and the women followed. They tore through the blinding smoke. On they hurried, their heads and shoulders wrapped In hastily torn hnlf-blankets to protect them from tho showering sparks; Mm through wooded stretches of half cleared land, The, wind, at the back of them, now blew with increased and frightful velocity, and tho flames leaped from tree-top to tree-top In lurid magnificence. At last the water hole was reached.' Alas, the water, was fringed with burning timber! As far as they dared, they waded in, scooping up soft mud to cover and cool their burnt feet and scorched arms. 'Heaven bo praised!' exclaimed Mrs. Lawson, pressing thy little ones to her heart, ' But, at that moment, there came a sound � sudden, appalling, deafening. A falling, tree erashod 'Into the fought-for refuge. And where the mothfir had clasped her children lay only a smouldering giant red-gum trunk, and, pressed beneath Into Ihe 'water-hole, were crushod bodies, no longer suffering -or In pain or fear. 'I can't understand the case, Nurse,1' paid Doctor Young. 'Sho certainly makes no progress,' he continued. 'Yet, somehow, I doubt if there be really any Injury to the spine. 1 Imagine the nervous shock and conse quent cerebral tdlsturbances have more to do with her present condition. Was �he struck by th^ falling timber, did they say?' ' . ' 'No � both the m'en agree that she escuiped scot-free. Il3ut they say that, though untouched, .iitas Milrchlson fell like a log. She was unconscious, tho local doctor says, for days, nnd 'Nurse tells me that during tho Journey down 

 she hardly stirred.' 'H'nv! Well, let us hope a few weeks' rest will brace up her nervous system. But not too much quiet, Xurse; try and rouse her a little. Let all her friends come and see her.'' 'She has none but Nurse Norman and a Mrs. Lang.' 'Oh, yes, she has' � the doctor laughed� 'a very; great friend, tool He has called several times to in quire. Next time ho may (see her.' As the doctor passed out he saw Nurso Norman, who. was officiating In the mule wards, in ' tho -'c-irrfflor. She had been up to fnqujvc about Ursula. ana now� as It was her 'day off'� 

 was going out. Gilbert Hennlker had asked htT to errant him an Interview. He met her outside the hospital, nnd1 they went to the Botanical Gardens. 'He .told -her his news from tho o.'d country. Tho London detectives acting with colonial oollnborutors � had discovered that Frank Vernon had not been drowned, and had left England under tho name of John Normun soon after Ursula had ' -met him in the London fog. Norman wan his mother's maiden name, and at. that time a maternal uncle lived in Sydney, But before the date of Frank Ver min's dlsnppearqiK'o .ond supposed death, that unclu hud died, It was discovered that lie had left some pro perly to his nephew-, ciouplou with the condition tluit h'p would take the name of Norman. Posf-lbly Frank 'Yemen knew this before- .'.he left England. When' he arrived .In Sydney he took possession of his now property, and � u.s all his own fortune was colonlally Invested� communication with Eng land ceased, A month or two later he disappear ed from Sydney, and took 'part In an exploring expedition In Northern Australia. On his return lie drew on his bankers for a small amount and again disappeared, This last time of withdrawal from society coincided with his 'meeting with, Jean. Since his dis appearance from the. boat he had not drawn on his bankers, and no proof was forthcoming that' ho was either dead or alive. -. 'I'm sure he still lives!' Jean de clared. Gilbert looked anything but pleased. 

 'It is indeed a wretched.. tangle,' sho' added, 'But I have a. strong ldeathat all will end well for every one of us,' Day after day passed, and Ursula's recovery seemed more and more doubtflil. Not even her interviews with Gilbert roused her, and melan cholia and great emaciation set in. Jean spent all her 'hours off duty, by her side, but these were few Indeed. Typhoid was unusually severe that season, and the nurses .were greatly overworked and tho wards over crowded. .Some of tho staff fell ill, and this made matters all the worse for tho others.- It was pathetic lo &'eo how quickly any vacated bed was filled by another fever- wracked form. Just before Jpan left the wa'rd ono evening, another sufferer had passcl away, and ns she went off duty a 'stretchey was brought in. , VFever,' sho heard the porter say. Cheery ns she was by nature, 'Jean ?had moods of gloom. That night she went to bed, praying that sho might never see another day, But when morning came she rose refreshed and more cheerful. , As Jean entered 'tho wavd she glanced 

 at the bod in the right-hand corner, and screens 'encircled it. Ah� then it must be a bad case! As sho passed^ the night-nurse came out from behind the screens, 'This is tho worst case in thp ward,' sho told Jean 1� 'Kypliold with me ningitis. , Relapsed case; I should judge.'.

 In the hour of his death! At the end of his wasted life! JSVhon the morning broke Jeanie knew that she would be utterly alone, for, nearly a. week 'there had been no Change, and the doctor had said that before dawn tho end must come. Ursula was drifting deeper Into hope, less melancholia, which shut her of� from. the world as completely as could iron, doors, And Jack, lay dying, with never.'a word or look for her. ifAs t'he^Vattih'er. thought all this, the Inartlculato moaning ceased and, the breathing grew softer. .'Jean listened. \\. fYes,, yEhe /had-, often heard ibre,athlng iso'ftentl'lke'thaf.^ There would come a [gal'plnfc'pahae-^s'iie listened .for it� th'ffi ??fflftejBpa^Hr'eathta-g, followed by pause's wnTcn Hvould grow longer.
