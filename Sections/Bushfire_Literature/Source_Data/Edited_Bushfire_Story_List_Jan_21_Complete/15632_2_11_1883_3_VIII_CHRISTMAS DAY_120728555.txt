 In Three Parts. 

 BY VT2BTJN. 

 Chapter yiii.�christmas Day. 

 A clear �-...'I cloudless sky, a pleasant breeze . tempering the warmth of tho sun, 

 jng the atmosphere cool and pleasant notwitb standing tho summer season and tropical c 

 mate-a day that would tempt the veriest sluggard to be up and about. Such ^ 

 � 'Christmas morning that greeted our fnends on 

 tbe diggings as they emerged from their ten , and saw reflected in tho iace of nature a holj calm, and solemn silence," typical of the peace and goodwill that should fill all christian 

 hearts on that-blessed anniversary. 

 Charlie had quite recovered now from ins visit to Warden Creek. He had, of course,^ related all particulars, with the exception of tho whispered communication conveyed by �Rory to Annie, of which he was ignorant, to , Tim on his return. His mate had questioned 

 him very closely again�as though searching for some missing link, in the events of tbe day. But Charlie had steadfastly maintained that Rory had first simply rescued him from his : dilemma in the butchers' shop, and had then 

 insisted, merely "for tho fun of the thing, 

 upon the adjournment to the Royal. He was certainly quite unable to account for tlie sadden change in Annie's behaviour towards him, as also for tlie threat she pronounced against Rory upon discovering the name of Charlie's mate. Still Tiin was dissatisfied � with the recital. _ M 

 "It was all a prepared plan of Red Rory s,' 

 be said, at last, "whatever you may think, Charlie, I am sure of that. I warned him before," 

 he added, "when he crossed me in a . sowewhat similar manner, but I will liavo a 

 reckoning with him now, and settle matters 

 'once and for all." 

 He spoke with a calmness that-was evidently forced, and tho strain upon his self-control was apparent in the stern fixedness of his face. ' Nor would he, as doubting his own powers of t repression, continue to discuss the matter at � '/that time, or give any reason for the cause of 

 the effect his name had produced upon Gentle '. Annie's demeanour. And so, during the few days that had intervened since Charlie s ad*? 

 venture and this Christmas morning, the affair had not been again referred to between them. It had, however, occupied a prominent position in Charlie's thoughts, and he had fully decided to seize the first opportunity to attempt to dissuade 

 Tim from taking any farther steps in the matter. Rory had not yet returned to the camp, nor had they since heard anything of hiui, although Charlie had made frequent enquiries concerning him from those whom business 

 had taken into the township. The man was of a roving, restless disposition, never remainimr 

 long at the one place, so that thero �was a chance that he might never return ; bnt, on the other hand, any day might bring him back. And remembering his imperious manner . and reckless character, and knowing, too, Tim's : unbending sternness in following the path he . deemed right, and the strong feelings that he � appeared to entertain in this matter, as well ? as tho antipathy with which he evidently regarded 

 tho other, caused Charlie to live in the ' constant dread of a meeting betweeen the two . men. Tim had been reserved and reticent in ? his manner since the occurrence, but this morning, 

 as though influenced by the season, he seemed to have thrown aside or overcome his . sterner mood, and superintended Charlie s 

 labours in the preparation of the conventional ' pudding, in quite a hearty, jovial spirit. And a ? very excellent pudding it turned out to be 1 �" Charlie's pride of his share in its production . being only equalled by the manner in which he 

 ' showed his appreciation of its merits when tho �: time for discussing it arrived. After dinner, 

 they strolled across tbe ridges and amongst the gullies, picking up and breaking pieces of quartz that lay scattered about tho ground, not so much in the hopes of finding a gold: 

 bearing reef, as for pastime, not but that the V'possible contingency of a discovery was also 

 before their eyes, at any rate those of the younger man. Tim explained the way in ivliich reefs w*ere worked, the direction in which they ran, how to search for them, w hat was meant by the underlay, walls, &c., and other mysteries in connection with quartzreefing. 

 They, visittd the horses, which wore ^hobbled on a grassy flat about a mile from the 

 camp, inspecting their condition with a view to their capacity of carrying themselves, their tools and rations on the prospecting tour, as soon as the welcome rain should come. Then, stretching themselves at full length beneath a shady tree, they talked of Charlie's home people. Tim seemed never to tire of this subject. 

 Silent the while himself, excepting a stray word or question,-leading the lad on to enlarge upon this, his favourite topic. Thus, 

 ;the summer afternoon passed quickly away,. ' the lengthening shadows were warning 

 them that it was time to return to tho camp, when Charlie, encouraged by his companion's manner, ventured to recur to Red Rory, a snb 

 ject never within the last few days, long absent � from his thoughts. Not heeding the ominous 

 set of his companion's features at the mention of the name, he was continuing to urge the ad� 

 visability of allowing the affair to rest, when 

 ' Tim interrupted him. 

 ''No, Charlie, no. I am the best judge of � this. You dKii't know this man as X know . hini. His who)SrSim in life appears to be 3 

 desiro to drag others down to his own degraded level. I will give you one instance. There was a young fellow on the Cape diggings, who had been unfortunate. He was a well-broughtup, 

 honest lad, about your age, and I did what I could to i>ut him straight, and, as I thought, succeeded. But this man came between us, and the youngster is now nothing but a publicliouse 

 loafer, always drunk when he can get : � grog, or else chained up to the log for thieving. 

 ?There aro other cases that I could mention, 

 some, perhaps, not quite as bad, others even worse, and all the work of Red Rory." 

 As he pronounced the name, although his 1 voice and words throughout were calm and measured, ho rose from the ground as though he could not keep still under the excitement lie was endeavouring to repress, and with clenched hands, walked hurriedly backwards j and forwards beneath the tree. "And now," 

 he continued, his lips compressed, and his teeth set savagely, speaking to himself, "he Would add this lad also to the miserable list." 

 "Tim ! Tim ! you surely don't fear for me, neither Red Rory, nor anyone else, could make me become, as that poor fellow you mentioned just now." said Charlie, who had also risen, laying his hand affectionately on his 

 mates' shoulder. 

 " But I do fear for you. Did you know that man as I know him, you would say that I had cause. He has some hellish power, that ap: pears irresistable. You have heard of snakes fascinating their victims, and so luring them to destruction. Well, so it is with him. But he shall never exert that influence over you. 

 X am fore-warned this time, and I will let him ' see and know that I am fore-armed too." 

 Looking into his mate's eyes, wondering at his strange excited manner, so widely different from his usual colour self-possession, Charlie ' doubled for an instant whether this were nrj �insanity. He had heard and read of instances �of monomania, in which the patient on all but one: particular subject' is perfectly sane and rational, but at the slightest reference,to the 

 ona"top:o the balance of his mind is on the iiwtiut upset, and lie is to all intents and purposes, 

 until the fit is passed, a maniac. But it was only for an instant. Morbidly sensitive, upon this matter, through much solitary brooding, 

 ho might be and doubtless was, but Charlie could not conceive it to be possible, that the man whom frjm admiring and respecting he had learnt to love, couldbeso lerribly afflicted, and neither he, nor anyone else, have the slightest suspicion of it. He saw however the utter futility of pressing the matter further, and that his only chance of. gaining his ends, would be by a complete change of tactics. Whilst'they had been talking, the sun haddisappearedina 

 gorgeous golden bed, and a few 

 palii stars,were already visible.. "Come Tim," ' said Charlie, "let us b3 moving back to the ' canip, l am sorry that I cannot persuade you' to think with'me,, so let us say no more about? it." ' ' ' : :� ; 

 "That's right my boy, I too am strry, that I cannot give way to you, as.you are so anxious about it. But I see my duty straight before 

 me, and I must need do it." ~ 

 " Well, look here Tim," said Charlie, after they walked a short distance in silence, '.'at least, you can humour me to this extent. Let us strike our camp in the morning. We might just as well be fossicking on some other creek, till tho wet season, as stop here, and it will be a change too. What do you say ?" 

 "T see what you mean my lad, and I'm sorry you want tc shift just now. But to show you, that I'am anxious to humour yon, I'll agree 

 to that." 

 Charlie was delighted at the success of his scheme, tlioy would now, he thought, not meet Rory again, or at any rate for some time, and by then he hoped Tim's feelings would be softened down, and an outbreak between the two men easily avoided. So ho chatted gaily of their future plans as they walked homeward, making up for, and not apparently noticing, his companions silence. The short tropical twilight was soon passed, and the stars were thick in tho heavens, and the moon shining brightly on their track as they neared the camp. Leisurely strolling down the creek, they saw as they approached the rocks front of their tent tho usual muster of men assembled, and mild though the night was, a bright fire burning cheerfully in theirmidst. Their course led them directly past this group, and when closo enough to distinguish voices, they heard, to Charlie s dismajr, Red Rory, who occupied a prominent position on a large boulder, holding 

 forth in a loud voice to the rest/ Glancing at his mate's face, ho saw there, the same expression 

 that had so startled him, but a short 

 time before. 

 "Come Tim, lefc's'hiirry up and get supper,' he said, trying to lead him past. But Tim' either did not hear, or if so did not heed him, but walked straight on towards the centre of 

 the group. 

 In his confusion at thus finding himself so suddenly face to face with the danger he had been so anxious to avoid, he failed to catch the first few sentences of the speaker, although ho distinctly heard, someone whisper in his ear, 

 "Hold on Charlie, here's a lark, Rory's been and got drunk in at the creek, and now he's tolling us the yarn, as he says, of what made him the biggest blackguard on the diggins." 

 These few sentences served to recall his scattered senses, so moving closer to his mate's side, and resolving manfully to stand by him whatever happened, he too commeuced to listen 

 to the speakers with the rest. 

 "And I've heard since from them as lived through it," Rory was saying, "that a bitter, | bitter time it was all over Ireland, let alone j Gal way. I was but a child myself at the time, 

 and lived with my mother and brother in a poor, tumble-down cabin, a wretched miserable 

 place, not fit to shelter j>igs, let alone women and children, lly father was at this time, not long dead, whether from drink or what, I never knew; anyway, I've heard he was fond of his drop, and I know he was found lying, one morning, in a ditch, stone dead, and 

 an empty whiskey bottle beside him." 

 Charlie, who while listening attentively to the recital, bad also been closely scanning Tim's face, iii the hope of seeing some signs of his relenting, but in vain. Surprise and interest 

 there undoubtedly was, but the stern, hard set of his features did not relax one iota,' as ho stood with his eyes, in which the fierce and savage light still shone fixed upon the 

 speaker. 

 "Well, lads," continued Rory, "we three were living together, as I told you, in that wretched hovel in that miserable cold winter. Living did I say ? Dying it should have been. Sometimes nothing to eat all day, sometimes a potato or two, sometimes a turnip. I didn't notice it then,-but I've often thought of it since, that I never towards the last, saw bite or sup pass my mother's lips. Well, one night lads, the same moon that you see up there looking on us now, was shining bright and cold and staring at us then�one uip-ht, a bitter cold one, freezing hard, and the snow lying a foot or maybe two deep outside, my brother and I were sleeping together on a little bunk, and lying close for warmth.- I woke up crying with the cold, and I saw, half asleep as I was, by the moonlight shining through the broken roof, my mother who must havo been crouched up in a corner of the cabin, get slowly up, come over to where "we lay, take some covering from off her shoulders, and spread it over us, then kissing our lips�and I remember now that her lips seemed cold to me�go back again as I thought to bed, but I was asleep before she had crossed the floor. And now lads I will tell you, why I love no man, woman, or child upon God's earth, that I fear neither God, man, nor devil, that my hand is against every man, and for aught I care, every man's hand against me. When I woke in the morning, wakened by my brothers cries, my mother lay 

 a corpse upon the earthern floor. Starved to death by hunger, that our bellies should be as full as she could fill them. Starved to death by cold, that our bodies should be as warm as she could make them, and no man's hand was stretched out to help or to save her, neither 

 God's uor man's." 

 The tone of his voice, as was natural to him, had been high, but he had spoken, so far,'with a self-control that was remarkable, remembering 

 the subject up >n which he had enlarged, and how little accustomed he was to put the' least restraint upon his-words or actions. ? But now, as you may have seen in a bush fire, when a fallen tree lying, upon its track, at the touch of a spark upon the withered leaves, bursts hissing, cracking, roaring, flaming in the air, so tho remembrance of which be had spoken, appeared 

 to ignite with equal fury the exposive fire of his smouldering passion, and he continued, 

 almost shrieking out his words, and gesticulating violently with his. arms: .."If there's , a man here who would not have done the same, let him dare to say so now, and I will tell him to his face that lie is a liar or a coward, or more Ukely both." 

 There was a moments dead silence. Charlie whose attention had been completely absorbed 

 in the narrative he had just heard, to the exclusion of his own more immediate concerns�was 

 in the very act of turning, towards his mate, fully anticipating that this disclosure would have turned aside his bitter feelings! when to his surprise and consternation, Tim,' 

 his face working convulsively, and his hands ' clenched, stepped forward, and standing im- j mediately in front of Rory,, at a distance of ten or twelve paces, commenced in a.deep, sterii voice, slowly and deliberately, as though keep! ing his tongue in check, fearing lest it might escape altogether beyond his control. - . j 

 | " There is one inah1 here, who.dares to say 

 to.your face,'that it is you who is the coward.: 

 j Mp^/.;tban - ' .That;'the [ndbte, sainted! 

 woman who bore you, and who died for you, 1 had better heve stabbed instead of kissed you ' where you lay, in the innocence of your child- , hood, and then the noble purpose for which i she sacrificed her life, had never been betrayed 

 by such a foul-mouthed traitor. And I, yes I > your brother say so." 

 For an instant Rory appeared as though paralysed and lielplesB. The blood left his face, leaving it a ghastly white, seeming whiter from the contrast of his dark, red hair. But only for an . instant. Then tho hot blood rushing back as suddenly as it had disappeared, he shouted furiously� 

 : "You, my brother! You lying dog 1" " 

 Then, as Tim approached towards, hira, the moonlight falling full upon his face, he continued� 

 . . , ; ? " Back madman! Back I say ! or�" ' / j ; ; . While speaking he had drawn a 'revolver; from .his belt, and ns the last words passed His' lips,' and before Charlie, who was besido liis still advancing mate�had time to intervene,, the report of a shot sounded clear and distinct in the still air pf the Christmas night, and Tiui fell backwards to the ground shct through the body. : Charlie sprang forward to seize him, but received 

 a blow upon the temple from the butt end of the revolver, which knocked him senseless. 

 Then, ere the bystanders�hurrorstruck at this unexpected scene�had recovered from the shock, Rory sprang across the rocks and ran into the bupli. A dozen men were soon upon his track, and several shots were fired after hiin, but favoured by the start he had got, and tlio rough nature of the country, ho soon baffled his pursuers, who returned in twos and threes during the night, the last lot reporting having lost sight oi him in a dense scrub some four miles from the camp.
