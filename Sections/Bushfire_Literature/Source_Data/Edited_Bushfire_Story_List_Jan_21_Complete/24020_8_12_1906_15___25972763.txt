THE DOCTOR. 

 By M. FORREST. 

 It was a cold night. A westerly wind blew gustdy among the tall sparse-leaved blue-gums along the banks of the lagoon, where the long dry 

 weeds whispered eerily tog?t:lier. On the tfteps of the sitatiom house* "the girl drew 'her woollen sloiwl doier about her shoul ders, and shivered. The man. standing a step or two below lier, laid Ihis ihand on her arm, which felt warm anid: toEti 'tihrough her wrap. " You ifeei cosy enough ; but you nre fertuivering. You had better go inside, dear." She stamped iher foot pdttLiMy on. 'the �hard veranda boards. " How ifond you are of your professional capacity, Reggie ! I believe you would (proscribe all sorts of 'horrors in ilhe way of tonic tablloids and capsules ifor me if you fchoughl I would take them !" "No, I wouldn't!" he answered ligh'fcly. " You don't need any itonic-, 1 am sure." In the paile oold glimmer of tihe stars and tl�e dusk of the moonPess niglit it was impof-ibte to distinguish her features, but .he conjured up a mental! visJon d ;the red of her smooth young cheek, and the strong, firm set of her white throat and shoulders. He laughed softly. " You arc the picture ot ihealth, dear !" She did not answer, but lojkei away over his head, to tl>e dark line of scrub on 'the ifar side of the lagoon, while some bird of tlbe night caiUed harshly from the shadow. " I shall ndt be able to cDme out on Sunday, I am afraid," lie said. " 1 l�ve rather an anttereHting case 1 am matching at the hospital." " J)on't 'tell me about it, please. I hate oases. 1 think you oare for nothing in the world but your patiantU !" " Olive ! Don't you think you are a Wttle unreasonable ? My patierrta are the means whereby 1 live�well, not so mucii that perhaps, a* that my profe?i4on is the one ;thing in the world 1 am most fitted if or." " Awl the (position I am most unfitted ifor is to "be a doctor's wife. 1 ?hate sick people ! I can't be/ir the paraphernalia of illne�s. 1 ihave never been ill in my life!" ' " You ought to be very thankful for that, old girl ; but When did you find out that you were so unfitted to be my wife '{" " Oh, I don't know, Reggie. 1 ihave known it nil mlong. If you would only give it up we woiild "have enough to live on without t'be patients' ifc�. I would rather 'be a cockie's wife any day than a doctor's. You can't realise'how 1 'bate the idea !" " You know my ilteart is wrapped up in ?my work. Oi'ive, and 1 am the la^t person in the world <to get on with a selection. 

 I am not suited to it in the least. I am afraid you will have to be content with tlnings us flii'y are, if you mean iro marry me." " All�if !" sihe whispered under her breath, .hut lie 'hand her, and �his Shoulders 'with v sudden movement, and the hand which held his hurrting crqp tightened on 'tlhe cane. " If I am to get 'back to the township to-night I must be off," he Baid shortly. " It is so dark, but I expect old Brownie will pick Jiia way along the track safety. He ought to know the road wtill enough," lie add'sd more gcntily. " I wonder how much you reailly care �for me, 'Reggie," she said, slipping her itand his arm, as she came down ?tlhe stqpg and �>tood <beaide him. 'He touched her hair with IhU long, clever fingers. "My dear!" Ihe said, " My dear !" And the assurance in his ton?s flhov&l have 'been enough for her. But she was in a wayward mood to-night, ready to throw away "her 'lraippiness for a whim. "If you reailly oared," she answered, pouting, " you would give up your profes sion ifor my sake, when you know " "Olive! You ask too much!" She drew her ihand away angrily. " (jrood-night." she said, and turned to ascend the stops again. The di-cord^ni call of the bird "beyond �fclie lagoon came 'to tihoir ears arrdd the wind-'hiown rustlings of the scrub trees. He came up one step, and held out 'his arms to 'her. " Olive dear, give me one kiss before I go !" She i>aiu-ed on the top step, and, moving back a space, swept him. a mocking curstsey. " Doctor Gunning, you ask too anucih !" she said. As he closed 'the white garden gaibe be hind 'him, he told himself he trad done wJtfh women and Qoye for ever. " To ask me to give up my life's work for a whim�a silly school girl whim�a trick to try her power over the man ah� is engaged to. By heaven, it's .too bad !" And 'he strode away into the darkness, too angry 'to feel sorry yet. Inside the house ihs lefit behind 'him the girl crouched flow above the fire in the wide fireplace. It wa* a splendid fire ; a dog blazed .in ;the great antbrnl-dinci cavity, and xoaTed halfway up the c'hir mey. but she drew her thick *ihawi about her white shoulders again. " 1 am ohiUeJ �chitted <to the heart !" slie svud. � � � � � �From horizon to horizon the plain was white with moonlight. There was a hint of summer m the air�the soft carets she gives before t l:e claap of (her pas sionate arms has become &o close as to |be oppressive. It was a wide, tree'tes* plain, crossed only by a zigzag line of telegraph 

 poJes and the twisted ribbon of a buguy track, rutted by the la to parsing of some heavy waggon. At the base of one of the telegraph ijiole^. which had at -*ome titne been blacken-evi by 'tihe flames o>f a sweep ing bush ifire, lay w'bn't at first gCance np peart'd 'to he a ,l:ea.p of clicking, :bait w^liioli a sudden movement jvroved to be a human figure, prone on the hard, dusty ground. The figure of a woman in a hoHand riding �habit, "her fair hair fa.Uing to iher shoul ders. She moaned, and raising one hand to her head with quick feminine instinct, tried to -�et sitraig'lit tihe itumbded anaicsea 01 her hair, but, with a shu<lder, she dropped her arm again. " 1 wonder .how I got here ?" slhe said. A ?hundrefi^ffl^a^rav'^eo the other side ctf the!>^S,\\.:ft>ibrte':wiWi ihalf-turned saddWW^b'rtcire rein stHl hanging on his neckAvsKv.sed. JJer ;*jeye.s lighted wp. " X\\ffojikh<yQ(rEpmfr} You bolted with me ?njlvthc]^ thfctv nic, I suppo c, and olfl over\\'a^-bit of flying newspaper the teimsiei^ <liad, dropped in the road. It �war* tod twd of you, Bdb, and it wili put an end to my jovefly moonlight ride;� the on3y itihing I care about now. Father ?wifl never Bet me go out by myself again. 1 must have ibeen a wee bit stunned. Bob, come here, old fellow !" The horse pricked 'his ears 'but did not attempt to move -towards lier. Trying to lift herself she made a sharp exclamat on. " Oih, my foot, wihatever -w the matter with it. Oh, dear ! if I should dis out ihere all ailone !"' Two big -tears squeezed tibemselvei from under her eydidu. " i wish somebody wxmld come '." But there was no sound except ifor the crop, crap, of Bob's 'teeth, as :he /picked out the best of the scant grass the teamster's horces had Tef.t him. A little breeze sprang up .and shifted the diut in the road, and iplayed aoftfy on hex wliite face. �She >ay back and looked up at the stir*. How large was That inverted bowl men call the sky. The milky way threw a luminous bridge athwait the heaven =i, and one bright planet gjlowed and Shimmered ilow down in the arch. Now & faint rattle struck her oar, a elight vibra-tion seemed to stir the SttU night aL\\ Bob threw up hw head and 'listened nervously, then trotted a atep, whinnying flong and shrill. From the direction of the township a trap was evidently approaching. Olive raided her Ihead a little/ again, and cooed feebly. She made an effort to riso to her feet, but the universe reeled in a sickening fashion, and the pkun -wavered up and down the sky-line. The ground was unpleasantly hard to foiD back upon. " It doesn'it matter so much* if 1 do faint now," was iher last conscious thought. Tliere was a faint smell of drugs not unpleasant to her nostrils when slhe came to herself again. There was a cloth wet and cool on her head. She was liatf �lydng, half Bitting, on the seat of a moving vehicle, a man's strong arm supporting her shoulders. Something firm <bound her 

 ankle, and the .horrible ddtaclied^ feeing was gone. She opened her eyes. The man beside iher was driving care-fully with lua disengaged hand, his eyes tixed on Uie road aheak], whicrli ran like a brown ribbon along the telegraph polw. She laughed a OittJe hysterically, and noised her Ihead from hie ehmuMor. "It was funny �that you should (find mi*," she said. " Hello ! Ail right again ? He caroi'ul, don't move that ifotft ; steady now. 1 am just the Doctor; dent mind leaning on me !" " Thank you," faintly. " W!ha-a-t is the ma-t-t-er with tny foot ?" " Dkflocated ankle. Don't worry. It might have been woree. How did you come to be out Uiere all alone ?" " I have been taking moonlight rides lately. It was qu to date as a rulh. But I must 'have 'been 'thinking cf something else to-night and wasn't watching. Bab shies a little sometimes, and a bit of I>aper on the road " She began to cry, anid wa3 fain to bury her faoe on Ibis coait sleeve again. " Does it hurt very much ? Never mind. It is nrmfly bandaged. Fortunately ?I 'had both splinta and bandages with une. I was on the way out to Oaesidy'd eelsc tion to fix up young Oasa-dy's arm. Some drunken fool set it crooked, and 1 am afraid I shuil liave to :brcak it again. 1 couldn't get avvay from the township until late, but I will see you ihcunp tir�t. Isjb :bock as Tar as you can. 1 am sorry this <x>itfounded buckboard jcilts t?o, but I'M drive like a funeral." " What has become af any horse ?" she asked, the cool night breeze on her tear stained face reviving her a little. " I think the culprit is finding his way tome by some short cut he knows of ; but don't 'botiher about tihe villain. He doesn't deserve any eondkleration." " He didn't mean to do so much damage when he shied at a bit of newspaper, it was my faiult�l was thinking." " What were you thinking about V" lie asked, tightening his arm round 'her. She shut her eyes, and then, opening them wilfh a smile, turned [her face to him. " I was thinking that it waj more than two months since you came to sac me !" The horse was taking care of ihimsjlf. The ireina had fftipped from the Doctor's knees to the floor of the buefcboard, for �his arms were employed eil-ewliere. l^uckily Brownie was a quiet old nag, w*hom no flying papers or uncertain shadows couM turn .-from the even tenor of his way. Ho had often brought -his iformcr master, jv conviviaQ-mindcd squatter, 'home from the township fast iisleep in the covered buggy, or shouting hilariously to tihe sta�, so t2ie conduct of tbcxw behind him was a nta-ttcr of no moment, and he required no especiud guidance. As -for Olive, �he must have 'forgotten ell about her bandaged ankle, as she flifted her lips to Reggie's. " I don't think T shaft mind 'being q dootcur'a -wife, after all," ahre said.
