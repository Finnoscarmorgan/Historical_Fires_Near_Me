[ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.] The Fatal Treasure. A STORY OF THE BLACK FOREST. AN AUSTRALIAN TALE, BY IVAN DEXTER. CHAPTER XVII.-- Continued. "What ? Didn't you know that Bob Tre- vascus was murdered in the Black Forest by a wood-cutter and that the fellow was sen- tenced to death a couple of days ago for it." "Eh ! Trevaseaus murdered in the Black Forest ! What was he doing there ?" Hilton asked, with sudden interest. "No one knows what brought him there, and, the strangest part of it is, he had a lot of gold on him when he was killed, in bars and nuggets." "Gold in bars and nuggets !" the old man cried, springing to his feet with a fierce gleam in his eyes. "Where did he get the gold from ? Where did he get the gold, I say ?" " Don't got excited, Hilton," said the farmer, who thought the old man was in one of his peculiar moods. "No one is able to answer that question. He had none when he left here, so his brother says : and it's not to be supposed he had, because there is no gold around Carlesruhe such as nuggets and bars. Perhaps he robbed a miner," he concluded, with a laugh. "Robbed : aye, robbed ! that's what he must have done. He never cane by it hon- est.ly ; and he paiid the pt. nlty of his trench ery. When was lie hild.led' " Nearly tihr' weekls -ago. On \\-dhies day night furtnight, it is s:aid," :nssw; rd thei neighbor. "T\\rcduis:L3y nihtf" linise.d I iliii, witli a savage look in his eyes.

" O to day is as good as anot.her or ls hed as anlother, as the c-ase. Illmay be." "N' , they fire nolt," said ] iltri, fiercelv, " I tell yon WeVdesday is the unlucky day.

" Tie wh'ole accuut, of the triit, is in .this llonrnlin's pe r,1" said the neiglIhor, taking a Xlclbiurn, publlication out of his pocket iand hanudingit to hint.

"If he was not robbed the gold must be somewhere between the gully and the wood-cutter's hut. The wood-cutter's hut ?" he repeated, with a troubled expression on his face. "Where have I seen that hut ? It seems to me that I have known it in a dream, for somehow the place is familiar to me ; and yet I don't re- collect being at it. I must go to it and make another search. I can't stop away from that place now. It will haunt me until I am is the grave. Iu? I woni''t dio yet, not for a long time, for many and many a year," he muttered, with a look of avarice in the aged face painful to behold. "And they're going to Iciug a nialn for killing Trevascus .

The solitary dweller in thle hlut went inside and sat down by the fire-less ]iearthll. For hours hle remained there iintnovalde, and, at lengtlh, his minid being app:ireitly deidedi, lo weint outside aind lookedl up at the sky. "Not to-nlighlt, nsot to-night !' lio mnut tered, " for to-morrow will be Wednesdlay, and thimt is my unmlucky day. I imust wait nlother 2-4 hours and tlhen another .Scuarch for my stolen gold !" As some people, by constantlv repeating a lie, at last believe it, to be true, so, Hilton, by ever thinking of the stolen treasure, had come to regard it as his own rightful pro- pierty, interference with whichi being ai rme'ini to be piunishied \\vith dealth. The loss of it had dtriven himi tnimportrrily ins:lne, and for a couple of dlays lie ihad wandered through the bush without food; 'butl starvation, which will tame ai wild beast--aand ia ]lnl:ii being in tx:tt condition is little better---broughlt himi to his senses ligail, and after ia lengtlhy sehiour for the boxes lie roetunied lunsuccess ful and broken hearted to his home at Carls- ruhe.

Verily, it was seeking for a ineedle in a bIuldle of straw. 

 CHAPTER XVIII. CHANCE OF DESTINY. It is a moot point whether Chance or Des- tiny control human affairs. Perhaps the two words mean the same, and events which are really set down to chance have been predes- tined front all time: If man be a free agent it appears very curious that his whole life should be swayed and shaped by some chance event which he never expected nor wished for ; yet, if we trace back the devious road of human life we will invariably find that the straight path on which we started out from our cradle has it some panrt or another been suddenly blocaked by some chance obstacle, :ind our course turned off at a tangent. Sometimes we :Ihave nearly passed all the milestones on the journey of lif.: before this turning point is reached. whilst; frequently we are hardly out cf sight of the cradle before we are called upon to travel along a path very different from that mapped out for itS. - We are blini gropers in the d:rk. We cannot see tihe distance of our nose ahead with certainty, and every step forward we give leads us.fromn the light of t.hq present to the darkness of tlm fut ure. No mnian can say what the morrow will be, and, cl:ince or destiny, which e-er you like to call it, rules our life. John JHilton was a striking instance of Ihis assertion. It was cither destiny or chan:tce that threw him in the way of Mhaguira the bu:shranger, at the "Travellers' est"'' slanlty, and the impulse which moved himn to assist the attacked man was responsible to a great ex tent in shaping his future life. 3fa:.uire's well-meant present was to hint a fatal gift in the end, for it disturbed the clear and serene current of his life a:wl lilled lUe period of his declinilg years with troitle anld gloom. Previous to the possession of the paper giving a clue to the buried treasure Hilton was an easy-going, contented miail. Amiidst flhe all-abshrbing fever of the e:arly gold disxovesries, lie was content to reall:iil oil his little farm it Carlsruho whilst others were miadly I:pkiiig up :*rd seanup'erimg away to the " diggings,' and it wais nearly 10 years after the first excitement had died away that (more for a change them fr0m any motives of averice) he decided to pay a short visit to Bendigo and try his luck at fossicking." It was on this ill-stlarred jour:ney that. the inouientous event of his life occurred,and the c, tinteed old man was tra,'iormd into a restless', unhappy miser. Froin the day he left the "'' Travellers' k-.st " he never knew what it was into lave a contented niiid. -le spent his waking innmo ments in day-dreams and his sleep was visi ted with gorge.ous visions of unhounded wetlthil. Ic had the P'hilosohdcr's t1(imi, so lie thought, in the blood-stained package the dying man had given him; and the golden direams of Ihis youth woulld le reali:sed. Like the Israelites in the desert, when MoI�s: left. them, hle ceased to, worship the true (Goid ani set up for himself a graven im age of gold anu, like them, his pmliiiushment w:is swift auid ;severe. For a weary year lhe searcel nmsu-cess fully for the iuried treasure, nnd whenu he fotiund it in the strutni e mnanmer he did- whlienh the.fi.ry-cross shlone lbefoie hisi eyes in the depth of the night-- it was only to lose it the same day, and in a most unaccountable uniumer. Twice suince tlh:t miseralblt. d.ay he lhad again visited thie place where he hdul di covered the gold, and spent day.s in vwainily .reirhing for it. Now, 12 miuntlis after his first discovery- and loss--ie was again camped in the narrow glen known as "Stringy-bark Gully.," bent upon another search after the gold which he still fancied must re buried somewhere in the neighborhood. He had pitched a small tent in the glade where be h lir:st camped and, as the sun was sinkim;ng in tihe west, he sat with bie-cd head in froit of a ldazing fire ihe had im:ade and looked at the embers as if lie would again tiid inspira;tiion in their fiery char.cters. )Day disappeared and the long shiadows be mciiie merg, ed in the general gloom, and still the white-h:aired old man sat with bent head and folded. arms gazing intently at the fie. As the nighit wore on he begangi to talk aloud,as if lie were addressing an unseen com " The gold is minie i ? he nitterld. "Yes, mini'. I must find it. Where can it be, . wona.er ? Tahut a fool I was to leave it as I di,1. I might h:,ve ]known it wais nio safe to go aw:s:y ftr a momenit frcom sucih a1 prize; ulit I awill iird it yet..

As he fiiish.dg t:ilking he glainced ri-proach fully at the it; liing logs, as if otfi'ndled at t!hii not su-.n "estiig tlhe where:aboutls ,of the lost treasure, and then hle stood up and went into the ten;. As the first hfieak of dawn broke in the east hle was :s:;lir and, �ufter lprep:ring a rough breakfast, iie wsalked rouid thei tent in an uimtertain nnumuir two or three timies and then stood and roltle:ted. "The ,:ack of the tent, which was cut li-own,," he said uloul, " faced this way, so tld thieves muist have taken the gold dout that way, and moust likely they carried it further into thelo f.rest. They coulddn't live- re-buried it in tlhe-iully,- so I will tl'ed this dirietion to-day and tr iy ny luck," h coiecluded,look ing to the 'nortlh and in the very direction the gold hadl :etun:illy been take-n. With el:ager eyes ]e tciarfultly asel'ended tihe steephlill, scalniiig the ground iit nstniuite ly. IHe reac-hed the top iani des-endeed into the iexlt guilly,looking into every thicket and w-atlching for the least signs of disturbed earth. :On lie awent, with the p.rtiunacity of a sleuth-hoiiud, and almost with thet snine in stiijct. -Ile pissed l.y the cultivated gruunu, on Sheri:dan's fa:rm anud round thci lase of the Round IHill anid int, a deep glen on the oither side. This damrk ravine looked a likely place for " phlant," ie thoughlt, and hie exaiiiied it withl the greatest cnre. Ile was going ca utiously- thruilih somei thick scrub wshelnhe nearly stumibled into.a hole whicih was almnost hiidcin by the long rank grass and luxtiriant creepers. S. ving hilmsi:lf with difli-iity, he got a long stick and,. parting the v,,getation which coveredl the hiol,, tried to aseert'iu, its depth. IHe fouldl it was not more than three feet deep, -nd it h.ls evideitly been formed by the up-rootiug of a large trot, which hlid silnCe Ii.ei destryeild ,y the inineroiis bush fires. Using thei stick v-igorously, hec broke away most of thie grass and creepers and then, kneeling down, struck a match to explore the excavation~, the thick uiindergiowth envel op'ed it in glouii. For a few m uiints he could distiuguish niothiuig, u- t at l:st his eyes risteil o'i a slight pLrultriberunc at the bottom of .the hole on oiln. side. HLe took iup the stic.k :and liegan pokinmg at it, andi iln a fcai momients hel felt souimethiig iu"rud uiider the soft earth. With a sligit gleam of interest lighting up hisi hag gardl fce, the ol man s'iopeld aw:iy the debris, aid as he did so hle f.ouid tiha:t the object ]ie was feeling, awhatever it might bue, was wbodein. A few miore tlr'usts with tIhe stickl: midl the square outliues of a box bac:nme v-isible iand, unable to control his excitniemnt, Hilftin jumped into the hole with an agilily beyoind his years. With a suppressed cry of terrior hle clam bered out again with lightning-like rapidity, just in time to avoid the dart of an enraged 

 s:n-ik,.s which resented interference with its home. SWih be Ids of parspir.tioln on his face at the narrow escap hel hald had, for the rept ile was of the tiger species an-I most veo:lloons; Hilton stood for a fw seconds to recover hilnself and then, seeing a larg.e stoule a few yards away--for heI colld not use the sticki effectively in the iole, he picked it tp auil, waiting his oppo'rtunity, d:.-:hdi it down on the snake, breaking its b:r:k. This do:e, he had little difileulty in d,_sp. t-hing ii t out right. Carefully examining lthi hole, to mal: sure the dead raptill had ni-oiinpaions,the anl - ons mlt again descenlded :Irl, quic:kly scirap ingaway the earth, he g:ive a will cry of joy, as he saw before himon oul rci th , mi.ssing. treasure boxes, which he knew so iweal, for they were graven on hi:; m'.mory. The revulsion of his long'-pnt-up feelings was so great that hi becamne faint and, drop ping heavily oi tie box, he' remainctd mo tionless for a fiull half-hour, with his fixed :ind. st:aii;g eyes looking on the snake, which still shot-ed somle eigns of life. CIhAPTER XIX 'PI[E lil(INTI.fNG O' TII1E END. - As lie gradually recovereal his strength he lifte:l out Ithe,box, whi-ch hal.apparently not lei:t covered in the first inst.:nuee, but con eca;ed bly the loose earth whlil:h fell in from the sils of tihe hole,, and' placed it on the surf:ce. Then, getting a sharp stick, he ro:,ted a:ltboitt in :1al directions in search of the oiller bixes, but without fildilng any trace of.tiihlti. 'Wrear(y with his exertions and the emotion ,f thus :iuiadily recoverinig part. of- the'lost treasure, which ie ]had: coni to regard as his own prop-rlty, lie sat down bside the box and examlined it. I [ ftunll that it lhad Incon broken open, for a 1,pitc of tle woo,;l caie away easily when lI touched it,: and lihe fioud that a sual:l pirtion of Ithe contents had been taken, for the box wsnuot'qiluit.e full. lie then began to tlieo-is, as to how the gIll c:ane there and who haid taken it flo:n hiiii.

Ah, that is it," ]i' cx claimel, as hl, looked in a nei'thl r iy dire.tionll and saw the hark roof of a hit Ithrli,- h the trees, ahbout 0 yards distait.

Go'ing back for the box, lie ro-entercq the hult and, after closing the door, placed it on t!hi routgh table which .still remnaiied in 'the rooin. In : few niuiites lie went outside again anm carefully surveyed the surrounding locality, to see if a:nlone might be about. As hlie alked round the. lhut it seemed. str:iangely familiar to him. " I halve ne\\ver leen here before arid yet I seem to know the place," lie aiid. [Hilton hadl been at the hut before, but it will occur to the reader that ihe wa; in a slate of teupobrary insanity, -which clouded his memory so far as soiue of the incidents which occurred on the night when he lost the gold.] Going to ;a smn:all wiidow in the side lhe looked in and saw the box on the table quite distiictly. SI mlust l:,ve': seesn this :ouise in my dreams, for even this wiidw I reco:,lle:t. Why should tlli p1lce seeii so familiar to men? It's an omiin of either giiol or ill," said the sllpersititious lanu, " aidt it mist be fitr giiod, because miy hisik is ii til-d:i y. If it was \\Wed inis'lay, ilow : Ah W Tcediiesday ! that is imy evil day !" Muttelring like, this, Hilton passed roumd the louse unti hlie camne to the "lean-to.' Findiing th:it emptuy, and thile doorway covered with cobwebs? hli: felt secure from intrusion and cwent into the lhouse. Taking oiff the loose piece fri.a the box, ihe at once commenced to stow the gold l:bout his lplerson in the most convenicent manner. Findii-ng ; piece of strong canvas in one of the former Ibh-roons, with thle help of sonme stringi which he ecirried h. m: made a .0rough sort of biag which woidd be easier to carry thi;n thie heavy box, and would not attract attentlon. After ii!lil'ng!all his pockets aud plalcing some inside the ,re:ast of his shirt, hl mnuin :lgel to pi:lk the ieSt into the ,:hg. I I will burn this box," lie said, " and th:ot wiU rcmi-,v' a possibc danger of dis cr'very." I1e gathered up' some rtbbish from the fluor aud, br.-akinig up the now useless bult lately mutl-souotght-after box,; he placed it iu the .iopl:ce aind apphlied a: miatchl. There was an soll stol' in the room and, dlrawing it inear tlhe blaze, le s:at dowwn.--fceling lumore secure-to rest, for he felt quite worn out. The loig sea:luh after the gold, with tho restless, sleepless nights "nd iuglect of food, had greatly sapped the old imal's strength. 1fe was, iu fact, hurrying himstlf to the griave as fast as he could, Like mauiny others who thirst for wealth, hie was goilng the way that led to the grave, land in the cuid would fild, like so man;iy do, that in grasping at the substance hel had missed it, and found instead the shadow of deaith. As lie sat before the cherful blaze-the onily cheerful object about---hle fell inito a fit fisl slumber, with tlhe blag of gold clasped in his ri'lit hoid. On the edge of the clearing which s?r rotmded the hut andl facing the doorway, an evil-looking mai-ho was nuic otler than Gerald Armiytige, who w': on t a visit to Sheiridan'.s farm'ii the vicinitny--had watc!hed Hilton wallc;ig round the holuse ;mnd exanisn ing the locality. '" W' hat the miisehief is that fellow doing there ? le seems to be up to somiethiig," said the crouchding mi:i. As HIiltoin ent:rid the hut "nd closed the door Armytage rose from his hiding-place and, making a detour, went round the scrub until he came to the back of the hut.
