 CHAPTER X. 

 Continued. 

 After tea Johnny turned into a bunk the cook had made for him by the kitchen fire, and was soon asleep. 

 Mr. Attenbrough looked at his sleep- ing guest, who lay as one dead, threw another rug over him, put wine, biscuits, and a lantern near him, and left him for the night. He rose at dawn, but Mr. Armstrong was before him, and was coming over the paddock with his hat full of eggs that he had found. 

 "Good morning, Mr. Armstrong; I did not care to wake you last night, but 

 now let me offer you a change of cloth- ing or anything else you need." 

 The clothing was accepted, a good bath enjoyed, and the eggs eaten, and Arm- strong stretched himself on the couch for a talk. Attenbrough showed him the size of his lease, and then their con- versation turned to sheep. 

 "How did you get along with the blacks in your travels?" said Mr. Atten- 

 brough. 

 "I had only my black boy with me, but they never attempted to molest me, and I never took any more notice of them than if they were kangaroos." 

 Next morning they rode round the run and discussed the best class of sheep, Mr. Armstrong making his new friend some good offers, with plenty of advice. Mr. Attenbrough greatly ad- mired his companion, whose massive head, with its coal-black curly hair and 

 long jet beard, gave him a distinctive 

 appearance. He was evidently quick to decide and abode by the decision. The natives he kept about him were never deceived, and they served him well. The tribes never thought of calling his word to account nor disobeying his 

 orders. 

 The two men rode home in silence, and went early to rest, and in the morn- ing the horses were shod, and then the squatter rode off; but just before saying goodbye be put a piece of paper into Attenbrough's hand to give to the men in the kitchen. To their delight the paper, badly written and worse spelt, 

 was an order on the bank for �20. 

 When Dr. Drummond reached Mount Yatna the very first person he saw was Milmilty. "Where is 'Bottle-brush'," asked the doctor. 

 "That one devil catch him ; Pocum- bidnies got him ; plenty devil sit down long your place." 

 "No, Milmilty, there may be Mul- darbies and Pocumbidnies, but they never took the boy, and you know who did, and helped to plan it. I told you he was to be sent away, and that is why he is carried off so soon. The very first time you are caught at Tindora I wil tie you to a tree and thrash you till you tell me." 

 The family of Winstanly received the doctor very kindly, but when later he overheard Mr. Stevenson talking to Elsie he was greatly disturbed. He was telling her that when his house was finished she must come over and see it. "Karobie" was to come, too, and dear old housekeeper would receive them. 

 One day the doctor said to Stevenson, "I wish you would come back with me. I feel sure trouble is hanging over us with the darkies. Mr. Winstanly hear- ing the remark, agreed with them and decided to go too. 

 Ill at ease the doctor was, and the three hastened off with their pistols, but two long summer days must pass before the station or rather the hills round it 

 could be reached. When they did sig- nals of smoke rose from far away one after the other. Not a bush fire this time but an indication that several 

 tribes of natives were about. Pushing on, they came within a few miles of their destination, and dead sheep lay about; on to the hut; but no one there; on again to the home paddock. The kitchen thatch roof was gone; several natives were attacking the store. Down they dropped and fired. The natives were soon overpowered, and the men rushed to the store to see how their 

 friends fared. Mr. Attenbrough was there with his arm in a sling, but other- wise well. Mr. Stevenson had received a spear wound in the calf of his leg. 

 Old Jones' son said he went out with the flock yesterday while his father stayed to cook. He was bringing the sheep home at sunset and a party of natives met him. They were very friendly and spoke a little English; at least, one did. He said "all right, Johnny, plenty supper long a camp oven." It was quite dark, and he won- dered why his father did not come out to help him yard the sheep. He went in and struck a match. There was a fire lit on the camp oven, and when he lifted the lid there lay his father's head chopped off with the axe, and looking round there lay the headless body on the floor. The boy fled out into the darkness of the night and came part- way here, but was overcome with fear and broke down. He lay on the ground till daylight, and then came on. Just as he was telling us the tale a yell was heard, and a hundred or more rushed on us, and we fled to the store. 

 A few blacks were brought in with dog chains about their necks, and a pair of them were hung. The natives disappeared, but left behind them a trail of fire�grass, scrub, forest, all ablaze. Never in after years 

 did those white men see such another. For days and weeks the great tree 

 cracked and fell. Many acres of open country appeared after that. The birds flew to the water. Happily before the shifting winds could fetch it round to the other side, torrents of tropical rain fell. The men gathered up the dead bodies and burnt them, rounded the scattered sheep and cattle, and found 

 their loss considerable. 

 Time would heal the losses. The 

 spear wound in Mr. Attenbrough's arm soon healed, but the mark bore testimony all his life to a conflict with wilderness of Australia. 

 Mr. Stevenson went wounded down 

 to Adelaide to be made a great fuss of by the ladies of society, who thought 

 him a hero. 

 Mrs. Ah Sin would not go back to the shepherd hut again, so her husband was brought back once more to be cook. The boy whose father was murdered came to live at the station, and after wards went to work for Mr. Winstanly, where, strange to say, he took much to the natives and their ways, being more with them than the white folks at Yatna.
