 'CHAPTER V.� (Continued.) 

 - There -were a few lights visible 011 the main land, and one or two on the island far distant in the Bay� bush fires probably, most of them. Tor another quarter of an hour the silence was unbroken, for Stoneham 

 rarely spoke to the girls except to give orders, and as. usual sat wrapped in meditation *nd tobacco smoke. Soon, however, the steamer had passed south. ' Set the fore sail and spanker.' The yacht, as we have stated, car ried two tall masts that night, but so rigged that the second could, if neces sary, be easily unshipped. Both masts carried large square lug sails and span kers with top sails. It was easy to see that the Gadfly had been built for speed. 'With the propeller at full power she could show her heels to any craft upon 

 the .bay ; in lact walk round and Jaugn at them. She was soon bowling along at a great rate with the white foam heaped up in front of her bows, and an eddying wake behind, for it was nearly high water, and although Stone . ham was keeping fairly in shore he knew that there was plenty of water 

 everywhere and no risk 01 running aground ; she was making at least fourteen knots. The moon was hang ing low down in the west, but the stars were bright in iront of them and they could see that the bank of clouds, which was now rapidly sweeping up in their rear, formed a very curious spectacle. ? The background of the sky was black as ink; but stretched right across, from horizon to horizon, was a great bridge or bow of white clouds. The chain and forkedlightning flashed brilliantly at the back of it and reflected occasionally through it like the flash ing of opals ; but the white bridge of vapour showed no perceptible move meat for several minutes as though it 

 was fixed across the sky. Then there came a brilliant flash which lit up the whole Bay, and a peal of thunder quickly followed and the fantastic creation melted before the pent-up fury of the storm. ' Lower away and furl the spanker.' The girls stood by in readiness, expecting the order, and obeyed it with astonishing alacrity. They seemed as nimble as highly-trained seamen, and had two reefs in each of the big sails before the storm struck them. ' It seemed for a moment as though it 

 would take the masts right out of her, although she was being driven by the propeller at full speed and Stoneham put her dead in front of the wind. She shivered, and seemed to leap for ward as the full force of the gale caught her, but it was only for a brief minute or -two when it rushed past howling and screeching like some band of mad furies convulsed with rage. It was just such a brief minute or two as has wrecked many a fine vessel upon the high seas. Their course was altered after pass ing the light house on Blue Nose point, and they ran on for another half-hour ; after which they furled the sails and cast anchor under the lea of an uninhabited island not far from the mouth of the Brisbane Eiver. ' You can turn in for an hour,' said Stoneham to the girls; which they took to be his polite way of tell i ng them thai something was about to transpire which they had best know as little about as possible. 

 CHAPTER VI. moniham's girls. It might be tnought, from the little less than brutal way in which Stone ?^ . ; ham habitually treated his family) that * ^ his wife and the girls would have been thoroughly cowed and their spirits broken. But this was far from . being 

 the case. Use is second nature, and as Dorna put it they were very much 1 v used to the old man's ways. And they were certainly very peculiar. Before a man like. Hartley, with / whom he had' reasons for keeping on ?-\\_ , good terms, he would be as smooth spoken to the girls, as though he were 5' , only a bit strict in his treatment of j'~*. them. He would even tolerate, on jt/Jv '. rare occasions, visitors of the better �&'-'- class like Captain Buchanan and Sir r,V; ' , Jharles Dawson, and would even (f ' smoothly hint in a confidential sort of f. , way that he would like to see some o J''--^' - elder girls comfortably married ; but �$K/ ke never tolerated anything which p^v - interfered with their workj and when ?�/? - ' nine-o'clock came visitors' boats were g�-'-- always ready, and Stoneham would f�� - - stalk gravely into the best parlour with ICv'. ^, a big hat stuck on the back of his i?X ''^/head, and sit down stiffly upon a chair ?=sf~; .?* until the guests took the hint that it 

 �V ?was-timeto leave. t- '- j ' A Presbyterian minister who called ;-S / / at the Island twice a year to see if : ' ' there were any fresh girl babies to be !,�;.- ' baptized, was the only male, besides �_' , the aged schoolmaster previously re 'i';v*l f erred to, who was ever allowed to ?'�-'''. sleep upon the island � that is with %:?:- ,~ Stoneham's knowledge. Jn&V - If the old man was 'on the square,' isf* '\\ -as the girls said, he posed before the '&? '-' Minister as a true blue son of the old c�V Scotch Kirk, and boasted that the j&'- r' best Scotch Presbyterians hailed from i|K': thevNorth of Ireland; but if he 

 happened to be ' on the cross,' he was only allowed time for a meal aud a prayer, and had to find other lodgings on the mainland. But the girls had a lot of their father's spirit, and as they grew up' ho found it Avasn't exactly safe to knock them about much. They gave, him to understand that ho might possibly go 

 too far and there were, at any rate, four of them wholjwere getting to be tall! and fairly muscular women. ; ' You: touch me if you dare,'' said Marjory to him one doy when be started to thrash her with his .riding, whip, for being absent from some farm work which he had given her to do. 'Curse you, you slut,' he called out in a towering rage, as, white with anger, he was about to rush forward and strike her. ??.-..?? ' ^Bes's,' called, out the girl to, a vounger sister, who stood trembling 

 near them,. ' go' -tip- and call mother.' She had a loaded rifle in her hand, for she had been away to shoot . nil eagle-hawk which had been after the voung turkeys, and she stepped back 

 as Stoneham drew near her. . Just before he hit her, he seemed for the first time to catch sight of the rifle. The muzzle of it pointed straight at his right leg, the girl's finger touched the trigger, and there was a. very awkward look in her eyes. The man suddenly drew back, and called upon Bess, who by this time had scrambled straddle-legs upon ' Lucifer ' and was cantering up toward the home stead for her mother. . ' ' Come back, you fool.' ' What did you send your sister, up to the house for your mother for ?' he asked. 

 ' So that she might help to dress your broken leg,' said the girl, looking defiantly at him. ' Do you mean to say you would shoot your father ?' 'You put that, riding whip across my shoulders and you will see. I'm a woman now.' He swore about it, and at his wife 

 too, for the way in which she was bringing up the girls. But if the truth was known he rather liked her pluck, and boasted afterwards to a settler on the mainland, that the girls would as soon shoot a man as look at him, if he wasn't pleasant. But he only threatened Majory once after that with his riding whip, and that was the day she disappeared. However, the girls 'were born and reared to it ; and were cheerful enough when they got away from the presence of Stoneham. ? They had made a tennis court for themselves, and were skilled in gutting 

 out of the old man's way for a bit of recreation. 'They even flirted with the old schoolmaster, to whom they said their lessons � and a good many other things � during the winter months. Then there was the muster ing to do, ond the girls' laughter as they raced madly after a mob of young bullocks, and the crack of tlieir stock whips, and the clatter of their horses' hoofs, when they came on to the bit of (Travel at tho yards, sounded de 

 cidedly healthy. For one thing they lived well. They could scarcety help it, for tlieir mother sought to forget the disappointment of her marriage in good housewifery, and there was besides plenty of fresh meat, fish in abundance, and an oyster bed on the rocks to the west of the creek, and milk, and butter, and fruit ; ia fact a rough and ready abundance of all good things, and a healthy wholesome appetite to enjoy them. ' If we only had a different father,' said Dorna, one day to the girls and her mother, ' Smoke Island would not be so bad.' ' Mother ' she said ' why ever didn't you marry a different kind of man.' ''Ah! you don't know what your father was like when he came courting. I could have married ever so many nice men, and well to do, but you see 'somehow I loved Aaron Stoneham.' And then the kindly-hearted woman would heave a sigh. ' Well, I am sure I wish you had married one of the other nice men,' said Alice. ' As it is I don't know what's to becomt of us. Mr. Stone ham has got the worst character of any man in the colony, and his daughters are talked about every where as the' ' seven Smoke Island girls.' I shall run away some night, and ask the first man I meet on the mainland to marry me, if it is only to be known by another name.' But it would take many chapters to describe the family life of the Stone hams, and how the girls occasionally did the old man, so we must come back to where we left the master of the Gadfly on board his craft waiting 

 for some one near the entrance to the Eiver Brisbane, It must have been fully two hours after they had cast anchor, when at last the dip of muffled pars was heard near at hand. A boat with one. man in it shortly after emerged from the darkness, and almost noiselessly glided up under the stern of the Gadfly. Stoneham stood up and without a word of greeting placed a longish par cel into the boat, and stepped into the stern sheets, as she slipped away again into the night. 'Did you see who it was V whis pered Alice to Dorna.' 'Yes,' answered her sister quietly and cautiously. ? ' Who was it then ?' ' Captain Buchanan.' ' Whatever can he want with the 

 old man ? ejaculated Nettie, for all three of them were as wide awake as possible. ' Nothing I fear that's any good,' replied Dorna. The girls peered into the darkness in the direction which the boat had taken ; but the only sounds were those of the wind and water, ?- or the occa sional cry of a curlew, or other night bird. ' 

 ' Vo you tmnk it would : be safe for us to standin nearer to the land V said Alice. * ?''?-. ' We should have to go dead slow, for fear of getting on a sand bank,' re-: plied Dorna, who was captain in her father's absence. They had taken off their oilskins, for the rain had passed over some time before, and in their blue guernseys, short skirts, and sailor caps, were quite warm enough, for the night was still close although the storm had somewhat cooled- and cleared the atmosphere. ??: ?' 'Stand by to get up the anchor,-' said Dorna to her sisters as she switched the power on so as to niove the Gadfly ahead. 

 me lnacnmery or the yacht was so arranged that both engine and helm could bo attended to if necessary by one person. So they soon .had the anchor up and were moving cautiously across in tbe direction of the river. All at once they heard the sound as of men quarrelling and exchanging blows in the distance. It seemed to be somewhere upon the bay however. ' They are fighting in the boat,' said Alice. 'I don't think so, 'said Nettie 'listen!' | The three girls listened and distinctly heard the crunching as of shells be neath their feet. ' It's dead low water,1' whispered Dorna, ' and they're fighting on one of the sand banks.' [To be Continued Next THUKSDAy.] \\
