Children's Corners 

 A Holiday Adventure. 

 CHAPTER IV. 

 By "Delphia." 

 After looking at the burning tree for some time, Harry said: "Would you be frightened, Mary, to walk with me to that tree, it is only 

 About a mile away. * Fancy If we only bad fire to cook with how nice the yams would be, and the oysters." " Yes," said Mary, " and we might catch one of those little piggy-wiggies. How nice some moat would taste after being so long without." "Well, Mavy, then let-us *fart at once t It is early yet, because the sun is not high up in the sky. We can have a long rest when we reach the tree." The children had now been seven days on this island ; seven days since they were swept out to sea, away from their home and their parents. But they did not despair, they still hoped on, and every night and every morning asked Hod to watch over them, apd bring them safely hqnte again. Harry marked the days with stones. There was a long, smooth rock near the cliff. .Every night when the suu went down he put a stone on the ledge. That was an other day gone by. Drinking the milk from a fresh cocoa nut, and eating the tender white inside, Harry and Mary prepared for an exploring walk to the burning tree. I must tell you, though, that cocoanuts when they arc young and green arc very different from those hard things children.,buy in fruit shops. The white part of the green nut is soft and creamy and very wholesome. The storm of the previous night must have been a violent hurricane ; largo trees lay about, torn up by the roots ; palm trees had been blown flat r and two of the old dry trunks of trees looked as if they had been struck by lightning. How fortunate for Harry and Mary that they bad found shelter in that cave! It made them feel that the good God was taking care of and watch ing over them all the time. The smoke of the burning tree was still visible every time there was au opening in the 

 scrub fit rose up 'high into the sky, like a column. '��;?�?.* � >... ..... Birds' of brilliant' phuuage .flitted' about among the vines and shrub* ;� some "were not much larger than bjg* bees; their breasts were emerald green and their heads ruby-red, and they hacl\\ long pointed beaks, which they pushed into the waxliko flowers. ' "I think those ore humming birds^' said Mary, "or honey bird*" ??> " I have my ' shanghai,' " said Harry; " I am going to have a shot at them.' r But Mary could not bear the thought of killing any living thing, especially those lovely harmless little birds, and Harry would not vex his slater. In deed, since they had been cast on this strange land they seemed to love each other more, and Harry never thought of teasing his sister as he did at home. I am sorry to say he had often made her cry, slapping her dolte, putting their eyes out, and using them for " Aunt Sallies" when she wns away. Rustling about in the dry leaves and undergrowltb were golden pheashjttts; Mary was lost in amazement at their beauty. Ringdoves fluttered amongst the trees, diamond sparrows and finches of every kind hopped from twig to twig. They seemed so tame, not at all frightened of Harry and Mary. After walking hall'-a-mile the child ren came upon a creek. The water was rushing down very fast, dashing over rocks, raaklug little waterfalls. " I believe this creek comes 4(own from the big mountain we saw in the distance," Harry said. " Let us rest, and play with the bubbling water." They took off their boots and socks, sat. on the rocks, and let the water rush over their tired feet. Very re freshed they felt after bathing their sunburnt faces*and hands. On the bank three native companion birds stalked about on their thin, long legs ; farther down the creek two beautiful white cranes were fishing and flapping their wings ; & small turtle raised its head out of the water to see what the world was doing, brilliantly coloured butter flies as large as sparrows poised on tbo reeds and branches, and the air was filled with the cry of birds. "I should like to live herel," Said Mary." "tou would not like to lite here when the hurricanes blow," Harry re plied. " What a safe shelter we had In our cave. Let He try and get to the burning trees. The file seems to be spreading." Half-a-mile more, through tangled scrub and over huge trunks of fallen trees, and they came to the flre. The lightning must have struck one of the dry old giant trunks and set it alight, but now that the hot sun was drying the surrounding foliage the fire w�8 spreading. Seising a burning branch, Harry gave it to hjis sister, and, picking up a thick hollow branch which was burning at one end for his own burden, they made their way back to the creek, watching their burning branches as they sped along. It was terrible hot work, and the poor children nearly fainted by the way. At last the creek was reached, and, crossing over, they � threw their burning branches among some dry rocks, and, piling up more fuel to keep them alight, they threw them selves down under a shady tree to rest, panting from the heat and exertion. "What shalL we do. Harry, if that bush fire covers the land ?" said Mary. " It can't cross the creek, Mary, and we will be very careful with our fire; If we can only carry enough to keep alight on the way, wo will make a fire down among tho rocks, near our cavern, and keep plenty of logs an<\\ fuel near, so as to keep It burning always," Picking up their thick burning branches, and carefully putting out tho rest with water that Harry carried to and fro in his hat, the children after much toil arrived at the cavern. Care fully descending the cliff, they found a hollow Bandy place surrounded by. rocks. Here they placed what was left of the burning branches, and quickly, looked around for more fuel to keep the fire alight. All along the beach dry. kelp and sea-wrack were strewn. Sea wrack Is that long brown seaweed that is thrown up by the sea in great storms. This answered the purpose splendidly; but to. make sure that the flre would not go out during the night, Barry, ascended the cliff again and rolled down several old logs that were lying about. After much exertion these were placed over the burning kelp ; then they felt certain of their flre for the night. Conij pletely exhausted, the children went back to their cavern, and slept (till morn ing. (To be continued.) .
