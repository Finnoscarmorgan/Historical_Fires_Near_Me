CHAPTER XIX. * 

 �s Mrs. Wcst�nloj. liarL �o�d .Gerrard inlier letter that she' and �fary-would liot le�v� Marumbah -for quite two. .months and proceed^direct.to Somerset, where she hoped he w��ld ineet them, he de- cided^ to lose uo Dior� time at Port Deni- son ; and so a week .after the abandon- ment of Frazer's Gulley, lie and his friends fouiid themselves on board a steamer -bound to the most northern port of the colony, just then coming in- to p^nyin�iice :as tho rendezvous of the peaHing fleet/ although Thursday Is laud was much more favoured. 

 Before leaving Port Denison, he had written to his sister, and told uer that ho would meet her on her arrival at Somerset. "Jim is off his head with* de- light," he added ; <;in fact we both are at the prospect of seeing you and Mary so soon. In one way I am glad that it will be barely three months before you get to Ocho" Rios, for I want to get a new house put up; the present one isn't of much account"-this was his modified way of saying that there was no house there at all, it having been re- duced to ashes, but he did not wish her to haye the faintest inkling of any of his misfortunes, for fear that �he would 

 then refuse to add to his troubles and 

 expenses by becoming a charge upon him. "Ana I have already bought some decent furniture, which I will take round with me in one of the pearlers. I do hope you will like the place but you Sill look upon it at its very worst, for 

 1�re have been heavy bush fires all about thc station, which have, played the deuce with the countrv for hun- dreds of miles about. But the annual rains will begin to fall in four months, and then you will sec it at its best. I am also going to make a garden, and plant no end of vegetables and flowers and things. There is a lovely little spot on one or the creeks, and Jim and I have been going over a thumping big. box of seeds which I bought yesterday. You can consider that garden as made, with rock-melons and water-melons, and 'punkens' and other fruit growing in it galore." 

 When Elizabeth Westonley read the 

 letter she smiled-the first time almost since her husband's death. "How nice of your uncle, is it not. Mary ? I should miss a garden dreadfully, and it is very thoughtful of him -when he has so much work to do with his cattle. And see, lie has sent me a draft for one hundred pounds for our expenses up to Somer 

 Set." " " ' 

 ''Are we very, very poor now, AuntP" "Very, very poor, marv," �nd she sighed. "But still it might have been much worse for us if the people to whom Marumbah now belongs bad not let me keep the furniture. Mr. Brooke has bought it, and paid me three hundred and fifty pounds for it. And I am sure he only did it because he was sorry for us t I am certain he does not want it." ' Brooke, indeed, had been very kind to the wife of his dead friend, and had tressed "her to accept a loan of money, 

 ut this she had gratefully declined. 

 "Howdied Uncle Tom must be that he has money to send you''* _ v 

 "I am eure he must be. He is always thinklug �f others ; and you and . L I Mary, must do all we can for him. I 

 shalt be housekeeper and cook and all sorts of things, and you shall be chief ! housemaid, and help me, and we will try 

 and make the house look nice." 

 "Yes, Aunt. And won't it be lovely to se� Jim again! I can-just imagine Iiis staring eyes when he sees that I 

 lave brought Bunny. You'll keep it a I dead secret, won't you " 

 "Quite secret. I did not even men- tion Bunny in my letter. Now we must go on sewing these mosquito cur- tains ; your unole says that in the rainy season the mosquitoes nearly eat ono alive, so I am going to make six, as I 

 am sure he has none at Ocho Rios. He 

 says they don't bite him, as his skin is 

 top tough." 

 �ff 

 j An hour before the steamer in which 

 Gerrard and the Frazers had taken pas 

 [ sage cast off her lines from the jetty, Laoejr came on board tc say farewell, bringing with him Mrs. Woodfall. The kind-hearted woman was almost on the verge of tears as she sat down beside Jim, and folded him to her ample, mo- therly bosom'. 

 Gerrard presently drew her aside, and put two five-pound notes in her hand. 

 "Indeed I won't, sir. I like the lad too much 1 No, sir, not even as a pre- sent. But I do hope you won't mind his writing to us sometimes. And will you mind my saying, Mr. Gerrard, that me and my husband are very sorry to hear that your station has been burned, and that you have lost nearly &\\l your cat- tle. And we have taken a liberty which I hope won't offend you-it is only a present for Jim, and won't give you any trouble on board the steamer/and the freight is paid right on to St �uerset, my husbands put five hundred-weight ot best Sydney lucerne hay on boarid. so you won't have no trouble in feeding him j and. although I say it myself, 

 there's not a better bred bull-calf in North Queensland." . 

 "Do you mean to say, Mrs. Woodfall, that you have given Jim that Young Duke bull of yours P Why, ho's worth fifty pounds ! Oh, no, I can't alloAV you to be so generous as that." 

 "You can't help it now. Mr. Ger- 

 rard," said the pod woman trium-, pliantly; "my husoand brought him on board last night, and he is now in his stall on the foredeck as hanny as a king, and I hope he will prove his good blood when you once have him at Ocho Bios. Come and look at him," �nd ehe smiled with pride as she led the way out of the saloon. 

 Tho animal was comfortably estab- lished in a stall on tho foredeck, and beside him was Woodfall feeding him with the "Sydney lucerne." 

 "Woodfall, that bull is going ashore right away unless you take fifty pounds for. him," said Gerrard; "he'll be worth five .hundred pounds to me." 

 "Can't take it. Mr. Gerrard. He's a presentado Jim, so it's no use talking. But I would take, it as a favour if you'd send me a -line and tell me how he bears the journey." 

 "Indeed, I will, Woodfall," replied Gerrard, who was greatly touched by this practical demonstration .of their re- gard for him ; for he knew that their excuse of giving the bull to Jim WAS a filiallovv one, and that both husband and wife were aware that the animal would prove of the Greatest value to him, now that Ocho "Rios was practically without .cattle. And such sympathy went to his .heart. ' "The world �B full 

 ol kind people,' ' h� thought. Then he1 

 tu rued to Mrs. Woodfall and her hus baud with a �mile. "Come back to the saloon "with me. The steamer will leave in half an hour, and we shall not have much time to talk together. And the steward is giving us tea there." 

 The big woman's face flushed with pleasure. 

 "That is kind of you, Mr. Gerrard. I can drink a cup of tea, but would bo afraid to ask that swell steward for it, he hooks like-" , 

 "Like a duko in disguise, eh? But he'll take a shilling tip from anyone, I can assure you." 

 "Well, I never! He ought to bo ashamed of himself. English fashions are a-conving in, aren'$ they. Mr. Ger- rard? Just fancy �ny respectable man taking a shilling for doing the work he is paid for ! Fifteen pound a month, j these steamer stewards get, so Mr. Lacey tells me. My ! But he won't get uo shilling from me." 

 "Indeed, he shall not, Mrs. Woodfall. You are my guest. �$o'v, come along, please, as Miss Fraser and the rest will be waiting for us." 

 "Mr, Gerrard, isn't Miss Fraser a bonny girl-and can't she ride! I don't want to lie rude, sir, but you will have to have a mistress for Ocho Rios; and she is one of the sweetest girls in, the country, and right to your hand, so to speak." 

 "Mrs. Woodfall, you are surprising me. First you give Jim a bull calf worth fifty to sixty pounds, and then you try to fill ray head with the idea that a young lady whom I have only" known for a few .weeks--" 

 "Ah, Mr. Gerrard I Trust a woman for knowing things that men don't see. I saw her looking at you in the saloon -and, well, I know a thing or two." 

 "I am sure you do," said Gerrard laughingly, as they re-entered the saloon, "but I should have to get another face before I ask anyone to marry me." 

 "Not at all. Why, Mr. Gerrard, in "a year or two all those red scars ~Vill have gone, and you will be the same nice nutty brown all over.1'' 

 "How are you. Gerrard?" said a little white-haired man in uniform. "I am glad to see you on board the Gam- bia once more. You'll share my cabin, 

 of course?" 

 "Thanks, Captain Mc Alister, I shall be delighted," and then the master of the steamer, after an admiring glance at Kate, and a look of wondering sym �tatby at the left side of Gerrard's ace, hurried oh deck to the bridge. 

 "Two big bottles of Pomntery, stew- ard; never mind the tea. . Quick, please," cried Lacey to the steward; "the skipper has just gone on the bridge, and we'll just hare time for a doch and dorrish. Miss Fraser." The steward soon had the bottles opened. 

 ' "Gerrard, me boy, I wish you lash- ings of luck, and you, too. Miss Fraser. Jim, my son, don't forget to write. Come, Mrs. Woodfall ; you really must, or I'll not speak to ye for a month. Here's to the bright �yes of the ladies t Miss Fraser, don't be after playing with any more alligators-they're nasty 

 things tor alligators to handle. Now J* I must be going; there's the last bell," and shaking hands all round once more, the genial Irishman left the saloon with the Woodfalls to go on shore, learing Gerrard and his party to make their way on deck. 

 The engines throbbed, and the great hull of tho steamer 6lid slowly along the pier, and Gerrard and his friends went to the rail to seo the last of 

 Lacey. He, however, for the moment-*", did not see them, as he was hurriedly writing in his pocket-book. Then tearing out the leaf, he looked up, and pushing his way through the crowd to the edge of the pier, was just in time to reach out and plaoe the paper - in Gerrards hand. 

 "Don't read it now," ho cried, as ho drew back; "put it in your pocket. 

 Good-bye and good luck." ^ 

 A few minutes: later Captain McAlis ter asked Gerrard and Fraser3 ,to como 

 up on the bridge, and Gerrard unfold- ed Lacey's missive and read: 

 "Just recognised one of your fel- low passengers-tall, stout, good looking, yellow moustache, jewellery. Loot out for him-noted card-sharper and all-round blackguard. Calls him- self Honble Wllburd Merriton, but has heaps of aliases-ex-gaol bird." "Gerrard showed the note to Fraser, who nodded, and said he had noticed the man. 

 "I think there is a party of them. See, there they, are together at the companion, and, by Jove, I can swear to one of them I I tried him at Ara- luen for being-concerned in gold-steal- ing and gave him three years "hard.' That is he with the black moustache and Jewish .features-Mr. Barney 

 Green."
