 LALL BIGHTS EESEETED.]-: -CHAPTER XXI.� CCk)imNinsa-0 

 The property of John Fane, 'known as BongiBong; extended 'dver 3000* by lOGGa; and was very productive, repaying him ^ell '? for tke trouble he had taken with.it. ' The House,' as his shanty was calJed � for there were one or two other dwellings on his estate � was a rough wooden structure, con sisting of three rooms, plain and homely furnished, nevertheless serviceable and re markably clean ; and there 'were several pictures on the walls that formed rather a motley . collection, ?which had .belonged to 

 the late owner. At the far end or the domain was a hut occupied by John Fane's , overseer, Tom Tyler, a tall, hard-faced, dried up looking man. He was a native of Aus f tralia, who had lived in those parts 20 years or more, and he was considered the best bnflhman in fl^ the surrounding country. ? There was not much of a garden on the estate, and vegetables of different kinds grew in what little there was, The stables consisted of a tumble-down shed, which, though terribly patched, protected the horses from the cold winds, but there were new stables in the jcourse of erection. As John Fane rode up to Bong-Bong he was met by Tom Tyler, who came forward, his face beaming with pleasure. � Well, Tom, how go things here?' asked John Fane. ' All right, sir ; but I am downright glad to see you back. I was afraid you'd been hurt with them fires.' '*' We have had a rough time of it any how. I lost 50 splendid bullocks, half of which were for Mount Dean^ Any news from there?' - 'Yes, sir. Mr. Bean 'himself rode over yesterday to see if you'd come back. I don't fihinTr he's got wind of the fire yet.' 'How so?' ? � He never said anything to me about fires. And the papers i^ejy,er,.had a, w,ord; about it in them, except 7 Saturday's, and that only said ..something about a fire Jbaving broken but' lathe 'south;' ? - r�-. - ,- - ; 'Where did you get the news from?' ' Omeo 5 he's only just returned from Baijhurst yesterday, where he met some of - them poor devils who had suffered by it. He was full of it.' ' Did you say anything to Mr. Dean about it?' \\ . 

 ..� .�o, sir. ja.e was in sucn a ? ? jrarry -- that there was no time to say much to him, but he left a message for you to go over as soon as you coujd^to- him.' : ,...'.,', 'I'll go as soon as I am a bit rested. Any fresh news down here ?' ''''. ?'' '.'There was a stir round here last Monday and Malcolm's overseer is not expected to Jive.' 'How's that?' 'He was stuck up inlithgow Valley by six boys, was taken off V�i� horse, stripped, tied to a tree, and he says they gave him three dozen lashes. The poor ?wretch was found by Omeo crawling home, as best he could, naked.' ' What did Omeo do with him ?' ' Brought him here, and Jack and myself took him over to Malcolm's.' 'Is he very bad?' 'I believe he is, sir- Doctor says hej3 caught some chitis or the other, I forget the jiame.' ' Bronchitis? ' ''^That's it, sir.' 'Send Omeo to me Tom, I want him to take Prince and give him a rub down, then catch Betty and saddle her.' ...' .Very well,' said Tom, moving off , but he was arrested by John Fane saying � ?'By the way, Tom, have you had any trouble with the bushrangers since T have been gone?' .' Well, sir, there were two shjaggy, red haired- coves turned up here the ;day before yesterday, asking for a little tea and sugar,: ^rhiph I |hought best to give i�em.-_ But; mjag do you ask, sir? AnySiing gone' ?wtfdngT ? . ' . ' :,??' v ??..'?.?-.:. ' No, Tom, no ; only I happened to fall in with, some rum-looking customers*- who stole my blanket, tobacco, and pipe, They seemed to know you right enough. ; but never mind now, as I must get away as soon as I can.' Haviog plentifully refreshed himself, John Fane mounted Betty, his beautiful dark bay mare, and rode off in the compara tive coolness of the .dying day. CHAPTER XXH. Awaking Lore, , 'Good morning, Agnes. You look as if you had seen a ghost. 'Why,, what 1b the matter,' child ?' said Richard Dean- entering his daughter's sitting-room, two weel$s after the first outbreak of the bush fires in the south. . k . ~ .... It was a hot, sultry, heavy morning j the windows that lecCrpp: tp'^�%-ye^iaSiah were opened, and #^?~iush,-tats^. wlyeji .were soaked with water, were pulled down so as to make it if possible a little cooler. By the window stood Agnes Dean, wearing a cling ing gown of the palest blue. She was so engrossed in the columns . of the. morning paper that she had not heard- her father enter the room, and when he spoke she. was startled. ** Good morning, father,' she ^sai�|., kissing him. ' Just listen. I wonder whether John is all right' � she had long since dropped the name of Mr. Fane, and learned to call 

 him, as in former . days, by that of John � ' there has been a terrible bush fire in the south, and you know he went down to Mount Hesse. Oh ! I do hope nothing has : . happened to him.' ' A bush fire, did you say, child ? Where abouts?' .' All south by Cape Otway, and in that district principally, father.' ' What is the date of the paper ?' '.'February 19, 1851, and to-day is the 2Qth- It says the. fire iroke out -on the: ?6th, and there is ho news from- him. - 1 hope ? all is right.' . ' ! :,V'. I only trust he will not be too foolhardy, ; but he is a brave lad, and will take care of ? himself. I would be sorry if anything were ; to happen to him. Bead what the paper says, Agnes, and then I shall be able to - judge , better the mischief done.' ' ' Abridged,' ' reads Agnes, going close up ; to the window. ' ' Abridged from the Mel- ; bourne Argus. The late bush fires. In ; Saturday's issue we briefly alluded to the extensive bush fire that prevailed through out the country, more particularly on Thurs- '; day preceding. Rumors had reached us of conflagrations on every side, but as we did not wish to appear alarmists we refrained from noticing any but those that were well authenticated, knowing how exceeding prone report is to magnify and distort particulars. Since then, however, we learned with regret that very little only of the ill known had reached us, and that 'what we thought mag nified is unhappily very far from the fearful extent of the truth. In the neighborhood of the Western Port it is reported that the only house left standing is the inn at Dandarong-. The destruction in this quarter is most distressing, since -very many hard working and persevering settlers have been - brought to the verge of ruin.' ' 'Good God!' exclaimed Mr. Dean. 'Any news of the Careys' place ?' , ' I cannot see anything, father. At Mr. Hopper's'. place on the Waurn Ponds, houses, implements, barns, and stock were all de- j stroyed, and three lives lost. It is reported ' that the Eelperonds is partially destroyed, j Mr. Costigan's farm on the Corio side of the ? Narrabool is still burning. The Boninyong j Forest is in a blaze, and the timber country ! is suffering severely. ' When did Tom Tyler say John was ex pected back, father ?' continued Agnes, ad dressing. .Mr.. Dean. . ? 'He ought to have been back two or 'three days ago. Give me the paper, child.' ' May be the Careys -will send us news, j father ; and perhaps John has not started j from their place yet.' ' Til go and send David over to Bong Bong, to see if he has come in yet. I trust nothing has happened to the lad,' said Mr. Dean,, throwing . the paper on the table and ! going off in the direction of David's cottage. The day wore on in restless anxiety to the Deansj waiting the return oi the messenger from John Fane's place. In ;spite of Agnes Dean's outward cheerfulness she carried a heavy heart. She had learned to love John Fane within the last year. True, no word of love, no promise, no seeking of favor on one side, no half denial, half granting of precious gifts, had passed between them. In one sense the world would have held him harmless, while friends and companions of her own sex would most certainly hint at mistaken- feelings, delusive hopes, on her .part. Yet there was surely some unwritten bond, some ?fixed and changeless contract, slowly but 'imperceptibly traced in cha racters faint and pale, then clearer, fuller, deepening daily to indelible imprint, on her heart: Were the friendly counsels, the deep unaffected interest, the. frank brotherly inter course, all to pass for. Nothing, to be trans lated into the careless courtesy affected by every formal ?visitor? It may not have been apparent to those around Agnes Dean ; she was still the same, always so unfailingly attentive in her role of .mistress of Mount Dean, yet :with a beating heart and aching head, which rendered the severest mental effort necessaiy to :av*�id:; collapse, she per formed her daily duties. She had receired many.'atteniipnB from' itjjate bachelors in the surrounding country j -and they had' failed to make aaayfianpijessioaas on her. But when John Fane appeared it -was' different. She had at first ...pitied him, but after a while that pity had melteiTto a deep unchangeable love, that a woman: gives only once in her lifetime. While he on his part had fallen in love ?with thev playmate of his childhood days ; but the past forbade his speaking' � to the world he was a convict, a prisoner on ticket-of-leaye. Agnes's thoughts that day would wander to John � of the possibility that he had fallen a ?victim to the fire, and perhaps she should see \\nm no more. She had pitied those hopeless uncomplaining women, maimed in the battle of life, hiding their mortal wound from human gaze, bear ing up ..with trembling, steps the . burden of premature age and sorrow. Would h'er' fate be one of these? ? The long hot day came to an end, and as evening broke it became a little cooler, and a slight -breeze had sprang up. Richard Dean, had gone out to see David Waller and give some' necessary orders concerning' the business of the next morning. The western sky was streaked with deep gold and red, flecked here and there with blue and .white, upon which the gold reflected. The quiet' hush of ihje Australian*' summer's ^evening reigned, only broken by the noisy cicadas that sung a|oft -in the tree- tops, their noise resemblimg that of many small pebbles in; a tin can rattled together, like a child's plaything. vOn the. verandah sat Agnes, herhands toying listlessly with a iew loses, which Jackey, the till-round, man, had brought her. By her Bide lay an open book, at her feet 

 a black ', and white collie dog. She was Looking ^ill. Perhaps it was the extreme heat of the day, or possibly the anxiety of the morning. She was restless, very rest less, a thing unusual 'with her. At the gate stood the figure of a man, watching her with much intentness. She did not perceive Tym or hear the sound of his footsteps on the ground. Perchance the noisy cicadas deadened the sound, John Fane � for it. was he � stood gazing .at her intently, as if his eyes had never rested on go fair a vision before. The delicately moulded chin and throat, the bright hair clustering around the low white forehead rested above it like a crown. The face, the figure of the girl stood out clearly against the dark background. What a pretty pic ture it made ! Surely this was love,, which made him thus stand, drinking in the fair scene around Vn-m and watching the form of the unconscious girl. Was this the same man who had sworn only a few years ago his hatred for every woman ? ' Bah ! they are all fair, and as false as they are fair � yet why condemn all for one ?' He could not venture to re-open the question that was burning in his brain. What must be, must be. Only the creed of the fatalist could bring any comfort now. He durst not hope, and was afraid to fear. But what right had he to love? He whose name was blotted with the crime of murder, and, far worse, the murder of a wife. God help him in his new and waking love ! Then swift as lightning through his brain ran the thoughts � Does she love me ? or does she only pity me ? There are many like John Fane in this world who during life are under the influ ence of strong passions and are happy, but if they were cured of them would be mise rable. Those -who would eradicate all these hopes 'and fears out of the human breast as the.meaiis of happiness are but ill-acquainted with the economy of the. mind. The in action and apathy that are the necessary attendants on such, a state of passions would be greater evils than the most unbounded licence such a man possesses. As John Fane thus stood watching Agnes she moved restlessly in the chair, then half rose. This movemenjb on the part of the girl caused the dog to look up, and seeing John Fane at the gate he made a leap for ward with a -joyful bark and rushed towards the gate. ' Lie down, Chappie, lie down. Is that you, father?' she asked, in a low troubled tone ; but no answer came. Evening was slowly throwing her soft mantle over mother earth; therefore she could not distinguish the figure that was slowly approaching^up the pathway. ' Good evening, Agnes,' said the well known voice of John Fane at her side. ' Oh ! John, how you startled me. How glad I am to see you ; and father too, will not he be delighted,' she said, jumping up and extending both her hands. ' We have been so fearfully anxious about you,' she added, lowering her voice and letting her hands rest in his. ' I am so pleased you have come back.' 'Are you really?' he replied, holding tight the hands placed within his own. ' Sit down, John, while I run and find father, he cannot be far off.' ' Never mind your father, Agnes. Come and sit down.' It seems such a long time since I saw you hast.' He still retained possession of her hands, and drew her to wards the chair she, had just vacated. Some thing in his look and voice startled her. He stooped and picked Up the roses which lay at her feet, and handled them, gently, look ing upon them as if they .were something very pre/aous. She had never seen that strange ^expression x-n his face before. It was notfthe look she had expected� ^had half dreaded to see, that she could have interpreted, -but it was a look: quite new to her, a look which she could not explain. (to be continued.)
