THE MISFORTUNE!} OF BEILBY 

 BOOLGER. 

 BY 

 CHAPTER IX. 

 THEKE were fresh tracks of natives, who had been fishing in a largo sheet of water not far from the camp, and Leysid thought he would look to the watches in person during the night. A few nights previously having found Arthurs asleep in a patch of long grass with his rifle for a pillow he had forthwith given him a " caution" in the form of a good kick. On this night ho heard Boolgor, whose watch had ended, calling Arthurs to turn out, and supposing that Arthurs had so done Leysid fell asleep again. Immediately opposite the camp on tho other side of the river was an island covered with low trees. Leysid awoke about 11 o'clock, and went out to seo how the night looked, and whether the sentries were on guard. Tho camp fire was burning brightly, but no watchman was to bo seen on that side. He then walked round tho camp, and stood listening for the clink of,tho,horse hobbies it had been thought advisable to remove the bells. He lit his pipe and sat down on a log. Suddenly he hoard voices, from the bed of the river. " Oh, tho lads have been round the horses," thought ho, and paid little attention, only wondering that the voices did not come closer. Again he hoard the voices. There was no mistaking from whom the sounds came-darkies, and a number of thom. The night was still, and ho could hear several voices distinctly. Ho was on the point of arousing his mon. It occurred to him that the niggers could not bo awaro of the presence of his party, as they were talking so unrestaiuc'dly ; if they meant mischief, a shower of spears would havo probably been the first intimation of their proximity. While hesitating whether ho should call the men or not, ho bethought him of the unfaithful sentry, and was moving to question the other man as to when he had last seen Arthurs, when, as if by magia, up sprung cloven fires on the island in front of his position. He moved on cautiously, and stumbled over Arthurs, quito twenty yards from the camp, fnst asleep in his former position. Lcysid's first impulse was to kick him into life, Mt ho thought a fright would have moro effect, so, raising bira by the collar of his coat, he shook him as a mastiff would a poodle. When tho lad Mas thoroughly awakened ho led him towards the river bank, and, pointing across, said, " What is that?" 

 Arthurs jumped off the ground-the sight had roused him fully-" Why it's niggers !" ho 

 exclaimed. 

 "Yes," said Leysid, "and you may thank God tho river is between us and them, or you might not bo quite so lively ; moro likely lying toes up with a spenr through your heart. And what of us whose lives are depending on your watch- fulness? I have cautioned you once about this. If I ever find you nsleop on your watch again it will be you and I for it. So tako heed." 

 Arthurs looked at the sturdy figure before bim, and was silent. Doubtless the sable troop had seen the fire, but concluded it to be a stump burning, as may be seen for weeks after a bush fire. Loysid and Arthurs stood listening. They coidd distinguish the voices of women and children, so were satisfied. The party were on a fishing expedition. When mischief is meant the encumbrances are left at home, or at a safe distance from the scene of tho intended strife. 

 Arthurs, in reply to some question of Lcysid's, raised his voice rather incautiously, nnd the fires disappeared instaiitlyT No more was heard of the blacks during tho night ; but Arthurs managed ever after to keep his eyes 

 open. 

 When day broke all the horses were missing -they had smelt the blacks and hastened to leave their neighbourhood, instinctively know- ing there was enmity botween thom, though the blacks had not as yet acquired a taste for horseflesh, aa their brethren on the Palmer did in later days. The missing beasts wero found about five miles back on tho track by which they had como. 

 Whon all was ready for starting, Loysid rode over to the island. Scolcs and ho followed the tracks-which wero those of a largo party-up the river bed, to the Brocken mountains. The country on that side not presenting a very inviting appearance, he followed tho west bank down about four milos to a conical hilh underneath which there was a plain of con- siderable extent having some waterholes on it, whero Leysid determined to encamp for a time, and explore a distance ahead. Lambing time was not far distant, and, if ho could find nothing better, where he was would answer. Leaving Scolcs and Tom Burns with tho stock, ho took Arthurs, Boolgcr, and a man named Kelly with him. Their first stage was to the twdnty mile crossing, a considerable timo being occupied in searching tho country caoh side. The tracks of alligators-I bog pardon of my honourable friend ; well, crocodiles-but not the reptiles themselves wore seen. The night passed in quiet. In the morning a horse named Lot was missing. Ho was one of the leant troublesome, and had boon selected on that account. Somo time was spent in searching for nim. ' Tho other horses had fed away from tho r, er, BI� no one thought of looking there. Arthurs and Kelly wero seeking Lot; Leysid and Boolgor woro at tho camp. " Tho old horso might havo gone down for a drink," said tho latter. "I will go and see." Ho went on foot, and found old Lot up to the shoulders in a quicksand-a not uncommon thing to meet with in sandy ,bcds of rivors after a fresh. Tho old follow had been struggling to extricate himself, but had only succeeded in churning the sand Into spume. Boolgor ran to the camp for a rope. When LeyBld and ho returned great was their nstpnishment to see poor Lot attacked by an alligator. Tho saurian had clawed a piece tho sizo of a dinnor plato from his right haunch. Lot, mad with pain and fright, made a trcmon dous plungo and found footing for his fore feet, and with their assistance ho reached firm ground, Loysid and Boolgor mcanwhilo Bhout ing with all their might. Tho great lizard sur- veyed thom calraly.aa if wondering what strango creatures those woro, thon scuttled away for tho water at a fast pace Lot went straight to tho camp, whero ho stood bleeding badly, Thoro wero no means at hand of staunching it, but Loysid sowed the skin together with a palm and ncodlo, put a lump of alluvial ^uud > kneadod into pasto on it, and though tho wound liad no 

 other dressing, save to renew the mud as it caked off, it healed perfectly. Old Lot > worked for many years after. Loysid was glad he hod not brought his favourite dogs with him, the alli- gators, or crocodiles, being very partial to the canine race, probably owing to the ease with which they could devour them at a gulp. When Kelly and Arthurs roturncd, and heard of Lot's escape, they were most anxious to interview the reptile, never having seen one of the tribe. Being assured that they would have frequent opportunities of making their acquaintance they were pacified. 

 That day the party carno to Pelican Crock. Leysid had heard of sonic likely conntry in that vicinity, and he resolved to stay for somo days to look round. Leysid generally took Kelly with him, leaving Arthurs to sec to the horses, and Boolgcr as camp-keeper, who kept them well supplied with duck and other wild fowl until tho men loathed t(ic sight of a feather so nice do wo become in the midst of plenty Boolgcr exooptedj-vvho-had not forgotten the old hones in theschooner's hold. They had been C�""nt* thw'ofornwook,' vv hen one morning Lcy sid's own riding horse was ni is".'""" -�telly went to seek for him, and found tho horse's trail going into the river bed, whero ho lost it. As the general direction had been up the river, Kelly follovycd on for ohout twelve miles. The sun was liot, and, as both ho and the mare wore thirsty, ho resolved to have a drink, and perhaps a swim. Ho know of an immense waterhole riot far away, and into it he rode under the shade of a largo ti-tree. Ho rodo tho mare in t'o tho girths and allowed her to drink at her pleasure. The water was beauti- fully clear and ,'cool looking, and ho thought what a glorious swim he would havo presently, to be sure. First, however, he would have a smoko ; he lit his pipe. The mare, approving of the eoohicss of her position, shovvod no in- clination to move. Kelly grew contemplative ; his thoughts travelled to his home and the gal he adored ; he forgot' all about his intended bath. A refreshing breeze carne down tho sheet of water. Kelly sat gazing routid him in a dreamy ecstasy, from which a snort from tho marc aroused him. Kelly looked down, think- ing that the lcechos vvero making free with the mare's legs. Great Jerusalem ! what was that fearful thing not a foot, as it seemed to him, from tho mare's noso ? In all, his dreams nothing so hideous had presented itself : nu ugly head, a pair of cruel-looking steely eyes, Tho saurian opened his jaws, displaying an airay of immense teeth and a cavernous mouth, whereon Kelly avvokofrom his stupor of amaze- ment, wheeled tho maro to the bank, and drove the spurs into her sides ; but the mare seemed to be fascinated by tho monster. It needed sundry applications of the steel and lashes of the stock� hip to get her started. Ho had not the faintest inkling of a desire for closer inspec- tion ; he never drew bridle until the camp wns reached. As soon as he carne in sight he shouted, "Alligator 1 alligator!" under the full belief that ho was being chased. When the others heard the tramp of a horse at speed, one idea possessed them-some ono chased by niggers; and they How to arras. What ho waa shouting could not bo hoard distinctly. The mure, punting, exhausted, covered with foam, stopped at the tent, and Kelly almost fell olf, and i oiled on tho ground, groaning as if in mortal pain. Seeing who the rider was-it was impossible to tell tho colour of the horse-the pin ty bccaino a little assured, but, still under the impression that blacks were coming, in- quired of Kelly how far olf thoy weie, how many of thom, and ho on. No reply could they get from Kelly-only moans and cries of "Oh ! the brute, Oh ! the beast ; I'm frightened to death." 

 "Dieuch him with a bucket of water, Boolgcr," said Leysid. "Perhaps we shall then get a coherent answer from him." L 

 Under that treatment, in which Al thura assisted with a second bucket, Kelly recovered. 

 " Now what is the matter?" inquired Arthurs. " How caiuo you to ride the maro to death in this way?" 

 " I saw an alligator," he replied. 

 " So did Will and I, and Lot too to his cost. What of that ? Whore did yon see him ?" 

 "In the liver." 

 " In the creek, do you mean ?" ".No, in the river." 

 " Why, wo aro ten miles from the river. Whereabouts in the liver?" 

 " In the big waterhole at Flogstono Creek." 

 " What !" roared Leysid in undisguised 

 astonishment. 

 "Oh ! oh ! I never saw such a baste. I come near falling into his ugly mouth." 

 " Why, that place is twelve good miles from this. Do you mean to say that you rode at a gallop here because you saw an alligator? Nearly killed poor Bessy too. Hovvover, I do not think you will do it or a like trick in a hurry again. I will caution you at till events," 

 Whereupon ho administered such a thrashing with a stirrup-leather to Kelly that he rolled on the ground bellowing for mercy. 

 " Got up, you brute, and sponge the maro. Put your own blankets on her. AH the nights aro cold you will no doubt repent yot�r hasty action ero morning." 

 Boolgcr hod boen shooting [ducks down tho creek, and when the alarm was given ho hurried up expecting to hear that the camp was about to bo attacked. Leysid wa? at work administer- ing his caution. When Will heard tho true state of tho caso he was just as angry as Leysid at the state tho maro was in, Bessy being a great favourite. But they could not resist the fright- ened look of Kelly, who as ho recovered his equanimity seemed disposed to amplify on the horrid appearance of the brute, stating that the "hallygater" hod chased him for somo distanco ; that he could run almost as fast as the mare ; could roar like a bull, &c. To all which the others turnod a deaf car. 

 "Whero is Sancho?" said Loysid. "I never Baw him, sir, at all." 

 "Sancho joined the other homos nbout an hour ago," said Will, "at the water." 

 Loysid turned away in disgust, but Arthurs and Boolgcr tormented Kelly until ho wished ho had never hoard tho name of an alligator. 

 They roturncd next day to tho main camp. All hands sot to work making yards and pro 

 paring for lambing, and for tho shearing which 

 would follow in a couple of months. For somo weeks they wore so busy as not to havo much time for riding about. Tlio prononce of abori- ginals in their neighbourhood was never sus- pected. The main camp where Loysid, Boolgor, and Burns, with the drivers of the teams, lived was back from the river somo 300 yards, on a knoll. Near to tho river b mk was a sheepyard, in whioh the fat sheep for consumption vvero folded. Arthurs was sont down tho river some oight miles with tho dry sheep, and tho most reliable shepherds with him. Thoro was a hut for the shophords to sloop in. 

 Loysid's preparations wero hardly completed whon the rain descended in such torrents as aro only experienced in tho tropics. In tho muidlo of tho wot tho owes commenced to lamb. Tlio river was at its height, tho adjoining country being tho only sound ground-all olso was ono bog. 

 After the rain ceased and tho rivor fell to its normal lovel, sheep wore reported missing in twos and throes from tho flock at tho river, The shophord vovyed that they vvero taken out of the yard,, instancing one peculiarly marked �hoop which ho saw ontor tho yard on tho previous 

 night. No noise had been hoard; tho dogs gavo no warning. 

 Old Paddy Oran, the shepherd, said, "I'm thinking 'tis the naygurs, bad coss to 'em. Mc fine black-faced weddor is gone. 'Tis lonely I'll be widout.'im. He'd ate bread out �v mc hand like a Christian, so he wud. Andmoic betoken, tho sheep that's gone were the fa Mont 

 of the flock." 

 " I will watch myself," said Scolcs to Loysid. " Say nothing to tlio other men." 

 Ho constructed a small hut o� houghs on the side next the river, whence he could seo the ) ard. The first night of his watch no sheep wove taken. On the second night, which was starlit and clear, hearing a stir among tho sheep, Scolcs crept cautiously round under shelter of the fence, rifle in hand. Two dark forms were crouched alongside the fence; ho Mas curious to know in what manner thoy effected their purpose without disturbing the flock. Whilo watching tho movements of thoso two he noticed that the sheep on tho farther side of the yard wero rising one or tM-o at a time, and crossing to where tho blacks were, as sheep M ill do M hen something disturbs without frightening them �"C.'1 a3 n rft'' or �thcr vermin in tho timber of which tho yan? '."I" composed. Close and closer the sheep pressed, turning U.H� looking to tho sitio they had loft. Suddenly doM'n went a sheep without a struggle. Now, how were thoy going to get the body out of tho yard without rising and so alarming tho flock ? One of them inserted a stick, crooked at the end, between tho poles of the yard. It just roached the dead sheep. After a fow ineffectual attempts tho crook caught on the sheep's logs, and by the united efforts of tho twQ'tho body was drawn closo to the fonce. Tho third black, who had been as it woro driving the shcop, noiv caine round, gliding along the ground snako wisc. Three arms wero thrown over the fence, the dead shcop was raised on to tho fence, from that on to the shoulders of one, who unido straight for the river bed, whoro some dark objectsM'crojustdiscerniblc. Scolos allowed him to reach the vivor bank, then ho fired, and down went the black and his load. Tho dark forms disappeared up the opposite bank, and Leysid and Will carno running down at the report. The sheep lay there, but no black. 

 "Whathave you got', Ned?" said Leysid. 

 "I have npt what I ought to have," replied ho. 1 "Hero's the sheep, but no darkie. I sighted him right enough, not soventy yards away. The piece is good at 200. It's tho light 

 I suppose." i 

 " Never minti," said Leysid, " I um just as Mell pleased that the poor M retch escaped. This may be a caution to 'thom to let our mutton 

 alone." 

 "Caution!" growled Ned. "I'll make it a caution to the thieving black \\ermin the noxt time I drop on to thom." 

 " N.iy, Ned, do not be bloodthirsty," said Loysid.
