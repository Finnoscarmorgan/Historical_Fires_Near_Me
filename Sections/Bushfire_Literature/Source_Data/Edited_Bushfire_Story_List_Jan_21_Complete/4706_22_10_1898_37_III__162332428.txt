 THE CAMP AT WANDlNONp. 

 [BY ETHEL TURNER.] 

 CHAPTER III. 

 , Tliere was a curious difference arid dis 

 tinction observable in the play , of Dorrie and Bert, that was due to imagination and the want of it. 

 ? Dorrie was eminently practical. 

 Her favourite game took colour from the life around them. There was always a gold mine in it; when she picked tip sticks and tree branches they instantly became 

 Fickaxes or shovels. When she was not 

 eterson she was one of the miners- of 

 Coolgardie fame. She invariably smoked as she digged-at all events, she kept a twisted piece of wood in her lips that she called lier pipe. Sometimes she muttered words, under her breath that made* Bert's hair,stand on end. She never unearthed a nugget less vaJue than �20,000. 

 Bert was happiest galloping on a great stick through the blind, bush tangle beyond the ci�ek; plunging into prickly shrubs to rescue maidens who were under spells of enchantment; flying along through rocky defiles and mountain passes, a bushranger with a price on his head; sticking a white cock's featliisr in his old sailor hat and lead ing a "tousand" knights in a. wild rush upon the army of the League. 

 Sometimes he induced Dorrie to play too. Five days he would dig obediently and help her lift a great boulder of stone, and shout ami joy exceedingly with her when they decided it was the best find since the rush in '72, and worth �100,000 if a penny. But the sixth lie would mutiny, and insist she should he a "merry man" or an enchanted princess, or Virginia walking innocently along, unaware that the bit of stick up his sleeve was a whittle soon to be plunged in her side. 

 ; And if she refused, he would still follow her, .and hang about while she excavated and brought treasures to light, but his mouth would be smileless, and when* re quested to join in admiration when the ' Welcome 'Nugget'.' was unearthed, would say with unfeeling coldness 

 "Pooh, it's nofring but a piece of ole 

 brown stone." 

 On these occasions Dorrie generally gave in 4o the inevitable, and became a Prin cess under protest; no one could keep on turning up marvellous treasures with dam pers like that. But she dragged gold into the games with her. 

 If she was a Princess under the spell of a wizard, she insisted upon living in a castle where the dungeons were filled with bags and bags of gold and diamonds and rubies, that the rescuing priuce would get when he broke the spell. 

 Tt she was a bushranger, she always had a cave where, in a liole underground, were stolen treasures enough to buy up a city. 

 If she was a knight, pressing where she saw a "white plume sliine amidst the ranks of war," she always insisted upon sacking a city after victory, and going back laden witli spoils. 

 Peterson worshipped the children'. He had been at Wandinong two years instead of three months, which is all the time he would have given the wretched place if it had not been for the sunshine they gave 

 I him. 

 Years ago on that far west station he had worshipped the "eheeifu1 young lady at �20 a year." Never told her so, of course; he was merely a drover, and had no vision of her for weeks and months at a time. But when he rode beside his slowly string ing ? stock towards the burning sunsets, and thought idly of the fire he would make 

 in another mile or two, and the billy lie would boil, and the shade in which he would lie, then he used also to think of her laugh and her little blowing curls, and lier thin, small hands. 

 One time when he had been travelling with sheep for grass he was away four months. He went up to the homestead on his return to beg the papers for the news of the world, and to let his eyes see Mary. 

 The children told him the news-Miss Martin was married, and had gone away what a pity he had not been there to see the silver teapot they had given her. 

 In four years the memory naturally had become merely a gentle, faded one. 

 He went still further "out West;" he helped to battle with the eternal droughts that reigned there; he sheared his 100 sheep a day; he worked on a station where race horses were bred, and caught a passing racing fever that swept away the pile shear ing had accumulated. 

 Then he sickened of stock and saddle and rims, sickened of the sight of a roping pole or branding iron-boire with them for another year, for his nature was a curi ously slow one, then he drifted out of it, and became a man with a swag, journeying nowhere, telling one bush story over a ! camp fire in the "land of lots o' time rflong 

 the Castlereagh," and a companion one in the bar of an inn on the Lachlan. 

 From chopping wood at Cowra he drifted to places where the earth gaped piteously, and tents made grey white spots in the --irnrnt bush. He bought a pick-axe him 

 self, and drifted again. Dorrie and Bert ' found him one day pegging out a little 

 claim right on their favourite playground. 

 He made friends with them; there was something in Dorrie's resolute little mouth and hands hhat warmed him to her. 

 The.v went home and told Mary of the new man who had come - a very brown man, with dull, queer eyes that looked as if tlie sun had burnt them, a rough, brown beard and very rough hair. Tim description fitted half a hundred diggers. 

 She went one day hunting for five cor ner}; and native quandongs in the bush witjh tlie children, and they came across him. lie recognised her in a moment, but the nine years of trouble and fighting and love had swept him so entirely from he? memory, he did not recall himself; merely talked of the children to her, and tlie pro spects of the place and prospects elsewhere. 

 He did not attempt to "blow hard upon the ashes'' of the little, faded memory. His "ethics were quite simplie, and it was enough that she was married. But he al lowed himself to look forward to the com ings of the children, and he let their hajids fasten arouud-his heart till they made a wonderful place of it. 

 When Mary found how quiet and re spectable lie was, and heard from Bert and Dome that they had scarcely ever heard him swear, she let them go again to their old playground, for tjhey had been very anxious to superintend his operations, and jnve advice and demonstration when they heard he was quite new at the work. 

 Dorrie took him as her especial protege. When she found he washed with an old fesliionetl cradle, and in a way of his own, she gave him no rest until -he had invested in enc of just the same shape as her ftthei s, and promised for the future to do it jut', in "this way." 

 He was almost as good to play with as lif rt. Slit used to take the little old crowbar she had pitied up, and dig and pick away or wash at the creek beside him for hours 

 at a time., and he was never too engrossed witb .hiB own fcvork to wax enthusiastic Vihen she' had a "splendid find." And li� ? never; got out. of humour, and found the 

 wonderful things she rushed to his side   merely "ole brown stones." When she ap prised apieeeof dull quartz at �300,000, wfc o^ed' to 'eye' it critically, and "be' hanged M , .I3�, surprised if it fetched'.'a 

 j ,dr .hsjf-imUiori." With Bert he was just as;-ready_ of interest and sympathy. He ?Fpvpr BiWiled at his wildest extravagances, find when bidden excitedly to "ju5; look ftt the cavalry dashing into the fickest of tt<! fi^Jit," looked instantly - more than 

 that saw. 

 .AihI such stories he could tell. The gift had surely been born with liim. There wan r o subject ort laad or sea he could not hold cue breathless upon for an hour. Stories suite ot them strong of the soil, of burning dayt anc1 fery nights on the great blank n'i.in oi the centre; of sheep creeping with wiling tongues and patient eyes for jniles nad miles and miles through sun-ravaged country. and lying down to die just before the A\\ater and green pastures were reached; ol xiesperate fights with bush fires; of the queer ways of aboriginals; of the wild joy of dnuting scrub cattle; of hunting kangaroo; (if feats of swift shearing, of branding. Strange that, soul-sickened as he was of it all, he cjuld delve back into it and fiud fascination and glory in the recount. 

 He told them once, carried away by his own eloquence, it was the only life in thp world for a man. 

 - "Then why did you "leave it?" Bert said, discontentedly. He could find no enthu siasm for the monotonous life of picking at the earth, and would have had Peter son vault into- a saddle and go back to the greenness of those other days. 

 But there came to the--man the memory of the. monotony of them-of the taste oi ashes his mouth had held. - 

 "Oh, damn'it all!" lie said, with a sudden fue,-nnd forgetful that the littlegaping ears beside him were those of Mary's children. 

 Bert looked startled. Dorrie laughed, but made a mental marginal note to the effect that her mother must not be told of the slip. 

 "Yp" are a queer man," she said. Then, confidentially, and edging away from her small brother's hearing. Do you know, I 

 was beginning to think you didn't know any 

 Swear words. ' 

 He looked at her helplessly. 

 "Do you know many?" she pursued. "Isn't it s'prising what lots there are? Do you know 'darn tny buttons,' and 'bli' me? I've just learnt those-not that they're so |-ery bad. Of course, mother doesn't trow." 

 But the dull burnt eyes looked a/t her with horror. He remembered the little nur sery governess's dainty speech and purity of plirn.se. 

 "If ever," he said, "I hear you say a word you shouldn't, I'll march you straight off to your mother and ask her to whip you. I didn't think you were such a wicked little gill." ; 

 "Why," said Dorrie, "I don't think that's much. You hear worse than that wher ever you walk. I take no notice of it." Rhe smiled, amusedly. 

 lint liis eyes glowed still more warmly. 

 "If ever," he said, "if ever I hear one of those fellows say a word he shouldn't, I'll knock his head off-or if I say a word my self." ? The thought of his own vocabulary made him suddenly nervous and humble. 

 Jt was from that date therefore he con stituted himself the keeper of the tongue of Bert and Dorrie - more especially 

 Dorrie.
