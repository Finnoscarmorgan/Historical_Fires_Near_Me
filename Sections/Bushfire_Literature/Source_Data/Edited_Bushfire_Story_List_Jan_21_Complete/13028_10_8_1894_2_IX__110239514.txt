 CHAPTER 1X (CONTUTtTED.) 

 ' Yes' Murphy replied. ' and I guess he'll allow you the dhor est road te G-isbourne, for be knowB it well; them are few of his stamp round these parts. And as straight a goer as he is handsome; at least, so I've heard tell on; this is the owner coming; and, I have always found him a right on. � may also add, yon 11 be perfectly safe with him, this trip; my wo'd, and he's a bit of a ladies1 

 man thrown in.* 

 * I hare no doubt,' the gentleman said. : * We shall travel together amicably enough. Handsome is, as handsome does, you know, Murphy.* 

 'I'ull find him all there, when wanted' ; Murphy said, 1 he'll steer c'ear of bush rangers ; my word, he knows the critturs in trutt.. an.i to his sorrow, may add.' 

 ' If he pilots us through *hi� dreadful forest,' a lady interjects, - we don't miiwl whom he may know.' 

 ' Neither shall we be taken by surprise,' another lady said. 

 Meanwhile, Curlew approached the veran dah, bowing to the ladies. He was intro 

 dnced J-y Murphy, and announced himself, ready to start with them 

 Curlew had nearly finished a little intro-' ductorv speech about himself, when Murphy arrested everyone's attention, through a sudden uncontrollable paroxysm of laughter. 

 * Why, O'Brien,' Murphy paid, 'isn't it enough to make one laugh to see old f onto there; making friends with my daughter's pet possum, when I know he'd spoil her fur, without any scruple, if we were away; and see how simple he looks all the time.' 

 The party naturally looked towards the slip raxbs, but the dog and opossum had evidently gone; neither were to be seen. 

 Murphy could only speak between inter vals of merriment, caused by Curlew speak ing with an Irish accent, io the ladies, which so surprised the landlord, he could not prevent the hilarity. 

 ' An fur sure,' Curlew said, ' Ponto knows be t fwhat he's doing. And nowleedes, may I be after assisting yes ?' 

 * Thanks Mr. O'Brien' one of the ladies answered, ' I am all right, now; my horse is verv quiet,' as Curlew placed her into the 

 saddle. 

 ' By jove,Mr. O'Brien, one could imagine you are accustomed to thi",' the gentleman said, when the other ladies were seated. 

 * Faith, maybe 1'ave' Curlew said. ' Pur have not I often lifted the purty colleen, in the ouid country? An there's Murphy, the Bvaipeen. larfin there at my clumsiness.' 

 ' You are wrong there, Pat,' Murphy said; you're not clumsy, but you are so fanny ; my word. I can t help laughing.' 

 * Arrah, now be aisy, Murphy,' Curlew said. ' Jist hitch yer hands onto this bridle, while I run inside for my whip.' 

 The party were not kept waiting long. 

 * 1 fear our horses,' a lady remarked to Curie*-,' will be rather too slow for you.' 

 ' Not all, at all' he replied. ' Faith an I fear they will not be slow enough; for sure, aint I honored by riding wid eich illegant 

 1 Oh ! Mr. O Brien' she said. ' I think 

 you must have been near die Blarney stone.' 

 * And Mr. O'Brien P another lady en quired, ' are there any Blarney stones in 

 this country ?' 

 * Bedad,' he answered,' and may be there is; sure, precious stones are everywhere. 

 The party cantered along the dusty road, occasionally meeting a bollock team, or an Ax&erii-an waggon, wending their way, to one of the digging centres. 

 At length the riders drew their horses into a slew speed, after a pleasant gallop, at a point on the road that revealed the straight \\ back of Mount Mstcedpa through the 

 foliage. 

 * I suppose Mr. O Bnen, you know these parts very well; this is a pretty view of the mountain,' the gentleman remarked. 

 ' InieedX do not' Curlew replied. ' In course I've ridden round about here, for horses, and sieh loike. That's the Macedon; and haunted by the blackfellows, of ages 

 ago.' 

 ' Haunted !' the gentleman exclaimed. 'Nonsense; now come Mr. O'Brien, I can't 

 believe that.' 

 ' Faith then' Curlew said. ' I believe it, for I've heard queer things about the old 

 mountain.* 

 ' ndeed,' the gentleman said,' pray what join �rf spirits an tiwy f* 

 ' Bed ad, and they are called' 4 Yahoos;' leastways, some name like that. But look there mister,' Curlew said, 'with a sudden 

 start. 

 'Why, they look like a patrol of mounted police,' was the reply. 11 expect these are the troopers that Murphy mentioned.' 

 ' By the powers, they are,' Curlew said. 1 Aix them if they are the bughranirers. 

 mister.' 

 A small number of troopers was plainly perceived, coming' towards them, carrying carbines ready for any alarm, moTug slowly, to properly examine the distant ranges and gullies, as they proceeded along the road. 

 The sergeant halted his nr?n, when lie met the travellers, and riding to the two ww of the party, and saluting in military style, in quired -whether they had noticed&ny honemsn {daring their journey. 

 I Curlew passed to the side of the ladies, who waited a short distance away, appearing I quite indifferent to bushrangers or police. 

 The sergeant finished his interrogations, much to the inward delight of Curlew, who felt greatly relieved when he turned hi* took to the police. 

 * I am forry they are not going in our di rection,* a lady said, 1 as we shonld bear more about the life of a bushranger.* 

 * Sure, I don't think there's much to bear,* Curlew said; ' an* little it is the troopers 

 know about them.' 

 ' But the sergeant says they will find out their hiding place,' the gentleman said. * He said they would explore the forest and the 

 mountain.' 

 ' An* indeed, did he say when ?' Curlew inquired, bekase, I must be back at my 

 sheebang, before they start.' 

 ' Yes, lie said in a few dayB, unless he re 

 ceived contrary orders.' 

 ' Acushla,' Curlew said, ' I must get back soon, afore the dirty weather breaks on us.' 

 They were now within a mile of the town ship, descending the1 long hill, and shortly afterwards stopped at the Bark T�n 

 * By yer lave, ledees,' Curlew said, as he rode up to them. ' I beg to wish each of ye's good day, and may ye's ave a pW��.T�t. 

 trip to Melbourne.' 

 * Thanks, Mr. O'Brien,' a lady said. ' And we are grateful for your kind attendance through the forest, and tope your return ride will be as pleasant as ours has been.' 

 * But stay, Mr. O Brien,' tLe jrentleman said. 'Come in and have something; you 

 are not going like this.' 

 * Jist a sup of the crathur, and that's all, yer honor. Curlew said, if ye's don't Tnir>a 

 bringing it out.' 

 ' Come in, make an exception this time ' the gentleman said, as he dismounted, ing the reins to a lady. 

 ' Sight ye's are,' Curlew said. 4 Sure, I wouldn't take a shingle off the ould house 

 springing- from his horse, and leaving the bridle hanging on his arched neck, while his large bright eyes watched his master into the 

 hotel. 

 In a few minutes, a youth appeared, com ing from the yard of the Inn, with a bucket of water, which he gave the horse Curlew rode, afterwards watering each of the others. 

 �Here's luck to you, O'Brien,' the gentle 

 man said. ' I hope we did not delay you tint 

 morning.' 

 *Not at all,' Curlew answered. 'For proud I was o be iu the company of such horsewomen, and a gentleman, the lovfees of j yerself. And may I have the felicity 0f 

 axing the ledees to have a little drap of the i 

 poteen? 

 ' Thanks,' the gentleman replied. ' � hardly think they will take anything.' 

 Curlew went outside, raising his hat and saying with the deportment of a dancinsr 

 master * 

 ' Ledees, may I bring either of the fair colleen a little beverage of the mountain dew cold as the spring oi Ca hel, and refreshing as the elix r of Gilderoy, after this warm 

 day?' 

 * You are very kind. Mr. O'Brien/ one of 

 them said. 

 * Iiave it to me to choose.* he ��?<* "An as they say in ould Ireland, Til be back in a 

 brace of shakes.' 

 He returned, earning a tray, which he handed to each lady, with an inviting glass 

 of summer beverage. 

 * Mr. O'Brion,' the lady said; 'we will each drink your health, wishing you success and prosperity.' As they, each tasted the 

 dainty draught. 

 'Arrah, now for the colleen,'he replied. ' Ye's sees I've not forgotten myself the de light of drinking health to yer purty faces 

 and may the harp of Enn always sigh softly in yer ear an* evil ne'er o'er yee's.' 

 The gentleman came out of the hotel, shook hands with Curlew, and after a short conver sation, mounted his horse; at the wan� �mo the ladies bidding him good bye. ' 

 ' An' ledees,' Curlew said, 'its myself as would like to be going on wid yees,' as the 

 party rode away. 

 The township of Gisbourzte was veiy quiet on that day, during the half hour spent by the_ travellers; no one visited the hotel, which conduced, to the jovial behaviour of Curlew, who now entered the bar, hands with Rowley, the landlord. 

 *Did you know me, old fellow.' he said. 

 ' By Jove, I did not thenRowley re plied. 'But now I do Wbat's on the 

 boards ?' 

 CHAPTER X. 

 The Qtjabbel. 

 The An str&lihti bush m t rr> n ^ sometimes oppressive during the day, when the hot sun pours its heated rays onto the forest, causing the earth to crumble. The air is void of moiRture, the leaves are droop 

 ing, and the delicate stems and 

 look nude and forsaken. The voice of nature is still, the birds have for the hour, lost the pleasure of flying from the trees, and are not even heard. The trunks of the trees along the tracks show marks of the dray wheels, through exposed roots, or large ruts. ! made when the track was soft, after severe ' rain. The bark in such cases hangs in long strips from the butt of the trees, and is cov 

 ered with heavy dust. 

 The road ran around trees that drays could pas" between, just avoiding an overhanging 

 branch, every here an i there. 

 A sound in the distance might arrest the attention of a quick ear; it is a voice pecu - liar to bush travel, only the wheel of a bul 

 lock dray rapping against the axle box, whenever the ruts on the unmade road were irregular, or deeper than usual; this sound combined with the crack of the green hide bullock whip, the echo of * he driver's voice 

 or the clink of the yoke and chains. ' ! 

 Curlew did not tarry in Giabourne ; he i heard further particulars of the movements i of the police, which were important, and j shortly after started upon his return. '� 

 Riding clear of the township, he was now ; following a track that might be supposed to 1 cany the greatest traffic; may be, the prin j cipal, if the thick layer of dust denoted the j distinction of premier. i 

 He h�ard the familiar rattle of the bullock ! team, and stopped his horse to reconnoitre. j 

 As expected, be saw a huge mass of dust 

 enveloping all around, rendering il impossi- I ble, except to the habitue of dray trwlrp to determine the style of vehicle which caused 

 such a cloud. 

 Riding near to the advancing team, he began talking to the driver, who walked by the side of the bullocks, guiding the polers by the whip, to avoid collision with protrud 

 ing trees. 

 Learning the gosrip of the roads, relating to bushrangers, he set off, and the bullock driver cracked his whip, cannoning from one bullock to another, up and down the team, while the chant of ' Gee Bally' and 4 Brindle, come 'ere who'a' gradually grew fainter,"and was soon forgotten in the impetuous speed at which the horseman, was riding. 

 However good the staying powers of a horse, such a high rate of progression <vrvn1<3 not long continue, even when the ru&d was level, and well made; but, upon a wiHiraok, whtre �h� dofit w�h lying a fdot dftcp, W�r�g 

 in clouds with the slightest agitation, it j caused great inconvenience to both horse 

 ani rider. Consequently; Curlew tightened ! the ran, drawing- the horse up to the ordi 

 nary bush amble; and was considering - where he should turn off the road, to go the j moat direct route to the care, when his at tention was once more attracted, by a chance glimpse of a horseman, not far in front, leis urely rising a hill. This was sufficient to awaken his cautioa, and arouse his inquisi tive nature. He quietly followed for some 

 distance, sufficient to establish in his mind I that the horseman did not trarel in company nor. �PPear�l like & trooper in disguise; and. 

 deciding the tactics to pursue, he moved at a , 

 quicker pace, Boon getting -within a few { lengthsof Horace Bascombe, who was return ing from Melbourne. 

 * Hallo, old fellow,' Bascombe laid, 'vou are Hie bust one I Bhonld have thought of see ing-,' turning round to the new comer. * AI 

 though, really, I was just thinking 0f yOU and the other fellows. Them are fine times for your business.' 

 * How do, Bascombe F Curlew said, coldly, 

 as lie never trusted his acquaintance with the 1 same confidence with which Douglass and Warren received him. 41 suppose there are all sorts of yams flying about; and I'll bet with exaggerations. "What have you been doinsr IatelyP As to fine times, it's a precious too warm for any business.' 

 ' 1 have heard a lot about the gangs' do 

 ings ; the police are determined to hunt you j down,' Bascombe said. ' 

 ' It they are not very smart,' Curlew �ni<^ 41 guess tbey will be all shot.' 

 'lhear that Warren is often at Murphy's,' Basoom.be said, * much to Tiffins Murphyrs annoyance.' 

 * Yes,' Curlew said. ' I know he's made an awful fool of himself, in that Quarter, but he won't take advice.' 

 * He is veiy strong headed,* Bascombe said. * I might almost add, heartless ; and~0ne who would, do anything to gain his owu desires.' 

 * You're not far out' Curlew said. ' He's a terror in the gang, though he looks so soft and quiet. It was all his doing, that the firing took place.' Stopping liisthorse; 'and now X must say good morning, as I turn off here.' 

 �Weill, good bye, Curlew, remember me to the others,' Bascombe said. ' If I can serve any of you, drop me a line.' 

 'ThanksCurlew said. 'Now we sepa rate, soon I trust to m et again in security; or perhaps we part to meet no more.' 

 ' Why, do you intend to quit the country?' Bascombe asked 

 * Not exactly the" country,' Curlew said. * But I shall try to leave these parts; I am tired of this mode of living.' 

 4 Before you go,' Bascombe said; * we will have a parting nip,' taking s> Hask from his pocket and handing it to tue bushranger. 

 Curlew disappeared in the thick bush, can tering through break of timber and over the spurs, from the big ranges, occasional! r bending his head, to prevent contact with low hanging- branches, until compelled to go slower, by the densely packed undergrowth and^loose timber, the collection of ages. 

 He turned into a steep gully, with huge boulders, scattered on each side, and ancient stringy bark trees partly burnt stumps re winding one of fearful flame*, and clouds of burning embers, of the last bush fire; and selected a place to ascend the top ortlie ridge, where the blackened trunks and twisted branches were less impediments to the hor -e. He dismounted and unfastening one buckle of the reins from the bridle bit, commenced to climb the rusrgea bank, the horse following. 

 Arriving at a hind of series of terraces he saw that the top was not far distant, and re adjusting iihe reins, he sat upon a log to ze*t, previous to another start. 

 lighting his pipe and lightly placing his hand upon the horse's withers, he was again in the saddle, and Hector started into a baud gallop and proceeded along the rounded edge of die dangerous bank: when Curlew halted., looking around. 

 * Hector, old horse,' he said aloud, ' X guess we are a bit bushed. 1 am blessed if I haven't missed the old f>rked tree; never mind, we'll go back again.' 

 Turning the horse, he retraced his track for half a mile,'at a walk, until he reached a large gum tree, all crooks and forks before a copse of immense trees, extending along a 

 table land. Beaching the timber tie trotted 

 up and down the uneven country, then mak ing a dash down the head of a blind gully, to a patch of scrub, through which he scram bled, coming out in front of the Hanging Rock, the present home of Bora Bora. 

 The day was yet young, therefore he could afford, to wait awhile and see if,the v should 

 return 

 it was strange that both should be away. Something unusual may have happened to compel them to leave; he knew their habits. The ^ chief always went on the ' dunna' alone, unless when with the tribe. The tima passed dowly enough: nought but the dry looking scrub ,in front and all around, the cold looking rocks in the rear. No sound reached the bushman's ear, and save an oc casional lizard, emerging from under a shelv 

 ing rock, the scenery was barren. 

 As a rule, it is the practice of the old hand, and those born or bred in the bush, generally to take advantage of unoccupied time, by sleeping, when finding themselves in the po sition of Curlew. 

 Thus he indulged in'refreshing slumber, until the ran shining full upon his fane, awoke him. Standing up he plainly per ceived himself still alone. Mounting his horse he pushed through the intricacies of the everlasting scrub. Suddenly he met Bora Bora and his iubra, who told him that the police were patrolling the forest, and in which direction they were travelling. 

 'Have you seen whitefeller tracks along ranges?' Gurlewenquired. 

 * Ouai.' the blackfellow said. Plenty 

 yarraman long gully, one come abora like um big feller gully, way back, see budgery boomer. Ball me lift nm. Bora Bora show it whitefdler plenty money long gully.' 

 ' How far long a gully?' Curlew said. 

 ' Wilbra arrie ' Bora Bora answered; which interpreted, is little sun. or half a 

 day. 

 < You,' Curlew said; * stop long a gun yah, Curlew come long by um by, you no yan way.' 

 ' Ball,' Bora Bora said. ' My Eowani no like um cave gunyah; swears you away long a tribe.' 

 The bright eyes of the young girl Eowani flashed at Bora Bora, as she interpreted his 

 talk. 

 * Memora Wodlinia bacca.' Then speak 

 ing to Curlew; ' Ball me gitum bacca, Mas 

 ter Rudolph.' 

 ' Ball you,' Curlew said to Bora Bora, * take bacca, me give Eowari. Here's some for you Eowani,' giving her a few figs of 

 tobacco. 

 Curlew departed, impressing upr.n them not to leave their camp before his return. 

 He hurried away, as the sun was rapidly sinking to the tree tops, having to travel several miles to reach the bushrangers' cave. But owing to the great endurance of his horse, he arrived home as the ruddy sun was sinking in the brilliant west. 

 All the men came out to see who might be the late arrival. 

 ' Ah ! Curlew,' Douglass said. 4 What news from the front, as they say ?' 

 ' All sorts of news,' was the reply. * How have you fellows got on ?' 

 ' Ben, Warren and Hunter went for tucker,' Douglass said, ' and heird we are all to be taken, dead or alive. 

 'W� heard a^out your lark with the trav ellers," Warren said. 4 You made Pa* Mur phy ill with la ugl.ing.' 

 ' * I have not been to the Creek since your self,' Curlew said. 'I h�ard a lit about you and Flora, that wasn't any laughing matter; eh, Warren " 

 * She's a fool,' Warren said. ' Once we were great Mends, but now, it's a hard job to receive a reply; and if her lather isn't more civil, I'll not forget him.'
