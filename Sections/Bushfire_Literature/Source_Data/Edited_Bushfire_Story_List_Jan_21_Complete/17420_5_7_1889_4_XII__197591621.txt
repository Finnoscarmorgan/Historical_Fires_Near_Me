AN ODD LEGACY. 

 [BT H.W.] 

 CHAPTER XII. 

 It wu a month after the incidents of the preceding chapter took place. The tragedy had not been talked about. A doctor's certificate, a judicious use of palm oil, a little manoaurring her* and there, andthe suicide of Barbara fiolmes never assumed this proportions of a one day's wonder, let alone nine. It had been done, and it is doubtful if there were half a dozen people who knew there was any connection with the suicide and the brokers of CoHinS-street, and Miss Holmes. Things hnd prospered in the business of Messrs O'Byrhe'ft Poynton, undertbe management of Mr Green, nntii it had assomed each a magnitude that he advised them to float it into a company. Mr Poynton had made it known that he would give a large banquet; be was looked on as a man of fabulous wealth, and both he and bis partner were two of the most sought after amongst the Melbourne eKte. It was indeed a magnificent affair, and not one amongst the visitors could equal the beauty of Belle Holmes. She was Indeed a beautiful, aoiiable girl, and to see the way she treated her selfconstituted guardian was edifying ; sometimes she would approach him as a child does a father,' looking, ap into his bronzed features With her full eyes with such an air of truBt and child-like candour; at other times she would bang on his arm and tender her advice or sympathy like a wife indeed. George was troubled. He was awkwardly placed. " Belle," be was saying, " supposing anything happens to me what would you do ?" " Ob 1 don't talk like that; why do you ask?" M I should like to see you settled you know." There was a pained, puzzled expression about her face, difficult to understand, ahe:aaid," I am satisfied as I am, do you 

 want me to go away ?" " No, hardly, but you are being much �ought after, Belle, I am expecting every day fo hear some definite offer of marriage." " Why, you silly old thing I have had a dozen. Why, your partner, Barry, has made me two, and swears be will die if I keep on refusing him." There was an amused smile on George's faoe. " Barry," he said," would he not suit?" " Look here, Mr Poynton, 1 prefer to remain single for a time yet; please don't speak to me any more about it. 1 * " Wall, you are a strange little girl; I shall be' asking you myself one of these days" " What's that you said," Bhe asked, in a half whispering voice, coming closer. He repeated it; she looked np into his face. What a fool tbe man was. No, be could ^ 0se nothing, and yet the chances were if a dozen others had been there they would have interpreted it. " Why, leave it till some of those days," she whispered, " why not now. Do you love me ?" " More than I can tell," he answered, bending HTB head down to her's, and yet thinking all the while it was bat gratitude and pity on her part. Oh, how stupid some men are. " You love me V " Yes, I love you 1" " I know it, bow could I help it, and even with all tbe encouragement 1 have given you, you must make me suk for your heart. Oh, how dull you are. Wby, can't you see that I will marry no one else, because George Poynton I love you ; there how gratified you ought to feel. But yet your's is a heart worth any girl's asking, and I know you have been wooing in secret." " And can yon love me sufficient to take me for your husband," he said, hie forehead lowered to tbe level of hers. " Now you must take me for your wife." " Belle, I do love you, even ae I loved once before, and you say you requite it ?" " Why I loved you for weeks past, and have, wondered you did not see it." " Well, never mind, little one�never too late to mend ! To tell you the truth, I am getting heartily sick of Melbourne; I long for the wilds and adventures of the great lone bush. How would'you like to share a life up there ?" "The place of all above others I should 

 like�glorious, it would be " "Well' then, I have already bought one of the finest runs in tbe Southern Hemisphere, with a regular palace built on it; dog-kennels and hunters ; boats and boating; so naught is wanting. Then all we have to do is to get married and proceed to the station and enjoy ourselves to tbe best advantage. As for Barry, I I am sure I do not know what h� will do. I think he is infatuated with Melbourne." A few days after this conversation, Melbourne was startled by the announce- 1 ment of the marriage of George Poynton, of O'Byrne & Poynton, and Belle Holmes. The business in the mean time had been floated into a company, and after all was settled, the partners, in money and shares, divided the sum of �70,000�no mean advance on tbe capital of �20,000 in six months�George realised and went to his cattle station. Barry stayed in Melbourne. The estates he had left at home intact to try and work the mortgage off, a fact which would soon be accomplished. .Joyce married an actress; soon after he left, and wss shot at Monaco. Everything prospered with Gentleman George; not one of the many travellers of the bush .was ever sent empty away from hie station. As be was sitting under the verandah one day, a swagman passed the house and hurried on. Something in the figure attracted more than a passing attention from George. He called out to the fellow, but be never lifted bis bead and hurried along. Bnt George's curiosity was aroused, he was not to be so easily banlked, so be etarted after him, and soon overtook him. " Hultoa, my man, what's your hurry ? Have you been to the station, or are you intending to go on to-night ?" As be said this George lifted the old wideawake hat. The two looked at each other a moment�" Barry, as I Jive J Whv how's this, old chap?" " Oh, don't ask me, George�that cursed drink again, but let me go on." "Goon? Not to-night 1 Come, give ns your fist How are you, Barry, how are you, my boy ? No, you cannot, shall not go on," he continued, as Barry tried to move away, faintly saying "Good-bye" " Barry, do you think 1 could let you go? Would you leave me ? Come, be sensible 

 now." "Ob, I cannot, I am too degraded George," " Too degraded ? Look here, see that pair of open doors, go into them, promise roe, and we'll see if Barry is the degrade rascal he believes himself to be.V He watched him proceed to the place directed, and then going to his own room he brought a complete suit and went in to where poor Barry was sinking with shame. "Come now, see here, Barry," said George, opening a little door next to his study, there is a bath-room ; here, take these things they have never been worn. Now let u>e eee again Barry O Byrne, my one-time partner and my all-time friend." Almost without a word Barry Btepped into the room, and George amused himself by puliiBg down an album, turning it over till he came to a portrait he gazed at it. "My God! what a differeaco! Ob, 

 Lord, wbat degradation there is in drink." He was still looking at it when the door opened and Barry stood gazing. Their eyes met. �'George!" "Barry!" Hands clasped�still friends. No difference. Poor old Bany�a little bit more cadaverous and older looking, but yet with all there was the old bearing, inherited from proud ancestry. " Ha, that is more like," George said as he took his hand, "now look here, Bany, no more giving me the slip, dear boy. This is your home as well as mine. Two can run it as well as one." That evening the charm of music, and the sweet voice of his friend's wife caused all bis weak failings to fly. Barry was a man again; and inwardly declared town should see him no more. " You eee," he told George, " when you left I had not .a strong arm to help me, so I went in for a real carnival of gold, talk about money, George; thirty five thousand in about as many weeks; by jove, how it flew. But it was all vanity. I blazed like a meteor whilst I lasted ; when it was done I was Bhunned for my very prodigality by my friends." " And now, my dear boy, we will live comfortably here. I love the bush and to be amongst my horses and stock, I hate the town. Let us live quietly and with content; there's plenty of hunting. Five of the prettiest girk in the colony are over at M� � Station, and are often over here, if my Belle does not make up for her indifference and coldness in the past and bring about a suitable match, I'm a Dutchman." " No George, I don't think so." But nevertheless, in six months he had proposed to three in succession, and at last was duly accepted. One day, some three months after Barry's arrival, the two went for a trip to the place where the old tree stood�the mammoth monument of the legacy. Silent and grim it stood, with its blackened, cindered trunk scorched by a score of bush fires. That evening the ring of a couple of axes was heard echoing from the opposite banks of the river ; a tough job It waB, 

 but at last the hoary old stem tottered and fell, making the place echo again. Instantaneously both looked where the treasure bad formerly stood, but there was nothing, not a vestage of anything. " It seems we cleaned out pretty well, George," said Barry, " not a paper." " See, Barry, there's the little bole where we loaded tbe treasure in. Well, let us be off baok. Now we have out the old monster down I almost feel as if I had done something wrong, but I thought something might turn up." The two returned 5 a week or two after Barry was married, and six months after was part owner of his father-in-law's estate and at tbe present time they are as happy as CAU ba. Poynton's Station is reckoned amongst buBhmela BB a pleasant Arcadia. When expostulated with by other squattere for setting a bad example, he says, " Why should I not, I was a hushman once. Wby not share my wealth with them ? I do not want to hoard it, 'I can't take it with me. It's a pleasure for me. What do I gain by turning a poor devil away from my station ? No, they are welcome. They never take advantage of my hospitality. I have a man who I place trust in, and it is quite sufficient for me to know the}' are grateful for it. Why, am I not tbe gainer ? look when my run and my neighbor's was fired, I bad about a couple of hundred pounds damage done, and he had that many thousands ; why, because every man jack preferred to come and help me first. " Resides," be used to say "only for one of them, I should never have had my odd legacy and my present little wife. (THE END.)
