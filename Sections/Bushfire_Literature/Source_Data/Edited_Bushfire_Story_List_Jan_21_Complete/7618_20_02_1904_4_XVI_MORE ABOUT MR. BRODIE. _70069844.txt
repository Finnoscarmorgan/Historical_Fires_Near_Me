But as far as is loown to me, squatters in those days did not begrudge their hospitality, besides which, in Mhr. Brodie's case, be ing a bachelor, lie wounld be only too glad to have their company: It did not inat tar to hitu whether they were deserving or not, provided they dlid not play meani tricks on him they were always welcome. .I In that .rl, Ct, aset ing all other faults aside, he was a kindly-hearted,. geuerous man-none more so, and if some detemed him unduly harsh, the sordid: love of s money was not in the list of his sins. He fed them, and. when they slippedi their cables penniless he huried them at his own expense-at least, I know that he g,ve old Alick Stenhouse decent in terment at the bottom of the garden. Stenhouse, who was a shipmate of his to r 'asmania, arrived in that colony with a thousand .ponuds, and got through it; whereas lBodie, who landed penniless, ct areated an estate worth �20,000: The late Mr. Thomas Napier, a mise   rable old screw, a carpenter by trade, chanced to call upon our neighbour one day when the writer was at his place. I   was not introduced, but when the visitor had departed Brodie said - ' That is old Tommy Napier - he owns half a street in Melbourne and looks like a common bullock-driver.' He certainly did -- for a man of his wealth he was very meanly clad, and wore an ordinary Scotch twill   shirt - a garment once greatly in vogue with those who lived in the bush. Mr. Brodie wore garments of good material,   but as a rule they seemed to fit him very   badly. He invariablly sported a coat, even in the old times ; but I saw him woolrolling at his old place just after the   outbreak of the diggings sporting a blue serge shirt worn outside of his other garments.   From my knowledge, the blue serge   shirt worn as an overall was universal; and it was a modification of the English smock-frock, seeing it was cut much   shorter than that affected by the British   farm labourer. In my boyhood's days, my father when at home sported the blue serge shirt - s o did the Messrs Page, Mr. George Evans, and John Headlam--but the last-named once came to our place arrayed in a red one. Of course shepherds, hutkeepers, and the great bulk of the horny-handed sons of toil whose associations lay in the country   affected this form of outward adornment. It was a very comfortable garment, for the wearer was not crampcd up as we we are in coats at the present day, and   if made of first-class material it would   turn off a heavy shower of rain as I have proved.   Divers of the ex-convicts, from what   the writer has seen, were doubtless   weather-proof old fellows, for though   they sported a Scotch twill shirt with a blue-serger over it, both were worn open down to the last button, displaying sun- tanned hairy chests. Others wore a vest, and for winter wear, leather legg ings reaching to mid-thigh and held up with straps attached to the waist-belt.   As I am on. the habiliments of half a   century ago, ait may be' as well tooen lighten the reider'on the rig-out of' Big .Clarke' !in the year of grace 1852. My father had come down specially from - Bendigo in May of the above year to .square up for- the homestead section of O 640 acres, and perhaps it was getting on towards spring when down sails Mr. .Clarke from Belinda to asoertain upon Swhich side of the'road wq would-titke up our ashare of grass rieh M ere the reader most be informe that, becoming at the holders of 640' acres' 6f land in fee i. simple. we became legally entitled to t a grass right of another 1920 aeries if we could get themi ;; bat in getting this grazing right we would have to pay the quattinsg assessments till the Orwnl sold the land,- Had we been treated jistly we would have held all. the balance ofunssold.cmwnu lands heloeing t bee, 185M;' but I su hrpoe 1 a - ing taken up the 8peoid 8urvey in 1851 it gave him the, sidvantage-yet to give hin' due eredit:he .aceted pquarely by usa Well, pater: tbing at the dlggiiings Clarke no doubt pointed out to the mater that it would suit all parties best if we took aup' ior shareof 'grass righton, the Jackson's 'Creek'.side-o' the Bulla . road, whilst he took that en: the Emu' in Greek side of it. "' ' . To digress.

To return to Big Clarke. His foot   gear was a pair of heavy watertight lace   up boots, and his big legs were encased in moleskin trousers - presumably once white ones, but the colour was now be yond identification, because they were plentifully bespattered by the slush of the sheepyard. That day, in drafting,   every shepherd to be lugged out by the     

 hind leg, therefore when the catching pen was sloppy, the liquid mud flew   around considerably. From what is re     collected of his nether garments they werenot patched, yet with the blue serge           shirt thrown in, both were full of years   and dirt. I fancy he sported a vest;     the shirt under the blue outsider was of   the universal Scotch twill, and around his throatt he wore the Iarge triangular- cut black satin neckcloth - which latter, by the way, did not owe him anything,     for it had seen service. We now come to the adornment of his brainpan, in the once universal cabbage-tree hat-with   him a covering of such high antiquity. that I can best termr it a hoary Egyptian relic, weighing duble its original weight with the sOllidifidrl sweat of its wearer's mighty money-making head. In the words of Tommy Weddell (otherwise Weadell, one of Brodie's loafers), por tion of the brim had become unattached, while the circular comniencement of the crown had sailed away goodness knows when. I imagine this ornate specimen of headgear had some sort of a band round it. The picture of the man would not be complete unless we describe the Sfixings of the horse he rode. The bridle looked old enough to have come out of some curiosity shop. Its chinstrap, to say the least of it, was .most unique, for it was a strip of blackl woollen.rag, evid d ently torn from a woman's worn-out gown. The saddle beggars description, for lit was a miracle bow it held .togetber; --and we will finish our account of it'in saying +it was the light of other days.. 'The spot value of the accoutrements of theoman and steed would be zbout thirty. shillings. Mr. 'Big' Clarke, vulgarly speaking, was a leary man, seeing thiat his horse and all others then on Boliuda had their tails flounced-a plan that did.not beau tify the animals, but one that served A 6 useful purpose in' provedring them from being stolen. Some may think that the writer is too 0 minute in the description given of Mr a Clarke's habiliments ; but: ss a faithful historian it is necessary that his dress and that of some. of those who followed pastoral occupations in the long ago should he accurately, described. Above all others lie could well afford costly e raiment; but in that day.: ineonimon with other squatters wlien on their sta r tions, as all took a hand in sheep work, the rough garb of the time, if not orna t mental, had the merit of hbeing useful. n Then the cabbagetree hat was greatly in r vogue, and as a" head-covering it was very durable, but : unless it Ilhad a chin strep, it was precious apt to.make an e excursion on its own account if a strong wind blew. It was banded with a broad black ribbon -fixed in the form of a bow, *y with two fairly long streamers, swallow t, forked at their ends. The cabbage tree n belongs to th,, palm tribe, and by oa. 10 counts from old stagers was once very to plentiful about Illawarra and the Five ir Islands in the Sydney ,country ; and perhaps from wanton destruction of the ;e tree, hats made, from its flaglike leaves 1; in the process of time ran up to the price h of a decent suit of clothes those days. There was a good iulitatioq of the cab bage-tree bat made' out of Brab,: bit these did; not 'wear - ahove, well. For Sfoo:ga'rniture, when. it came to the iquestion . of saddle work, ,half .or full n Wellington boots were'in request, and a when my father joined Pyke's Hounds. * in 1848 hebhad a pair made of kangaroo e leather.
