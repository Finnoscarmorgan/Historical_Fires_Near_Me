No 011.' knows what brought him there, and, the sir myest part of it is, ho had a lot of goldonhiniwlien he was killed, in bars au<i mur^ol.s." " Gold In bars and nngfjets the old mau cried, springing- to his foot with a fierce gleam in his eyes. '' Where did he sret the gold from Where did he get the gold, I say?" �'Don't got ex'-itod, Hillon," said the farmer, who thought the old in:in was in one of his peculiar moods. " No one is able to answer that question. I lo liad u�ne when he left hero, so his brother siys: and it's not- to be supposed he had, because there is 110 gold around Carlsriiho such as liiiirgets and bars. Perhaps he robbed a minor," lie concluded, with a laugh. "Robbed: ayo. robbed I that's what he imist have done, lio never i-jnv by it honestly ; and he paid the penalty of his treachery. When was he killed r" " Nearly three weeks ago. On Wednesday night fortnight, it is said," answered the neighbor. " "Wednesday nighl ?" mused ITilion, with a savage look in his eyes. Wednesday is an uidu-ky day. It is 1hc unlucky day. It's all nonsense to *�y Friday is." " I think every day is as wo in il;e il," answered the hones!; far;n'-r, srnl";il ioiisly. " O.ie day is as good as another or as bad as another, :ts the case may bo." ". " No, they are not," said ] lilfon. fiercely, " I t-?ll you Wednesday is the unlucky day. But," ho added, turning the conversation, " Tou say they are going to hang a man for killing Trovasciis. Where did you get that information ?" " The whole account of the triai is in this morning's piper," said the neighbor, taking o Melbourne publication out of his pocket, and h'-uidi 'i g i 1to him. " Ail the pa rticula rs are ttior: ami yon can have a loan of it until you conn over and see mo." Saving: which the farmer bid the sorrowful-looking man good morning mid went away. Thero v.-:i = 111 to than the particulars in the paper. It, contained numerous letters from correspondents, .-suggesting how the intu - - dered man may have become possessed of the gold, and the unanimous opinion was expressed thai (lie most probable theory was that in some manner ho had discovered the treasure hidden by Black Douglass and his J&ng- A late paragraph even stated that some of the gold found near the wood-cutter's hut had been identified by bank officials mini the private mark on it as having been in charge of the robbed escort. Hilton carefully road the lengthy report of the trial and the comments on it. At various points he stopped, with a frown 011 his 

 pinched and haggard face, and remained in deep thought for several minutes. lie appeared to be trying to till up a blank in his mind. At length, after reading' the account over a second time, he laid down the paper and svid aloud: " Trovascus left here the same night as I did, and he must have boon watching and followed me. He must have soon me preparing to go, and if he followed ho must have seen the gold. When I went away he must have robbed me," he continue !, with dviwhcd teeth : "he was sirong.'r than m* a-id could easily have taken away the boxes : but what did he do with them r He would, of course, ..take as much gold as he could conveniently carry awav with him ; but what did he do with the r :.-t r" Then, after a time, fee resumed his muttered reverie: " He was hurt, so perhaps he was attacked by some one and robbed, as he robbed me '. But I don't tnink so. Bob Trevas-jiis would only give up such a treasure as that with his life. Such a treasure!"' and the old man's eyes lit up with a preternatural litrht and his lingers clinched tightly as he thought of the bars and nuggets of gold. "If he was not robbod the gold must be somewhere between the gaily and the wood-cutter's hut. The �wood-cutter's hut?" ho repeated, with a troubled expression 011 his face. "Where have I seen that hut? It seems to me that I have known it in a dream. for somehow the plii.ee is familiar to me ; and yet I don't recollect being at it. I must go to it and make another search. I can't stop away from"that place now. It will haunt me until I am in the grave. But I won't die yet, not for a long time, for many and many a year," he muttered, with a look of avarice in the aged face painful to behold. " And they're going to hang a man for killing Trevascus ? I do not think he should be hanged. Perhaps he did not kill him. Blackburn ? Blackburn ? I don't know the name; but I hope "�and the same queer look came into the eyes� " they won't hang him. He may be innocent: and,at any rate,the sneaking robber deserved death. If I had caught him "�the old man cried savagely, as he jumped hj his feet�" I would have choked hini to death as sure as my name is Hilton'." The solitaiy dweller in the hut went inside and sat down by the lire-less hearth. For hours he remained there immovable and, at Ifength, his mind being apparently decided, lie went outside and looked up at the sky. "ISTot to-night, not to-night-!" he muttered, " for to-morrow will be Wednesday, aud that is my unlucky day. I must wait another 21 hours and then another seuroli for my stolen gold'." As some people, by constantly repeating a lie, at last believe it to be true, so Hilton, by ever thinking of the stolen treasure, had come to regar.l it a.j his own rightful property, interference with which being a crime to be punished with death. The loss of it had driven him temporarily insane, and for a couple of days he had wandered through Clio bush without food: but starvation, which will tame a wild boast�and a human being in t'mt condition is little better�brought liim to his senses again, aud after a lengthy Heareh for the boxes he returned unsuccessful a id broken hearted to his home at Carlsruh"\\ Two days afterwards the hut was again vacant, for the occupant had onco more enter vl the Blade Forest to search amidst its fuiiglel ravines and ranges, clothed with towering eucalypti, for the blood-stained and fatal tr Msuiv. Verily, it was seeking 1 for a needle in a bundle of straw. 

 CHAPTER XVIII. CIIANCE on DESTINY. It is a moot point whether Chance or Destiny control human affairs. Ferhaps the two words mean the same, and events which are really set down to chance have been predestined from all time. If man bo a five agent it appears very curious that his whole life should be swayed and shaped by some chance event which ho never expected nor wished for: yet, if we trace back the devious road of human life we will invariably find that the straight path 011 which we started out from our cradle has at some part or another been suddenly blocked bv some chancc obstacle, and our course turned off at a tangent. Sometimes we have nearly passed all the milestones on the journey of lif s before this turning point is reached, whilst; frequently we aro hardly out cf tight of the cradle before wo aro called upon to travel along a path very different from that mapped out for us. Wc are blind gToper.- in the dark. We cannot see the distance of our nose ahead with certainty, aud every step forward wo give loads us from the light, of the present to the darkness of the future. No man can say what the morrow will bo, and, chance or destiny, which ever you like to call it, rules our life. John Hilton was a striking instance of this assertion. It was cither destiny or chance that threw him in the way of Maguire the bushranger, at the " Travellers' Host " shanty, and tho impulse which moved him. to assist the attacked man was responsible to a groat extent in shaping his future 1 !{��>. MaguireV, well-meant present was to him a fital gift in the end, for it disturbed the clear and Berene current of his life an 1 filled the p'-riod of his declining years with trouble and gloom. Previous to the possession of tho paper giving a clue to the buried treasure Hilton was an easy-going, contented man. Amidst the all-absorbing fever of the early golddiscovories, lie was content to remain on his little farm at Carlsruhe whilst others were madly packing up and scampering away to the " diggings," and it was nearly 10 years after the first, excitement had died away that (more for a change than from any motives of avarice) he decided to pay a short visit to Boudigo and try his luck at fossicking." It was 011 this ill-starred journey that the momentous event of his life occurred,and t.he contented old man was transformed into a restless, uuliappy miser. From the day he left tho "Travellers' Rest" he never knew what it was to have a contented mind. He spent his waking moments in day-dreams and his sleep was visited with gorgeous visions nf unbounded wealth, lie had the Philosopher's Stone, so he thought., iu the Hood-stained package the dying man had given him ; and tho golden dreams of his youth would bo realised. Like the Israelites in tho desert, when Moses left them, he ceased to worship the true God and set up for himself a graven image of gold aud, like them, his punishment was swift and severe. For a weary year he searched unsuccessfully for the buried treasure, and when he found it in the strange manner he did � when the fiery-cross shone before his eyes in the depth of the night�it was only to lose it the same day, and in a most unaccouutable manner. Twice since that miserable day ho had again visited the place where ho had discovered tho gold, and spent days in vainly .searebiug for it. Now, 1:1 months after his first discovery� aud loss �he was again camped in the narrow glen known as " Stringy-bark Gully," bent upon smother search after the gold which ho still fancied must be buried somewhere in the neighborhoo 1. He had pitched a small tent in the glaie where he first camped and, as the sun was sinking in the west, he sat with 1 towed head in front of a blazing fire he had made and looked at the embers as if he would again find inspiration in their fiery characters. 

 Day disappeared and the long shadows became merged iu the general gioom, and still the white-haired old man sat with bent head and folded arms gazing intently at the fire. As the night wore on he began to talk aloud,as if lie were addressing an unseen companion. " The gold is mine I"" ho muttered. " Yes, mine. I must find it. Where can it be, I wonder 'i Wiiat a fool I was to leave it as I did. I might have known it was not safe to go away for a moment from such a prize ; but I will find it yet. I was a year searching before I got it at first, and it is just a year now since 1 lost it. Bat I must sleep ; yes, sleep ! for I will want .1 sharp eye tomorrow ; and th" lire tolls 111^ nothing!" As ho finished talking he glanced reproachfully at the blazing logs, as if offended at them not suggesting the whereabouts of the lost treasiu' ', and then he stood up and went into the tent. As the first streak of dawn broke in the cast he was astir and, after preparing a rough breakfast, he walked round the tent in an uncertain maunci two or three times and then stool and refl-v-ted. The back of the tent, which was cut down," he said aloud, " faced this way, so the thieves must have taken the gold out that way, and most likely they earned it further into the forest. Tile}' conldn't have re-buried it in the gully, so I will take this direction to-day and try my luck," lie concluded,looking to tho north and iu the very direction tho gold had ae-tuaily been taken. With eager eyes he carefully ase.mdcd the steep hill, scanning the ground most minutely. Ho reached the top aud descended into the next gully,looking into every thicket and watching for the least signs of disturbed e;u-lh. On he wont, with the pertinacity of a sleuth-hound, aud almost with the same instinct. IL: p issed by the cultivated ground on Sheridan's farm and round the base of the Round Hill and into a deep glen 011 the other side. Tiiis dark ravine looked a likely place for a " plaut," he thought, and lie examined it with tho greatest care. He was going cautiously throu-di some thick scrub when he nearly stumbled into a hole which was almost hidden by tho long rank grass aud luxuriant creepers. Saving liiinsi-lf wi-h difTWlty, he got a long stick and, parting the vegetation which covered the hoi-, tried to ascertain its depth. He found it was not mors than three feet deep, and it had evidently been formed by the up-rooting of a latgo tree, which had since b.-cn d-str�y..>d by the numerous bush fires. Using the stick vigorously, he broke away most of the �?r i.ss aud creepers and then, kneeling down, struck a mutch to explore the excavation, as the thick undergrowth enveloped it iu gloom. For a few m nneiits he could distinguish nothing, but at last his eyes reslttl on a slight protruberJ.uce at the bottom nf the hole on 0110 side. He took up tho fticfe and began poking at it, and in a few moments he felt .something hard under th<> soft earth. With a slight gleam of interest lighting up his haggard face, the old man s;;oop?d aw-iy the debris, and as ho did so he found that the object he was feeling, whatever it might be, was wooden. A few more thrusts with the. stick and the square outlines of a b<>-< becaun- visible and, unable to control his excitement, Hilton jumped into the hole with an agility beyond his years. With a suppressed or} - nf terror, he clambered out again with lightning-like rapidity, just in time to avoid the dart of an enraged 

 snake, which r.-.ientel iiitorfcr.-nee with its ho:ii->. With b; ids of p-rspir ition on his face at the narrow escape lie bad had, for the r -ptil � was of the tiger species and most venomous, Hilton stood for a few s�eoicls to recover himself and then, seeing a large stone a. few yards away�for he could not use tlie stick effectively iu the hole, he piek.-l it. up and, waiting his opporiuui!y, d.>-;!ie.l il down on tho snake, breaking its In k. Tliis done, he had little difficulty in ,1 spj 1 hing it outright. Carefully examining the hoi", (<� make sure the dead reptile had no c:e:ip rii ms.the an :;ious man again deseended m l. quickly s.-r.ipingaway theearth, he gave .1 wild cry of joy, as he saw before him 0110 ot' the mis -ing treasure boxes, which he kn so well, for they were graven on his m -mury. Tho revulsion of his long-pent-up feelings was so gr at that he be.�am'? i'iint and, dropping heavily on the box, ho remained motioiiloss f..r a full half-Lour, with his fixed and sta: >ng eyes looking on tho snake, which sliil shoivod some siirus of lit' �. CIIAPTKR XIX- Tin: i;EOI.\\-.\\iN-A O? TIN: exd. As lie gradually recover \\1 his strength he liftc 1 out. the box, which had apparently not been covcred in the first instance, but concealed by-the loose earth W'IHI foil in from tin: sid; s of the hole, and placed it oil tho surface. Thai, getting a sharp stick, ho rooted about in all directions in search of the oilier boxes, but without finding any trace of them. Weary with his exertions and the emotion of thus au ldenly recovering part of the lost treasure, which I10 had come to regard as his own prop 'l-ty, he sat down beside the box and examined it. He found that, it had been broken open, for a piece of the wood came away easily when he touched it, and he found that a small portion of the contents had been taken, for the box was not quite full. Ho then began to theorise as to how the gold came there and who had taken it from him. " It mini have been Trevascus," he mutt-red. " Tiiey say that wh 11 ho went to the wood-eult'-r's hut I10 complained of having hurt his back by falling into a hole. I read that in the paper, now I recolle -t. If he was carrying this box in the dark and walked into the hole here, it would have boon almost enough to kill him. When he fell he must have opened the box and taken some of the gold out and left the box here, expecting to get it iu a few days, when he was well. If that be "so, the other boxes must bo bet ween here aud my tout," he went on, theughtfully. Then he raised his head, as he said : " The wood-cutter's hut must be somewhere near-'hero. Ah, that is it," ho exclaimed, as he looked iu a northerly direct iou and saw the bark roof of a hut through tho trees, about 300 yards distant. I will take the box there and arrange this gold so that I can carry it easier, and perhaps I may get a clue which will help me to lind the remainder." lie proceeded at once to put this idea into execution and, lifting up the bos with some difficulty�for the old man was very weak � ho carried it to war Is the hut . There was not the least sign of life about the desolat" place, and the door stood partly ajar. Placing the box behind a log, the suspicious nnii went knyarJ.-s the hou;;o to reconnoitre, and on entering found it quite deft -rte I. There were fresh a?.-hes in the fireplace, he notice 1, but that was 110 doubt caused by some sir ty traveller who had camped there for a night. Going back for the box, lie re-entered the hut aud, after closing the door, placed it on the rough table which still remained in the rosin. In a few minutes lie v.-cut outside again and carefully surveyed the surrounding 

 locality, to see if anyone might be about. As he walked round the hut it seemed strangely familiar to him. " I have never beeu here before and yet I seem to know the place," he said. [Hilton had been at the hut before, but it will occur to the reader that he was in a state of temporary insanity, which clouded his ipemory so_ far, as some of the incidents which occurred on the night when he lost the gold.] Going to a small window iu the side he looked in and saw the box on the table quite distinctly. " I luust have seen this house in my dreams, for oven this window I recollect. Vvliy should the place seem so familiar to me? It's an ouion of either good or ill," :;ai�l the superstitious mau, and it must be for good, because my luck is iu to-day. If it was Wednesday, now ! Ah I Wednesday ! that is my evil day'." Muttering like this, Ilillon passed round the house until he came to the "lean-to." Finding that empty, and the doorway covered with cobwebs, he felt secure from intrusion and went into the house. Taking oft' the loose piece from the box, he at once commenced to stow the gold about his person in the most convenient manner. Finding a piece of strong canvas in one of the former bedrooms, with the help of some string which he carried, he made a rough sort of bag, which would be easier to carry than the heavy box, and would not attract attention. After filling all his pockets and placing some inside the breast of hi* shirt, he managed to pack the rest into the bag. "I will burn this box," lio said, "and that will remove a possible danger of discovery." lie gathered up some rubbish from the floor aud, breaking up the now useless but lately much-sought-after box, lie placed it iu the fireplace and applied a match. There was an old stool in the room and, drawing it near the bla/\\ he sat down - feeling more secure�to rest, for he felt quite worn out. The long search after the gold, with the restless, sleepless nights and neglect of food, had greatly sapped the old man's strength, lie was, in fact, hurrying himself to the grave as fast as he could. Like many others who thirst for wealth, he was goiug the way that led to the grave, and in tho end would find, like so many do, that in grasping at tho substance ho had missed it, and found instead the shadow of death. As he sat, before the cheerful blaze � the only cheerful object about - he fell into a fitful slumber, with the b ig of gold clasped in his right hand. On the edge of the dealing which surrounded tho hut and facing the doorwaj. an evil-looking man -who was none otherThau Gerald Arimtage, who was on a visit to Sheridan's farm iu tic vi-iuity had watched Hilton walking round tic house aud examining the locality. " What, the* mischief is that fellow doing there ? He s-ems to bo up to something," said the crouching man. As Hilton cnt.T hut aud closed the door Annytago rase fr.im his hiding-place and, making a i/r/ jnr, went round tho scrub until he came to the back of the hut. Then he boldly walked out on the cleared space and went over to the building. Ho listened for a i'"W moments at the ba- k and then cautiously male 'lis way to the side whore the small window spoken of before was situated. ITo carefully looked in thr--u;;h the gb,-s - for Hilton lia.I forgotten to cover it�and saw the old man packing away the contents of the box.�To BK CONTINUED. SCO !�' 110
