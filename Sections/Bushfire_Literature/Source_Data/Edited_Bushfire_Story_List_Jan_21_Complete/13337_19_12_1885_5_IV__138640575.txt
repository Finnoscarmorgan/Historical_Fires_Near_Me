 On the morning after his arrival the visitor.

 "I was very young when he left home, tat I always heard that he was a hard man to bat at anything he chose to go in for.' 

 "He was as fine a man as ever wore Bhoe lather," said the overseer. " Everybody re jected him in these parts, and he was that jdly and kind in his ways nobody could help lug him.' I� he hadn't been cut off in his simebj that infernal 'doctor'-the cattle duffing horse-stealing bound--'he'cl have leenone of tbe richest men in the district tiiivery minute." 

 "He was shot by a highway robber?" in quired Devereux ; "what you call a bush 

 ivnger in Australia, don't you ?" j 

 Well! there are bushrangers and bush nngera," said the overseer. "This chap, 'the Doctor,' hadn't regularly took to the tat, as one might say, though he was worse tamany as did. He belonged to a mob of attle stealers that used to duff cattle in the W: country, and pass them over to Queens y.

 am arose early in the morn 

 idr, according to his wont, all things were coveted with an icy mantle. On one occa sion,' when he met Mr. Gate ward coming in from a long night ride, his abundant beard was frozen stiff as a stalactite. 

 The sheep died faster than ever, at which Berham wondered much, but did not ask questions. "Everything comes to him who waits," was one of his favourite provetbB. 

 " If it had been always thus," he told him Belf, " so many evidences of capital and pro sperity would not be here. A change will come some time, but I cannot hasten it by ignorant queries. I shall learn all about this 

 extraordinary country in the course of 

 time." 

 His theory was sound. But Mrs. Devereux was neither so self-contained nor philoso phical. She complained and bemoaned her self from time to time, as is the way of women. At the evening meal, when after the day's djities the two young people and her self met with an affectation of social enjoy ment, she made many thingB'plain to the in quiring mind of Bertram Devereux, silent and incurious as he seemed to be. 

 "It bad not always 4)een thua. In the old happy days droughts had certainly occurred, but with intervals of years between. Now the seasons seemed to have changed. The year before last was a drought, and now this was the most sore and terrible grass famine which she ever remembered. Their 

 losses would be frightful, disastrous, 

 ruinous." 

 "Was it on the cards that she would actually be ruined ? lose all her property that is, if the season remained un 

 changed ? 

 "Well, not absolutely. She could not truthfully say that Even if all the sheep at Corindah died, the whole fifty thousand, tbe land and the fences could remain. But twenty or thirty thousand pounds would be an immense sum to make up. The very 

 thought made her shudder. To think of the years it had taken to make and save it! No doubt she could get more sheep. Her credit, she was thankful to say, was good 

 enough for that" 

 " I believe it's all Mr. Gateward's fault," said Pollie, impetuously. " Why did lie per suade you not to buy a station in the moun tains last year, where there's beautiful green grass and running water in the driest sum mer. That's what is needed for the poor sheep now. And all for a thousand 

 pounds." 

 "A thousand pounds is a great deal of money," said Mrs. Devereux. "He thought he could get some country cheaper, and in the meantime'it was snapped up. I have been sorry for it ever siuce. But he meant well, 

 as he always does." 

 " I know that lie's as good an old creature as ever lived, and devoted to you and me, mother. I wouldn't say a word against him for the world. But he's too slow and cautious in matters like this which need decision. Think of all the poor, weak sheep, with their imploring eyes, that would have been kept alive if we had sent twenty or thirty thousand up to those lonely mountains." 

 " I suppose it's too late now," said he. Of course I know nothing as yet, but could not some of them, 10,000 or so, be taken 

 away now." 

 " That's where the misery is," said Pollie. "The snow is beginning to fall on the moun tains. Indeed, nearly all the sheep have come away. Those 30,000 of Mr. Haller's that passed here last week, and gave you so much trouble, had just come from there. And how nice and strong they were; do you remember ? Our poor things are so weak that they couldn't travel if we had ever so much green grass to send them to." 

 "It's Napoleon's Kussian campaign over

 again, then, only thftt our country's too dry to bold us, and his was too cold. And ia there no return from Elba? " 

 '' When the rain comes; not before. It may come soon, in a few months this year, next year not at all. So we're in a pleasing state of uncertainty, don't you think ?" 

 "And you are not all sitting in sackcloth and ashes, or fasting, and making vows to the saints, and what not 1 This is a wonderful country, and you are wonderful people, I must say, to take matters so calmly." 

 "Weknow our country and the general course of the season," said Mrs. Devereux. " In the long run they prove favourable, though the exceptional years are hard. And we strive to have faith in God's providence, believing that whoso trusts in Him will 

 not be left desolate." 

 Letter from Miss M. A. Devereux' to Miss 

 Clara Thornton,-Fairoalts, Edgeeliff-road, 

 Sydney. 

 " My Darling Clara,-I hope you think of me daily, nightly, at breakfast and lunch time ; also at midnight when you can look out o your bedroom window, and see that lovely South Head beacon light and the star BhowerB gleaming on the wavelets of the bay. When you can inhale the strong sweet ocean breath, and dream of far away tropic isles I and palm groves, coral reefs, pirates, too, 

 romance. How you ought to pity me, shut up in poor, dry, dusty Corindah! The weather going from bad to worse ! Mother and Mr. Gateward looking more woe begone every day, and the poor sheep dying at such a rate that even as we sit in the house odours are waffed towards us not exactly of Araby the Blest. Bertie calls it 'bouquet de 

 merino.' 

 " Who is Bertie ? Did I not tell you before? He is the English cousin who has come to live with us and learn how to make a fprfiane by keeping sheep in Australia." What is he 

 like? of course you ask. Well, he is not a great many things. So he is not a hero ol romance, ready-made tor the consolation of your poor friend, in this famine year. He is not handsome, nor tall, nor clever-that is brilliantly so. Nor a particular admirer of his poor Australian cousin either. He is very cool and undemonstrative ; lets you iind out his talents and strong points by degrees, accidentally, as it were. If I were to describe him more accurately than in any other way that occurs to me, I should say he is different from everybody else I have ever seen in this colony-extremely well able to take care of himself under all circumstances, and quite careless as to the effects he produces. 

 "He is very well educated-cultured, I might say; reads and speaks French and German. So, as we have absolutely nothing to do in the evenings, he reads with me, and I get on a great deal faster than any of us did at Miss Watchtower's. You know I have always had a passion for what is called 'seeing the world.' It seems to be born in me, and I can recollect when I was quite a little thing being far more interested in books of travel than any other reading. I really believe that if anything led to the station being sold, and we have any money left after these frightful droughts, that I shall per suade mother to take me 'home,' as we Aus tralians always say, and then have a good satisfactory, leisurely prowl all over Europe. Now, do you see what I am coming to ; what is the use of seeing everything in dumb show ? I intend to work hard, very hard, at language now I have the chance. Then I shall be able to enjoy life, and instruct my mind fully when I do go abroad. Abroad! Rome, Paris, Florence! The idea is too ecstatic altogether. I shall die if it is not realised. I feel as if I should die of joy if it is. 

 " I am writing at my little table in my bed 

 room. As I look oat, the moonlight makes everything nearly as clear as day. There is a slight breeze, and I can actually see the dost as it rises on the plain, midwinter though it is supposed to be. I could'nt live here all my life, now, could I ? Not for all the sheep and cattle in Australia! I don't feel much inclined to go to bed. But I suppose I must say good night to my dearest Clata, and remain your too lonely friend-POLLIE." 

 After the first month or two of the excite ment caused by the arrival of a " new chum" at Corindah on the experience ticket, as the vernacular of the West Lc>gan had it, much of the mingled curiosity, doubt, or disapproval with which the emigrant gentle man is usually regarded in a distant pro vincial circle, died away-of this last attri bute of the neophyte Mr. Devereuz had in curred but little. Studiously careful of speech, habitually courteous in bearing, and wholly indifferent to general opinion, but few men with whom he wasbr mght into contact could find anything tangible upon which to found depreciatory opinion. The utmost that pro fessional carpers and' cynics could aver amounted merely to an inability to " make him out," as they phrased it, coupled with a lurking suspicion that he " thought himself a. deuced deal too good for the district of West Logan ana the people that belonged to it" 

 "Confound him," said Bob Barker, who posed as a leading society man and arbiter elegantarium: " what right has he to come here and look down on the lot of us as it we were a lot of small farmers or country bump kins ? Suppose he was in the .Guards, there's nothing so wonderful about that. I kno^r his mother was a lady in her own right, but a gentleman is only a gentleman, and other people have relatives in the aristocracy as well as him." 

 Here Bob* twisted MB moustache, and looked proudly around the company, squat 

 ters, magistrates, and others, a select party of whom, this being court day at Wannonbah, had assembled in the parlour of the principal 

 hotel. 

 " Are you quite sure that he does look down, as you call it, upon all of us fellows, Barker, or did you only think it was ten to one he would ? " Baid one of the assembled mag nates, a native-born Australian, with a slow, monotonous intonation, which did injustice to a shrewd intellect and somewhat keen sense of humour. " You know we are rather rusty, some of us. We've been so long away from England." Here the speaker bestowed a wink of preternatural subtlety upon a good humoured-looking, middle-aged man who occupied the chair at the head of the table. 

 " Rusty be hanged !" said Mr. Barker. " I could go home and take my position in so ciety to-morrow as if I had never left. I don't want any young military puppy to teach me 

 manners. 

 " But-what-did-he-do, Barker ?" in quired the other squatter ; or-what-did -he-say-that-put-your-monkey-up ?" 

 "Well, of course he didn't do any thing, and as for saying-he was infernally polite ; but somehow I knew by the quiet simple way he spoke what he was thinking of. And then, when we were playing whist-Atherstone and I-with Miss Devereux and the old lady, he looked on until I asked whether he approved of our play. He smiled faintly, and then begged to know whether' out here,' we were always in the habitof leading from our longest suits? I could have kicked him on the spot" 

 " But-perhaps-he-only-wanted-to know," pursued his tormentor, who now ap peared honestly desirous of extracting in formation. " You're BO-very smart-Barker -yoursel f-you-know." 

 " Oh,tI dropped down to him," said Barker. 

 "They've got some confounded new-fangled way of calling for trumps in these London clubB, and of course, like all English people, he think a we never hear anything or read anything, and have never Been any decent society-man for a century but himself. Why, wasn't General Burstall here the other day on leave from India. Saw my brother at Simla just the week he left However, wait till this season's over. That'll take some of the starch out of him." 

 " It'll-take-the-starch-out-of-some -of-us-too," replied the first speaker, " if -it-doesn't-break- up -soon. I've-lost -six-thousand-pounds-worth-of-cattle -already. Everybody-says-your-frontage ^looks-frightful-Bar-ker ?-eh ?" 

 The intense gravity and slow solemnity with which this sudden assault was per formed upon Mr. Barker, impugning the character ot his run. and by implication his probable solvency, appeared so over poweringly ludicrous to the company, that a diversion was effected in favour of Mr. Barker's pasturage, who, therefore, permitted the personal questions to lapse. 

 Letter from Mr. Devereux to Captain Goodwood, 6th Dragoon Guards 

 "Corindah, New South"Wales, Australia, 

 " May, 1877. " My Dear Charlie, 

 ! t" Partly on account of a weak promise to let you and one or two more of the old set into the secret of my other-world life when I said good-bye th" week after that fatal Derby that proved such a smasher, partly because one has such enormous quantities of spare time in the desert, here I am, going to pro duce a respectable despatch-may even go the length of becoming a regular correspon dent while quartered here. 

 "My jottings down, apart from any per sonal interest which may yet survive the writer's departure, ought to possess a certain value as tidings from a far cotintry, descriptions of a mode of life and state of society of which no one I ever met in England had the faintest idea. It is odd, too, for how many youngsters from good families that we. know have emigrated within the last ten years ! And with one or two exceptions there was no gleaning any information from their friends. Either the fellows didn't write or had done indifferently, and so the less Baid the better, or else the friends hardly could tell whether they lived in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, or Tas mania, which is much as if the whereabouts of a continental traveller should be described indifferently as in Belgium, Berlin, Swit zerland, or Sicily. There is a want of thoroughness and exactitude about our countrymen, I must say, in all ,Q)&tfeers that do not concern their own 

 immediate interests, most painful to persons jgifted with a love of method-like you and !me, for instance. No wonder we English are -alwavs -caught unprepared when we eo to Wfif^&nd get laughed at all over Europe tili we begin to fight, that is. The reaction 

 , sets-in men. 

 However, ' r&venons a nos moutons'-a strictly literally appropriate tag, inasmuch as this lodge in the. wilderness is surrounded by similar enormous estates-leasehold, not freehold, by the way-all devoted to the pro duction of the merino variety of the ovine family. Millions of them are bred in these great solitudes. In favourable years I gather that one is enabled to export about one-half to a fourth of their value, in the shape of wool. This brings a good price, is as ne gotiable as gold, and the fortunes of the returned colonistB that we used to see in London society, are thus compiled. Of course there are details, the which I am setting my mind to master. But they would hardly interest you. One trifling fact I may mention, lest you should imagine the process of fortune constructing too ridiculously easy. It is, that there has been next to no rain for more than a year ; strange, almost incredible as it may seem to you of the rainy isles.. In conse quence, the country looks like a desert, and tens of thousands of sheep are dying here, and for hundreds of miles in every direction. Occurrences of this kind, you will undrstand, delay indefinitely and perhaps wholly frus trate one's too obvious purpose of gathering a competency, and hurrying out of the country as fast as may be." 

 " ' All this is very well,' I hear you say; 'but what about the social system. Why doesn't he tell me about her ? For of course there is a woman somewhere within the orbit of his existence. Wonder what they're like out there. Must be some, I suppose.' 

 " With your usual acuteness, which I have rerely known at fault, unless in a plain un varnished robbery like the doing to death of the favourite (and very nearly the backers) in our fatal year, you have hit the gold. 

 " Well, somehow or other, there is a she. How strange it seems that one's life, whether 

 " Pone me pigris ubi nulla campo, 

 Arbor aestiva recrcatur aere," &c. 

 Or, in the midst of cities, or even in the comparatively assured and fortified privacy of a messroom, should never be wholly free from the invasion of womanhood ! A book, a photograph, a souvenir of the slightest kind, is sufficient to arouse the tempestuous motives of those who are doomed to be "the prey of the gods" in this peculiar fashion. How much more so the perfect human form, "ripe and real," when it comes before your eyes in all the unconscious temptation of virgin youth and beauty, scarce unfolded morning, noon, and night; add to this that I am at present habUans in sicco, and you will conclude with the swift logical subtlety so proverbially yours, that, as a latter-day hermit, I may compare favour able with St Anthony. 

 " Heaven knows, I did not rush into danger. Languid and prostrated as I was after the overthrow of all my worldly hopes; worn and despairing when the one devouring pas sionate love of my life had disappeared, and all was like the last scene of a tragedy, when nothing is left for the spectators but to wrap their cloaks around them and go home ; I deemed that I was coming to a land where there were no women, except black ones, ot those who chiefly were required for culinary 

 purposes. 

 " How little we know of these new lands, all English as they are, as if in the Midland Counties, yet with manner of strangely freBh and high development and new material! How I am Bhut up with a magnificent young creature, with a face like Egeria, and a figure like the huntress maid, burning with en thusiasm, talented, cnltured, full of all noble healthy feminine attributes ; dangerous with the fascination of fresh, iunocept woman hood, yet ignorant of the ways of the world, and childlike in her unsuspicious' confi 

 dence. 

 " I wiBh I was young again ; I do, really, Charlie. Could I but blot out the years that have intervened-not so many-but what dead sea fruit have I not tasted during their stormy course. What a burnt out volcano is this heart of mine. Could I but recall the past, and. be like one of our schoolboy 

 hetoea: 

 " The happy page who was the lord _ Of one soft heart and his own sword." 

 What empires and kingdoms would I glre supposing them to be mine to revtet to that position, and so prove myself worthy oE 

 the fresh Uenrt, the petals of which arc about to open before rue like a rose in June! That I shall be the favoured suitor, despite of the opposition of a good-looking, stalwart, provincial rival, my experience assures me. 

 With women I'tnconnu is always the interest ing, the romantic, the irresistible. In despite of myself, I see clearly my future position of ieun premier in this opera of the wilderness. It might be worse, yon will say. That I grant. But you know that Helen of Troy would never control this restless, wayward heart of mine in perpetuity. 

 " For the rest, the life is bearable enough free, untrammelled, novel, with a tinge of adventure. My days are spent in the saddle. There's just a hint of shooting, no hunting, no fishing. We dress for dinner, and live much as at a shooting lodge in the High lands, witli stockriders for gillies. So we are not altogether barbarous, as you aud others imagine. This letter is far too long, and im prudently confiding, so I hasten to subscribe myself, yours, a9 of old, 

 "BERTRAM DEVEREGX." 

 Thus much for (he impression Pollic was capable of producing on a worn, world-weary 

 heart. 

 It was a strange fate which had thus im prisoned this beautiful creature, so richly endowed with all the attributes which com bine to forui the restless, tameless, unsatis (ied man, amid surroundings so uninteresting and changeless. Eager for adventure, even for danger, she was curious with a child's hungering, insatiable appetite for the know ledge of wondrous lands, cities, peoples, hating the daily monotone to which the wom.m'a household duties are necessarily I attuned. Capable of the strongest, the 

 most passionate attachment, yet all ignorant j as yet of the subtle, sweet, o'er mastering tones-the world-conquering harmony of j love. In the position to which she appeared immovably attached by circumstance, she seemed like a stray, bright plumaged bird, a foreign captive, taken in infancy and reared in an alien land. 

 A chamois in a sheep fold, a leopardess in a drawing-room, a red deer in a trim and closely-paled enclosure, could uot have been more hopelessly at war with surroundings, more incongruously provided with food and shelter. Day after day a growing discontent, a hopeless despairof life, seemed to weigh her down to take the savour from existence, 

 to restrain the instinctive sportiveness of j youth, to hush the spirit song of praise with which, like the awakening bird, she should 

 have welcomed each dawning morn. | 

 " Why must it be thus?" she often a�ked j herself when restless at midnight, as at | 

 noonday she gazed out from her window across the far wide star-lit plain, wherein the melancholy swaying of pale-leaved trees seemed to be whispering secrets of past famine years, or sighing weirdly over sorrows 

 to come. 

 " Wilj it always be so ?' thought she, " and is my life to trickle slowly along like acourse of some enfeebled stream, until after long, melancholy assimilation to the mean mono tony of this desert dreariuess, I shall become like one of the house-mothers I Bee from time to time around me. Ignorant, in curious, small-sou led, with an intelligence gradually shrivelling up to the dimensions of a childhood with which they have nothing else in common. \\V hat a hateful prospect! what a death in life to look forward to! Were it not for my darling mother and the few friends I may call my own, I (eel as it I could put an er.d to an existence which has so little to recommend it-so pitiably small 

 an outlook." 

 In all this outburst of capricious discontent, the experienced reader oi the world's page will perceive nothing more than the instinc tive, unwarranted, impatience of youth-in man or woman-is utterly devoid of reason !>r gratitude. 

 What! does not the vast calm universe wait and watch each weak railer at destiny for the completion of ' nature's' wond'rous plan J and not the years, the Aeons, and the sands of the sea, that intervene between pro mise and fulfilment? Hast thou not en joyed ease, love, unwearyinganxioustendance for the da�n of thy helpless, as yet useless being': and while all creation puffers and travails, canst thou uot endure the unfolding of thy fatal lot 

 Applying possibly such remedies to her mental ailment, life appeared to go on much the same at Gorindah; much as it had done, Pollie thought, since the earliest days she could remember as a little girl. She could almost have supposed that the same things had been said by the same people, or people very like them, since her babyhood. Wonderings whether it would rain soon, by the mildly expectant; doubts whether it would ever rain n^ain, by the scofiers and unbelievers; assertions that the seasons bad changed, by the prophets of evil; superficial sanguine predictions that it would rain some day, by the light-minded; hopes and trust ing confidence in the Great Iiuler, that he would not suffer his people to be utterly cast down nor forsaken, that the dumb creatures of llis hand would have a bound set to their sufferings - all these had she heard and experienced from time to time ever since Bhe could recall herself as a conscious entity. Then, after a less or greater interval, the blessed rain of heaven would fall, plenteously, excessively, perhaps superfluously, without warning, without limit, and the long agony of the drought would be 

 over. 

 Something of this sort had Pollie been saying to her cousin, as they eat at breakfast one gusty, unsettled, red-cloudy morning. He had been inquiring satirically whether it ever rained at Corindah. "He had been here six months and had never seen any. Would all the sheep die ? Would all the watercourses dry up? Would they all be forced to abandon the Btation? And was this a sample of Australia and its vaunted bash 

 life?" 

 " Things are not quite so bad generally," laughed Pollie; "though I cannot deny that in these months, unless the weather changes, it will be what you men call a * blue look out* Poor mother is more anxious every week, and Mr. Gateward's face is getting more and more like that of a broiuse 

 idol" 

 "It does not seem like a laughing matter," Baid he gravely. " The loss of the labour of years, of a fortune, and then " Que Jx&nF 

 laughing in faith." retorted Pollie; so that really I am in a more religious fr^tneof mind than all the solemn-faced people :wbo despair of God's goodness. Of jexmrse, ip will rain sometime or other. It jtnidit ewnxaiii to;night, though it does not lQok'&be least like it Again, it might not rain

 "Truly astounding. I must take your worn literally, but really I should hardly believe any one else." . . , ., 

 " You may always believe me, the girl said proudly, as she stood up and faced hup, with raised head and erect form, her bright blue eves fixed steelfastly upon his, and almost emitting a Hash, it seemed to him, from tlieir steady glow. " Promise me that every word I say shall be accepted by you as the absolute, unalterable truth, or I will speak to you no more about my native land, or auything 

 " I promise," he said, taking her hand in his own and reverently bowing over it. And now I am going for a long ride, to the outer well. I must be off." 

 "To Durbah, 40 miles and more ? she said. "Why did von not make ail earlier start'! What are you going to ride ?" , 

 " Winglemon," ue said. He is a wonder ful goer, arid seems quieter than he was. n 

 " He is a treacherous, bad-tempered brute, 

 she returned answer, rather quietly, and nothing will ever make him quiet Besides, I think there's some kind of change coming cn. The wind has changed for the third time since sunrise, and the clouds are bank ing up fast to the west We might have a stonu." , T 

 " What fun," said the Englishman, I should like it of all things. The cliuiate here doesn't seem to have energy enough for a right-down good storm." 

 " Vou don't know what you are talking about," she said ; "you haven't seen a storm, or a Hood, or a bush fire, or anything. Take my advice and ride a steady horse to-day. Something tells me yon might want me. Promise me, will you ?" . 

 There was an unusual earnetness in the girl's voice as she spoke, and, placing her hand on his shoulder, she looked in iiis face. A low muttering roll of thunder seemed to accentuate her appeal. The young man smiled. as he answered, " My dearest Pollie, I should be Borry to refuse the slightest re quest so llatteringly in my interest I will seek me a charger practised in the manty? in place of the rather erratic ' Wingalmon.'" 

 In a few minutes more, as.ehe stood by the open window, she saw him ride through the outer gate on a dark bay horse, whose elastic stride and powerful frame showed him to be one of those rare combinations of strength, speed, and courage, of which the great Australian desert holds no inconsiderable number. ( 

 " Dear old Guardsman ! I'm so glad that he took him. I did'nt know he was in. I wonder what makes me so nervous and 

 apprehensive to-day. It surely cannot be going to rain, or is there au earthquake im minent ? I believe in presentiments, and if the day is like the others we have bad this year, I never shall do so again. - There goes another clap of thunder ?" 

 Thatmorning was spent by Pollie De vereux, it muBt Ik confessed, in a manner so aimless, so inconsistent with her mother's fixed prin ciples on the score of regular employment for young women, that it drew forth more than one mild reproach from that kindly 

 matron. 

 "My dear, I can't bear to see you going about from one room to the otherwithout settling to anything. Can you not sit down to your work, or practice, or go on with some historical reading, or your French, in which Bertram says you are making such progress? You're wasting your time sadly." 

 " Mother," said her daughter, facing round upon her with mock defiance, " could you sit down to your work if there was going to be a shipwreck, or a cyclone, or a great battle fought on the plain ? Though, really, you dear, good old mother, 1 think you would, and thread your needle till the Soundheads marched at the outer gate, as they did in ' The Lay of Britonmart,' or took down the sliprails, as it would be in oar case. But, do you know, there is an electrical current in the air, I am sure, and so I, being of a more excitable nature, do really feel so aroused and excited that I can't keep quiet Some thing is going to happen." 

 " Now, my dearest Pollie, are yon not let ting your imagination ran away with you? What can happen? There may be a little wind and rain. What the shepherds call 'a nice storm'-but nothing else 1 fear." 

 "Something wicked this way comes!" cbant&l Pollie, putting herself; into a dra matic attitude "See how dark it is grow ing. Look at the lightning. Oh, dear, what a Hash! And hear-down comes the rain at last-in earnest, too !" 

 " The rain will have to be very earnest, my dear," said Mrs. De vereux, "before poor Corindali feels the benefit of it-though that certainly is a heavy showed KarJy !n the season, too. This is only the 8th of Febru ary. There is the lunch belL Come along, my dear: A little lunch will do you good." 

 "How wet poor Bertram will be," said 

 Pollie, pityingly. He said we coitleTnl have 

 storms here."
