BLACK THURSDAY.\
IN FIVE CHAPTERS.\
CHAPTER IV.\
THE man turned upon him a visage that terrified him. It was, indeed, no longer a human visage ; but a scorched and swollen mass of deformity. The beard and hair were burnt away. Eyes were not visible ; the whole face being a confused heap of red flesh and hanging blisters. The poor fellow raised a pair of hands that displayed equally\
the dreadful work of the fire.\
The young squatter exclaimed. " How dreadful ! Let me help you, Fehan\'97let me take you home.\
The man groaned again ; and, opening his distorted mouth with great agony, said :\
" I have no home\'97it is burnt out." " And your family ? "\
" Dead\'97all dead !"\
" But are you sure\'97are you quite sure ? " said Robert, excitedly.\
" I saw one\'97my eldest boy : he was lying burnt near the house. I lifted him, to carry him away, but he said," Lay me down, father ; lay me down ; I cannot bear it." I laid him down and asked, Where are the rest ?" " They fled into the bush, and they are all burnt," he said, then he died."\
Robert Patterson flung the wretched man a linen handkerchief, bidding him dip it in the creek and lay it on his face to keep the air from it, and turned his horse, saying he would look for the family. He aoon found the place where the hut had stood. It was burnt to ashes. On the ground, not for from it, lay the body of the dead little boy. Patterson hastened along the track of the old road to the Maxwells' station, tracing it as well as he could in the fire and the fallen branches. He felt sure the escaping family would take that way. In a few minutes it brought him again upon the creek by which the poor man sat, but lower down.\
There stood a hut in a damp awamp, which had been used years ago for the sheep washing, but had long been deserted. It was surrounded by thick wattles, still burning. Tho hut was on fire ; but its rotten timbers forced out far more amoke than flame. As he approached, he heard low cries and lamentations. " The\
family has fled here," he said to himself, " and they are perishing of suffocation." He sprang to the ground, and dashed forward through columns of heavy smoke. It was hopeless to breathe in it, for its pungent and stinging strength seemed to close his lungs, and water rushed from his eyes in torrents.\
But pushing in, he seized the first living thing that he laid his hands on, and bore it away. It was a child. Again\
and again he made the desperate trip, and succeeded in bringing out no less than four children and the mother, who was sunk on the floor as if she was dead. However, she soon gave signs of life as she came into the air.\
The young man was now in the utmost most perplexity with his charge. It was a heart-rending sight. The whole group were more or less burnt; but, as it seemed to him, not so much burnt as to affect their lives. Their station was three miles distant, and he had no alternative but to leave them here till he rode on and sent a cart for them. With much labour, carrying the children one after another in his arms, he conveyed the woeful group to the father.\
As the young man stood bewildered by the cries and lamentations of the family on meeting the father, a horse ridden by a lady approached at a gallop. This apparition contrasted strangely witb the lamentable group of sufferers. The young lady was tall and had a most beautiful figure. She was mounted on a fine bay horse. A light skirt, and broad felt hat were all the deviations from her home costume that haste had led her to assume. Her face, fresh and roseate, full of youth, was at the same time grave and anxious, as she gazed in speechless wonder on the scene.\
\
"Miss Maxwell !" Patterson exclaimed, "in the name of Heaven, what news ? How are all at the Mount ? Yet, on this dreadful day what but ill can happen ?"\
" Nothing is amiss, that I know of," said the young lady," we are safe at\
home. The fire has not come near us."\
" Thank God !" said Robert. " I was going to your house, when I fell in with this unfortunate family. Will you ride back and send us a cart ?"\
\
" But I beg you will come with me, for I too, was going to you."\
" To me !" cried the young man, in the utmost astonishment. " Then all\
is not right. Is George well? "\
" I hope so," replied Miss Maxwell ; but the tears started into her eyes at the same moment and Robert Patterson gave a groan of apprehension.\
" I hope so," added the young lady, recovering her self-possession ; " but that is the point I want to ascertain. Yesterday, he went with Turcenn into the hills to bring in some cattle, and this morning the fire surprised them when they had taken two different sweeps along the side of a range. Turcen could not find George again, but made his way home, hoping his master had done the same. George has not yet returned, and the fire is raging so fiercely in the hills, that I could think of nothing but coming to you for your advice and asistance."\
" Thank you, Ellen ! " said Robert with a sad emotion. " I will find him if he be alive." He sprang upon his horse and telling the unhappy family that he would send them immediate assistance, both he and Miss Maxwell galloped away.\
We will not attempt to divulge their conversation on the way ; but will let the reader a little into the mutual relations between these two families\
and these young people. Miss Ellen Maxwell and her brother George were the sole remaining members of their family. As the nearest neighbours of the Pattersons, they had grown into intimate friends. George and Robert had been playfellows in Van Diemen's Land, and after they arrived here, they were fellows. Since then they had gradually grown through a similarity of tastes and modes of life, to be the most intimate friends. It was not likely that Robert Patterson and Ellen Maxwell conld avoid liking one another. They possessed everything in mind, person, and estate, which made such an attachment the most natural thing in tbe world. Ellen was extremely attached to Mrs. Patterson, for whom she had the highest regard. Ellen\
had received an excellent education in Edinburgh, whither she had been sent to her friends. In her nature she was\
frank, joyous, and affectionate; but not without a keen sense of womanly pride, which gave a certain dignity to her manner, and a reputation for high spirit.\
All had gone well between herself and Robert until some six months ago. Since then, a misunderstanding had sprung up between them. Nobody could tell how It had arisen ; nobody except Ellen knew and whatever was the secret was, she locked it within her. All at once she had assumed a distant and haughty manner towards Robert Patterson.\
From him she did not conceal that she felt she had cause for dissatisfaction, but she refused to explain. When, confounded by the circumstance, he sought for an explanation, she bade him search his\
own memory and his heart, and they would instruct him. She insisted\
that they should cease to regard themselves as affianced, and only consented that nothing as yet should be said on the subject to her brother or Mrs. Patterson, on the ground that it would most painfully afflict them.\
Ellen, who used to be continually riding over to see Mrs. Patterson with her brother, now rarely appeared, and proudly declined to give her reasons for this change in her, adding that she must absent herself altogether, if the subject were renewed. To her brother she was equally reserved, and he attributed her conduct to caprice ; bidding Bobert take no notice of it. Ellen was not without other admirers, but that was nothing new. One young man, who had lately come into the neighbourhood, paid her assiduous attention and gossip did not fail to\
attribute the cause of Robert Patterson's decline of favour to his influence. But Ellen gave no countenance to such a supposition. She was evidently under no desire to pique her old lover by any marked predilection for a new\
one. Her nature was too noble for\
the pettiness of coquetry, and any desire to add poignancy to coldness. On the other hand, it was clear to the quietly watchful eye of her brother, that she was herself even more unhappy than Robert. Her eyes often betrayed the effects of secret weeping, and the paleness of her cheek belied the\
assumed air of cheerfulness that she wore.\
Things were in this uncomfortable\
state at the outbreak of the fire. It\
was, therefore, a most cheering thought to Patterson that, in her distress, she had flown first, and at once to him. This demonstrated confidence in his friendship. True, on all occasions, she had protested that her sense of his high moral character was not an iota abated, but in this spontaneous act, Robert's heart persuaded him that there lay something more.\
\
No sooner did he reach the Mount,\
than, leaving Ellen to send off assistance to the Fehans, he took Turcen the stockman, and rode into the forest hills. It was soon dark, and they had to halt, but not far from the spot where Turcen had lost sight of his master. They tethered their horses in a space clear of trees and fire and gave them corn that they had brought with them. When the moon rose, they went on to some distance uttering loud cooees to attract the attention of the lost man, but all in vain. The fire had left the ground hot and covered with ashes, and here and there huge trees were still burning like columns of\
red-hot iron.\
Finding all their efforts for the night fruitless, they flung themselves down beside their horses and, with the earliest peep of dawn they were up and off higher into the hills. Their way presented at every step the most shocking effects of the fire. Ever and anon they came upon bullocks which had perished in it. Here and there, too, they found the remains of kangaroos, opossums, and hundreds of birds, seared and shrivelled into sable masses of cinder.\
