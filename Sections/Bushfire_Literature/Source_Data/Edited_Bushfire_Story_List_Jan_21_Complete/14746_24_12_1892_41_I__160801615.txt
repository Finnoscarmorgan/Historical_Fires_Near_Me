 AN EPISODE IN THE CAREER 

 OF BILLY MARTIN. 

 by Faddy Melon. 

 About2 o'clock in the afternoon of December 24,18G0odd,MountHopeful was grilling beneath the rays of tbe fierce early summer sun. The sinuous strip of highway which wreathed about the hollow, and disappeared with a final kink over the hill, was brilliant and palpitating with the mirage, and the grilling process aforesaid was pleasantly and appropriately accompanied by the stunning and oeaselesB clamour of cioadas�"locusis," the Mount Hopeful folks called them. Save for the efforts of these salamandrine performers sounds there were none. The wattle birds and black magpies finding it too hot even for thieving, had ceased from their depredations on the early fruit, and disappeared beneath tbe meagre shade of the gumB, there to. listlessly strop their beaks in silence, and patiently await a cool change Bill Sampson's old white mare having chanced upon a patch of Bhade in the creek under, the weeping willow was making the moBt of it as she stood with bushy fetlocks immersed in the lazy, lukewarm stream, and ever and anon swept away the gathering flies from her broad back with a deliberate lateral swing of tho ample tail. Beneath tbe verandah of the store spread flaccidly out, and so flat that he looked like tbe half-model of a dog, lay the canine outcast, Bawley. Also beneath 

 tbe verandah, and perched upon the window 

 sill above him, listlessly swaying his dusty bare feet, waBthe other village outcast, yclept Billy Martin. And these two and old Jess soaking her ample hoofs under the willow were, oicoept the flies, the only living creatures visible on 

 that afternoon. 

 Billy yawned and wriggled, and looking at Bawley, gave an impatient sigh. Bawley, with a reproachful backward glance at the bunch of flies which had found a bald and vulnerable spot upon his shaggy back, sighed sympatheti cally, and with a spasmodic kiok spread himself ont flatter than ever. Indeed, it was hot, and there were no birds to " heave" at, and no cats to attend to, and so Billy sighed 

 again. 

 " Blow this 'ere." said Billy vindictively, as he gazed about him in the vague hope of realizing some animate object that might be done to death with road metal as a safety valve for his dissatisfaction. "Call this ere Christmas Heve,"with scornful venom, "it's worso'n a wet Saturd'y. Blest if I'm agoing to wait for Tommy Thorpe no longer. 'Speot his ole woman's bowled him out an' give 'im a lammin'. Oh ! haw, haw. Never mind, ole Bawley '11 come, I bet. Come on, ole man ; sh ! possums!" and Billy dropped upon his bare feet with a sudden alertness artfully de signed to arouBe the dormant passion for the chase which slumbered within the 

 chase which slumbered within the bosom of the recumbent Bawley. 

 Ketch 'em, boy. Possums, Bawley; and Billy Enatched up a stone, and poised it with fine dramatic effect. Bawley hauled in his palpitating red tongue, and flogged the ground with the end of bis tail in acknowledgement 

 of tbe pointed invitation, but declined it with a significant silence there was no misunder standing. _ . 

 *' Well tha's pretty straight, anyhow. jLiook 'ere," said Billy in anguish of spirit, nddreBsing an imaginary audience, and pointing to the guilty Bawley, who seemed to feel the enormity of his conduct, and swallowed his emotion in several gulps, as if it were a large but soft morsel, while he gazed in a propitiatory manner at his accuser, " this 'ere dog a lay in*' 'ere; this 'ere Bawley, as a man might eay, never 'ad nocollar. No 'edidn't, 'strue's you're there; consequence was he never had no | standin' like, didn't carry no weight, so 

 to speak, 'cept a hodd kar'sine tin, which dtra'fc count. Whever he 'tended ameetin' ef he didn't vote just the pop'lar way the other dogs took'n 'tended to his case just, like, cause why; while he was worryin' at a mouthful of leather and brass, the other feller 'd be chewin' the scrag end of his neck out on account of him 'avin' no collar on. Well, one hex'lent young gen'lm'n in this here jolly township seen this chap's trouble, 'n what did he do'! Did he bust 'im with a panel-rail ? No, he didn't. Did he send his best respex from the front end of a gun, all 'dulterated with rosella shot ? Cert'nly not. What he done was to wait till he seen a drover's dog comin' along with a six-hob collar on, 'n by the time the dog had persuaded him to purchase the collar the drover was so fur ahead he couldn't catch up to him with the six bob. There you are, leather collar with thick brass nameplate equal to any collar in the hills. But it's all right 'miff, o'ny, next time Dame Sampson takes 'n ties a kar'sine tin to your tail you just wear it for my sake. I'm off to Muggs's pad dick," and the injured Billy giving his pants an indignant but necessary hitch to retain them in position, started in defiant solitariness for " Muggs's paddock." 

 Billy Martin was the bad boy of the village. To this regrettable position he bad been elected by the voice of his townspeople, more espeei townswomen. It is needless to add, that as a necessary consequence of his evil reputation and airy indifference to the little amenities of civilization the other boys grappled him to their souls with hooks of steel, with one un worthy exception. This was Willy Barker, who was the good boy of the village, and whose reputation was established in inverse ratio to Billy's; but I need hardly have done more than mention the significant abbrevia tion of their Christian names to "Billy" and " Willy" respectively, to demonstrate the faot. Billy's instincts were philosophical, and while he accepted the adulation of his admirers with a gracious content he entirely ignored the dis favour of Willy Barker, as lie could, and did, "lick him left hand." Willy Barker was possessed of unnatural and loathly characte ristics. He told the truth on occasions when a lie would have been equally servicable he could also do crochet-work. He had been known to surrender without 

 giving battle on the first appeal from bis father to get his hair cut. His clothing was offensively whole and insultingly prolific in the matter of buttons, and bis face was clean as often as not. In fact it was on evidence that he had been known to voluntarily wash it�in cold water. I was about to say in cold blood; " I seen him do it, dash mo if I didn't," said the scandalized Billy Martin. " Never made no more of it, he didn't, than I would 'a knock in' a silver-eye;" adding explanatorily, "Tha's wot I punched 'is ed for." White Willy's father was a well-to-do gardener, and also an audible and energetic labourer in the spiritual vineyard for the "Primitives," Billy Martin's parentage was an impregnable conundrum, as his alleged protector and possible relative, old Daddy Spence, repelled all enquiries concerning the boy's history with such a nervous nnd unbounded discharge of blasphemy that the questioner usually retired in a kind of stunned awe such as is induced by a sudden and unexpected clap of thunder. 

 Nine years or so previous to the date of my story Daddy Spence had absented himself from Monnt Hopeful for three days, having achieved the miraculous feat of allowing himself; 

 to lapse into a condition of apparent sobriety for his departure. When he returned he was accompanied by Billy Martin; then about four years old. The old gentleman had apparently, during his absence, repented of his unnatural abstention from b :er, and practically expressed his contrition by returning beneath the spell of a drunk of such finished and stately pro 

 Jiortions that the villagers, who had known 

 lim long, afterwards looked baet upon it as 

 his masterpiece. When Daddy Spence had ebbed to. his usual level of intelligible inebriety he concisely stated that he had adopted the boy, adding with a humour that was recognised as original that he had constituted the lad "hie heir." and winding up with a bran new, if gratuitous, oath, which was slightly 

 from that day unt 

 Billy Martin had ; - ,, 

 dom, enjoying'such educational advantages as usually fall to the lot of a dog which is not 

 destined for a useful career. 

 Billy made his way into the scrub which surrounds or did then surround Mount Hopeful, encountering many wire-fences which ^ he, as a matter of course, climbed over; boys, if rightly constructed, considering it a blot upon their escutcheons to crawl through anything lofty enough to be surmounted. Finally, after journeying some two miles over hill and gully he reached a secluded spot in a blind creek, which was more than usually heavily timbered and overgrown with dense scrub and under growth of every local description. This wa? evidently his destination, for diving through a tangled ridge of native lilac and other oreepers he emerged in a small open spaoe which sur rounded the gaunt and towering form of an old dead gum, and without pausing disap peared into a small opening in the bleached trunk, which showed at the ground level. 

 The cavity into which Billy had made his way opened out into a tolerably spacious chamber, eaten out of the mossy trunk by the combined effects of water and fire, as the rains of winter in the oourse of long years had rotted the stout heart of the big redgnm, and some former bush fire had attacked and con sumed the injured portion of the wood. The entranoe, as I have Baid, was small, but euffioiently large to grant easy ingress to Billy's slender frame, and the amoun.t of light admitted allowed of but an imperfect inspection of the interior, but to the boy's notion of his require 

 ments he had attained to a measure of success such as be had thought nothing of a lower grade than an angel could encompass. 

 For Billy and hiB tried comrade Tommy Thorpe were noted bushrangers�theoreti cally�aDd had leng been scouring the neigh bourhood for a suitably concealed stronghold� �� lair," Tommy Thorpo said. They would etore therein the imaginary valuables they were in the habit of wresting under circum stances of cold-blooded ferocity from their unsubstantial victims. Tommy, by virtue of superior literary attainments, had been enabled to crowd so many thrilling incidents into the experience of " the hand" of two that 

 lie had been unanimously elected to tne 

 leadership, and the fascinatingly ruthless outlaw chief was supposed to wallow in splendid atrooities under the appropriate appellation of " Captain Gore." Billy, whose life Captain Gore had " saved at the imminent hazard of his own" under ciroum etances which necessitated the slaughter of a whole grass-tree community, carried out the duties of second in command with considerable zeal and ability, somewhat marred, however, by his frequent lapses into the matter-of-faot mode of expression common to every-day life, a proceeding whiob invariably roused the in dignation of Captain Gore. I should state that in his professional capacity of freebooter Billy was known to fame as " Flint Heart." 

 When Flint Heart had subsided into 

 sufficiently unnatural position to satisfy a boy's idea of Teposeful ease he hauled forth from some portion of the "looped and win dowed raggedness" wherein he was enmeshed a clay pipe of so aged and dissipated an aspect as to suggest to his acquaintances that it had gradually acquired a general resemblance to its former proprietor, Daddy Spence, from whom the dashing outlaw had ''shook it," to use his own wild and beautiful imagery. The bush ranger next produced a match, which was adioitly scratched upon the sombre bowl o the treasured pipe, and pretty soon the hollow trunk was charged with a cloud of smoke of a density and savour that would have stiSed any less susceptible creature than a boy, as Flint Heart found it necessary to eke out his slender store of the legitimate weed by the addition of equal parts of " honeysuckle" and tealeaves. Billy didn't soliloquize, because to do so is an unnatural proceeding only indulged in by the boy of the novelist's fancy, but his thoughts 

 ran as follows :� 

 " This'll suit Captain Gore all to pieces. My word, ef he asked me ef I kaowed a lair when Iseeone. Do I? Oh, no; certainlynot. Notby no means. Why, I lay there ain't a lair in the hills can get within cooee of her. She's a eumtyis old lair; jiggered ef she ain't. Captain GorB couldn't turn out a lair like her ef you was to bile him. I own Captain Gore is a good bushranger. I never see such a chap for des troyin' gum saplin' wimin n' children in cold blood, 'n earryin' off grass-tree captives f'r rannom, but he don't give me no credit f'r knowin' nothing. Let him put this 'ere lair in his pipe 'n smoke it. This 'ere lump of punk what I knocked off of the big limb '11 make a beautiful scull f'r Captain Gore to pint ab when he tells the captives to tremble 'n ses he's a deeprit man, 'n I'll shake some Bpuds 'n apples out of old Stapler's garden, 'n we'll make a fire 'n have a banquet like what Tom�Captain Gore reads about. I hope his old womau don't belt him 'n send him to bed so's wo can't rob no travellers." 

 Flint Heart's thoughts ran on in a more and more disconnected manner for seme little time longer, as the beat, the profound stillness (save for the whirring jar of cicades, which music no more affected the tired outlaw than does the hum of the machinery disturb the miller), and the soothing mixturo which h6 had been smoking disposed his soul to slumber, until finally the shock bead sank upon the out stretched arm, and so we leave 50 per cent, of the band of bloodthirsty ruffians to a dream less repose.
