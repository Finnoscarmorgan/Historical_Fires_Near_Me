 THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE. 

 BY LTTKE SMYLEY. 

 THE Cozys are"recovering from their late attack of madness. It is well k n o w n that certain forms of insanity at times attack fanulies and whole communities, and tliat the disease is in some respects as contagious as small-pox or scarlet fever. The old proverb puts it :� � One fool makes many." If it were, " One lunatic makes many, the statement could be proved like a proposition in Euclid. Mrs. Cozy went mad first, and poor Cozy caught it from her. lie never really was as mad asshe. The disease showed itself in him by an imitation of her madness, and by an insane agreement iu her wildest and most fantastic fancies. This is a clear case of contagious lunacy. If Mrs. Cozy had not gone mad first Cozy would have retained his senses during his lifetime. He actually attempted to struggle for a time for the possession of his reason, and even went so far as to try and argue his afflicted wife out of her 'delusions. But when lie saw it was useless, and that Mrs. Cozy was resolved upon going off her chump, he made up his mind that she should not go alone, and that he would go with her. And so he also went mad. As a history of this case may serve as a caution toother quite middle-aged people against letting their imagination overpower their reason we give it, and we beg our readers to remember that the story is true. 

 The Cozys lived in a thoroughly comfortable cottage of their own in one of the pleasantest of our up-country towns. Their lofty rooms were handsomely furnished, and they had everything in their possession that could minister to their comfort or happiness. There are few pleasanter houses in Victoria than theirs�few from which a man would be so loth to tear himself or so happy to return to. They had pleasant society, pretty surroundings ; all that man or woman could long for in a home. One would as soon have expected Adam and Eve to have left Eden of their own accord to go and ramble in the Arabian desert as the Cozys to have given up their lovely cottage for the miseries of hotel life on a holiday tour. They did this because they were mad. When Mrs. Cozy proposed a holiday tour her husband thought she was joking. But she was not, poor creature�she was only 

 "^i want a thorough change," she said, "to get away hundreds of miles from here and see new faces and things." He suggested that they should pack up a lot of trunks and bandboxes, wait for a very hot or a very cold day, and then start at early morn for some place about two hundred miles away, where they could meet a return train that would take them back by midnight. , "Thus, my dear," he put it, "you would obtain all you seek for. You would have a thorough change from the daily comfort of your life to the misery of travel. You would see strange faces at every station, and if you wanted to prolong the agony, instead of returning to our own home we could go to one of the hotels in the town. Believe me, that they are as uncomfortable as any you would meet on a holiday trip." But when she wept, and called herself an injured woman and said thatother husbands were not as unkind to their wives, he yielded, and 

 consented to the tour." Under the most favourable circumstances a journey of 380 miles by rail, coach and boat, with about a dozen changes of luggage and two nights' stoppages on the road, is not a jolly affair. But the Cozys did not travel under favourable circumstances. The first and second day's journey by coach and rail wa; in weather with the thermometer up to 110� in the shade, the dust flying in clouds, and the air blinding with the smoke of bush fires. On the third day, iu travelling by boat over our beautiful lakes, the rain fell in torrents and thoroughly soaked the clothes and luggage of the pleasure seekers. We should like to hear the Young Men's Christian Association debating which of the three following modes of travel are most objectionable :� 1st. Cobb's coaches on dusty roads in blazing weather, and with mixed passenger list of Chinamen, unsavoury farmers, and mothers with squalling children. 2nd. Victorian railway compartment, same weather, five passengers on a side whose knees touch, windows either shut with suffocation or open with dust, smoke and ashes from the engine; male passengers all growling because female objects to smoking, 

 3rd Lake boat in torrents of rain, never ceasing from 1 to 8 u in closely crowded with damp passengers smoking bad tobacco. The Cozvs by a thousand innocent artifices, endeavoured to make each other believe that they were heartily enjoying themselves. Especially Mrs. Cozy�it was part pflier^dkease. Once, w h e n two Chinamen got out of the cpadi, she said "How very nice, darling^I CML%ute, mbvemy ^ To which he, with the same almost immoral affectation of enjoyment, replied� "Very jolly, my dear. How miserable it would be tosit in an easv-chair in our cool verandah and drink iced soda-water." M the hotels they stayed at they had to put up with close, stuffy, foul-smelling bedrooms, greasy cooking, bad waiting, and a hundred nameless discomforts. But with the cunning of insanity, the poor demented creatures invented virtues where a sane person would only have seen utter misery, -.i " Onlv fancy, dear! They actually have a bath in the house with hot and cold water taps. It's lovely to think of in this sweltering W C " Delicious, my love," he answers, "if there was any water in the taps we might almost fancy we were at home." c, , , " What a very nice friendly girl that waitress is, Tom. She looks an excellent servant." ,, , " And I have no doubt she would be, my dear, if she could only be induced to wait on one." ,���,, And so on with everything. In the damp lake boat there was a eush over "such a comfortable little corner where hardly any ram can come in " There is the pleasing excitement caused by news that Uiat " there meie is auuuoiij actually half a.tvii an Argus ^ .. onboard," ~ 7 ' . tempered, however, i . ,, by the discovery that it is illegible through having been read m the engine-room. Then it is found that " it is so mee to stand by the funnel You can actually warm and dry yourself at it. livery small mercy is " so nice"�every escape from utter misery is regarded as something to be thoroughly happy at-every blow is softened�every slight alleviation of wretchedness turned into cause 

 for congratulation. , ft iBut it was all make-believe. In their heart of hearts the unhappy wanderers knew how miserable they were. Each knew that the other knew, and each knew that the other knew ,that he or she knew it Their protestations of " niceness" and "jollmess were, therefore, forced and unnatural. They didn't impose on themselves -they didn't impose on each other. They were hollow mockeries It was raining heavily when they reached the end of their 380 miles journey. It continued raining heavily for the three following davs "Glorious weather, this, for the country," everybody said. It may have been, but it was not glorious weather for the Cozys. Three days of constant rain in a place where you know no one, and are thrown completely on the companionsliip of your wife, arc enough to make a man home-sick. Neither of the Cozys can tell exactly which of them it was that first recovered sanity. But on the morning of the fourth day it was still raining heavily, and looking as 

 if it were good for another week. - - , A � "The boat leaves in lialf-an-hour," a fellow-victim remarked in their hearing. It was the spark applied to the fire-tlie light that enabled them to read their own thoughts. They retired to then- own room and embraced tenderly. . � , , � Jt will be so nice to get home again, she wept. " Awfully iolly," he cheerfully assented. This time they meant it. There was no make-believe now. Thev were both deadly serious. In fifteen minutes they had packed �in five minutes more settled up�in ten minutes on board the k�"01i Tom " she whispered, as on her husband's arm she leaned, and round her waist she felt it fold, " whatever on earth would we have done if we missed this boat ? Another day would have killed me. Never, never, let us leave home again when we once get there!" , ,, The Cozys, we are happy to say, have now quite recovered tlic possession of their senses.
