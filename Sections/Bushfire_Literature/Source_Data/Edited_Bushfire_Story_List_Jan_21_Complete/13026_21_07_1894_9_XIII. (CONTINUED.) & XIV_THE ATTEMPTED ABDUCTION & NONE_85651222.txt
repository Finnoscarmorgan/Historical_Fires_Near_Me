 CHAPTER XIII. (CONTINUED.) 

 Good bye, Jim,' Miss Murphy said. 'Take care of the master while I am away ' Good bye, Miss,' Jim answered. ' I'll keep everything right, and hope you'll be safe; but I don't like your going alone all the way. Once more giving ' Bushy' a finishing touch on the nose, he waited to receive the last instructions. 

 'Now, Jim,' Murphy said, 'don't let any one behind the bar, and keep your mouth shut, and don't go away from the place. We will go by Alec, the fencer's track, so you . My word, the old horse is fresh to-day ; you haven't been filling him with corn ? because, I don't want to have any more trouble with him, same as once before.' ' He's only had what he gets every day,' Jim answered, and then standing he looked from master to the horse. 'But my word,' he said, 'he's spry to-day, and looks a reg'lar picter.' The horses cantered away, and Jim, with his hands in his pockets, watched them from the verandah, as Murphy never but once be- 

 fore left him in charge, but now his strongest interest was with the horse and rider, and he mentally exclaimed: 'They do look a picter, my word. ' Murphy and his daughter soon passed through the township, and struck into the road leading to the fencer's selection. It was not often that Murphy could spare time to leave his business for the saddle, even when his daughter remained at home ; there- fore it was not surprising that Jim should think it must be something of importance, more than a fencing job, that would take him away. Arriving at another road, leading to Gis- bourne, Murphy rode with his daughter a mile further along the road, and then he thought she would be able to continue alone, without fear of interception. He had been absent an hour, and was anxious to return homewards. Giving his daughter instruc- tions to be careful, and saying good-bye,' they parted. "Well I can't make it out,' Murphy said to himself, 'I feel to-day, fidgety like, as though all was not right. But there, I sup- pose it's Flora's going, that's upset me a bit;' 'taking a flask from his pocket he placed it to Slo I([cwl u , , his lips, saying with a sigh; 'Ah! that will throw off the blues.' Turning the horse's head, he was presently trotting along the selector's road. Miss Murphy went her way, upon the main 

 road walking the horse, sometimes stopping and listening to the notes of the bell bird, and wishing that Bascombe would soon overtake her. Still riding, buried in thought and heed- less of time or place, she at length took out her watch, recollecting that she could not loiter longer and started into a short canter ; after passing a patch of bad road, she became aware that a horseman was approaching, riding fast from an opposite direction to her route. Before she had time to think of her position, the bushranger, Tom War- ren, rode his horse to her side. He raised his bat, in true Parisian fashion as he desired to appear in his best style, especially now, with such an opportunity. ' What a delightful meeting,' he said, I am pleased to see you, Miss. Flora.' ' Mr. Warren,' she replied ; ' you may think it peculiar, but I hoped to meet my friends without seeing anyone else.' ' That is strange,' he said ; ' I should have thought you would rather have met people.' 'Perhaps it might have been better,' she said. 'Flora, you know how often I have tried to say a word to you,' he said. 'Your in- fluence has made me so different. I have expelled from my mind all further communi- cation with my former acquaintances, and fully intend that the future shall be devoid of evil doings. I was never very bad; and, Flora, the whole aim of my life will be to gain your confidence, and by my conduct I hope in time to conquer all your prejudices. Do you know, Flora, I was arrogant enough to presume that I hold a place in your es- teem, more than mere friendship ; and that you would some day be my wife ' ''That is quite sufficient, Mr. Warren,' she replied, in an angry tone. 'Good morning.' As her light riding whip touched the horse, Warren caught the bridle reins. 'Flora,' he said.' Wait a little while. I do love you so much; all I have shall be yours ; I am sure your father will favor me; I am not a poor man, Flora ; I can command thousands� don't pull away� but allow me 

 to explain those false charges, against me that have made me unwelcome to you.' 'Let my horse go,' Flora said. 'How dare you insult me ?' She was greatly excited, urging her horse forward, and trying to loose the reins from Warren's hand. A fresh idea possessed Warren, and with a sudden impulse he seized Miss Murphy round the waist. 'I'll take you where we can talk, when you are in a better humour. I can't wait,' he said. 'Desist immediately,' she called out, striking him in the face, and struggling to release herself. Raising her off the saddle with his power- ful arm, he placed her in front of himself, retaining hold of her horse's reins. Flora fainted which facilitated the scheme of carrying her to a place a few miles distant, belonging to a cockatoo settler, once a mate of Warren's. He rode hard, often brushing the trees when turning angles, in the narrow road, where he had to exert the greatest skill to prevent the branches tearing his precious bur- den from his arms. Continuing at a maddening rate, down a gully, the horses took a flying leap across a chasm, then up the opposite rise then along 

 a flat piece of road, and around another sharp turn, with trees growing so close to- gether that they prevented him seeing an advancing horseman; riding almost as fast as himself . 'Save me! save me!' Miss Murphy screamed. The single horseman pulled up within a few strides after passing, and rode after the bushranger. 'Stop, for your life! ' he called; 'or I'll fire.' 'Never,' Warren answered. ' Fire if you dare.' Holding the girl between them. A little puff of smoke, from a revolver, and Horace Bascombe was riding beside Warren, and with the dexterity, only known to the back country rider, snatched Flora from the other's grasp, without resistance. Warren's spirit had fled. He had finished his last ride ; and his life in this world was ended. Bascombe held Flora firmly and rode after the affrightened horses, with the body of Warren swaying to the motion of the ghastly gallop. Bascombe's horse being comparatively fresh, in a few strides caught up to them. Catching the bridles of the horses, he quickly brought them to a standstill. Miss Murphy had somewhat recovered and was gently set down upon her feet ; Bascombe gathered an armful of ferns, from the adja- cent bush, and formed an accommodating cushion for her to rest upon. Buckling the bridles to a forked tree he went to examine the lifeless body of Tom Warren. He perceived the shot had entered the back of his head, killing him instantly. 

 'It's all over now,' he said. 'Poor War- ren, I remember we were friends, before his unfortunate preference became manifest. He was a man with many of the acquire- ments of a gentleman, but lost to all honor ; he had a fearless heart, but was a moral coward ; indeed, a curious anomaly.' The next proceeding on Bascombe's part, was to take the body off the track, and place it under a geebung bush, covering it with the broad leaves of the cabbage tree that he gathered. When this preliminary work was finished he returned and sat beside Miss Murphy. ' Flora,' he said, ; how did all this happen ?' I was perhaps too hasty, it is an awful act. ' 'I was going to Gisbourne,' Flora an- swered; 'as previously arranged, when Warren met me near the Green Swamp; after talking a great deal of nonsense he suddenly snatched me from my horse. The rest I cannot remember, until I saw you rush past, and you know the remainder.' 'We must not dwell longer on this sad scene,' Bascombe said. 'It's comparatively early; an hours' fast ride, and we shall be at Gisbourne; we had better start, if you feel strong enough to endure the fatigue of a gallop.' 'I am perfectly rested, thanks,' she said ; ' the shock caused me to be rather faint.' 'I dare say it did,' Bascombe answered; 

 ' you will be better away from here.' Walking to the horses they mounted, and after a fast ride, arrived at their friend's station. The police were informed of the details of the meeting, and Warren's untimely end. An investigation was held at an hotel, both witnesses being present, which terminated in a verdict of 'justifiable homicide,' as War- ren was gazetted an outlaw. Bascombe in due course was notified that he was entitled to the hundred pounds re- ward, which he declined. ����� 

 CHAPTER XIV. Curlew, with the two other bushrangers, returned by a circuitous route to their cave in the mountains, sadly depressed in spirits, knowing that their position was more pre- carious than previously. In all probability the troopers would sooner or later discover their retreat. 

 Lighting a fire, the billy was watched by one of them, while the others were in search of a fat wallaby, to satisfy them for supper. The sun had sunk, when the hunters re- turned, with a supply of game, which was immediately dressed for the cuisine. 'We must look for some bread,' Curlew said, ' have you made a search ?' 'There is flour, for a few days,' Ben re- plied ; ' as to tea and sugar, we have enough.' The men enjoyed the supper, not having eaten anything all day. ' My word,' Huntington said, ' this has been a fearful day for us. I wonder where Douglass and Warren have gone' 'I fancy they have cleared for Melbourne' Curlew said ; ' they are well known on this road, and a large reward is out for them, and their friends cannot be trusted.' 

 ' I guess it will be risky for us after this,' Ben said. ' We can't remain here always, that's cer- tain,' Huntingdon said. ' The Sydney side will be my dart.' The night passed without incident, and the following morning Curlew saddled his horse, to proceed to the Hanging Rock. Bora Bora was not there, but Eowani said that he would shortly return. Curlew re- mained chatting with the lubra, who had not forgotten her intention of speedily re- joining her tribe. ' Ball me like um camp', she said ; ' ball me yabba long warringo, plenty big moon.' ' You soon yan away ?' Curlew said, ' by um by.' 'Plenty yan up hill 'bout 'ere,' she said. ' Ball me yarraman.' They were talking long enough to allow Curlew to have several smokes ; when, with- out the slightest disturbance of the shrubbery fronting the cave, or the slightest sound, Bora Bora appeared before them. 'Me plenty patter, Master Rudolph,' he said ; ' you yan 'long me ?' ' What do you mean, Bora Bora,' Curlew said ; ' you found money ?' 'Ouay! Mastor Rudolph,' he said, 'me track 'em whitefeller when you bin long way.' 'I thought you would,' Curlew said. ' To-morrow you show me long away track.' Bora -Bora told all he knew about the troopers, and the fight behind the boulder rocks ; also, that he saw Curlew, and which was more interesting to Curlew, that Doug- lass and Warren had gone towards Gis- bourne. Curlew listened, to all the black said and did. Then saying that he would be with them to-morrow, he rode away in the direc- tion of his own quarters. Ben and his mate had made things comfort- able; the cave was swept clean, and an in- viting evening meal prepared. A cheerful feeling banished that of depres- sion. 

 Curlew told them that which he had heard of Douglass and Warren, and said he might have more news to-morrow. The next day he visited the blacks. Bora Bora said he was ready to guide him along the track, which led to where the booty would be found. Tho horse was tethered to a sapling, and he directed the lubra to watch him carefully. 'Come along,' Curlew said, 'lead the way.' They went through the bush, separating the bushes with their arms, as they pushed through the spreading branches. A good thing for Curlew that he was an excellent bush- man, and a good runner, for the blackfellow kept at a running pace, over hill and through scrub ; nothing was an obstacle to him. At length they found themselves overlooking a high perpendicular ravine. Bora Bora pointing to a round spur of the range, said that was the place. Walking along to the top of the rocks, they found an opening, and jumping from ledge to ledge, with the assistance of the trees, both reached the bottom. Crossing this the blackfellow quickly gained the top of the grassy ridge where blue stone boulders lay scattered about, as though shaken from a huge pepperbox, some being nearly hidden in the long wiry grass. 

 Squatting in the inviting herbage, Bora Bora motioned Curlew to do the same. ' Blackfellow big fellar yan,' he said ' 'fore me find um boot track ; plenty day go long gully, ball me find um boot track ; all track go bung, till one day go long this track, me find where yarram bin standing! plenty whitefeller tracks all 'bout ; me follow 'em up gully, and long a ridge 'ere ; follow 'em long a bit, what you call 'em� boulda, then can see plenty boots, same like 'em money. � Come now, Master Rudolph.' Jumping up, and starting at a slow run down the ridge, with Curlew following, often stepping onto fallen trunks of trees, then off again into holes, hidden by the thickly growing oaten-eared grass, made by the stumps being burnt out during bush fires ; at other times catching his legs in the vines trailing along the ground, till at last he per- ceived the blackfellow standing under a group of trees. Quietly going to him, he was shown impressions upon the ground, which the blackfellow said were horses hoofs, but too indistinct for Curlew to distinguish as such. ' Ball yer no see 'em,' Bora Bora remarked, 'Blackfellow make 'em out plenty, it see yarraman, look 'ere, long fellow bit of bark, off um tail.' And he held up a long horse-hair, that he had found. 'I think you are right,' Curlew said. 'Now let me see where the money is.' 'All right, Master Rudolph,' he said ; 'yan long up on ridge, me see 'em track, all way up, me show 'em you plenty.' The blackfellow again taking the lead went slowly, his face close to the ground, appearing at times undecided as if having 

 lost the track, but the hesitation did not continue long, for he followed such marks as he could see, often pointing out to Curlow the tracks as he said, of two whitefellows. The aboriginal has peculiar eyesight. A good tracker will follow traces, and see foot- prints when others could not perceive, the slightest mark, either of indentation or of disturbed twig or stone. Stopping before an ordinary boulder, near an old fallen stringy bark tree, Bora Bora motioned with his waddy,� meaning it was the hiding place ; but again Curlew did not remark any peculiarity to denote a differ- ence. ' Go on,' he said ; ' where's the plant. 'All right,' he said, ' 'yer look me pull 'em saplin's.' And he commenced clearing away the dead branches. Having removed these he rolled the boulder away� and, there lay exposed a hole full of gold and silver coins; Curlew was more than amazed, and uncon- sciously looked about to see if he were per- ceived. Then kneeling, he began counting the coins. When all of them were taken out, another surprise met his gaze ; under the money were discovered seven chamois bags containing gold ; these he estimated did not weigh less than five pounds each. Curlew deliberated a few minutes, consid- ering which would be the best plan to remove the rich plant. He was not a man to waste time, finding the legal owner. Years before when upon the dark green and ever blue waters of the roaring ocean, he had been taught, ' Every man for himself,' and this was not the first opportunity of carrying his early precepts into practice. 'You make um grass nose bags,' he said, budgery bag, no piccaniny holes, carry booty long a gunyah.' Bora Bora moved away to pull some stringy bark from the trunks, and sat down, busy in plaiting the flexible material into shape ; he completed throe ordinary bags, or hand baskets, largo enough to carry nearly all the gold and money. Curlew placed the bags of gold in the bas- kets and the money that could not be packed into the bags he distributed in his pockets. The black rolled the stone over the hole and proceeded towards the high rocks, the top of which after some difficult climbing 

 was again reached ; they then continued walking a few miles until Curlew noticed an admirable landmark, and a suitable place to deposit the valuable treasures, not far from the blacks' camp. This being done, in half an hour they were at the cave. They were away nearly all day, walking continually, each having a good appetite. Eowani placed a portion of a wallaby upon the ashes of the fire, with skin and hair on. It was not long cooking, but sufficiently so for a famished blackfellow, that is, just warmed through ; and Bora Bora was in the act of chopping a piece off with his tomahawk, when Curlew prevented him. Though hungry as possible, and not over fastidious, he could not eat as a blackfellow. (TO BE CONTINUED.)
