 THE RISE 

 AUSTRALIAN WOOL KINGS. 

 A ROMANCE OF PORT PHILIP. 

 [By James Mouat.] 

 CHAPTER XII. 

 in the rising young settlement there hrul ..been nothing so exciting as the exodus from j tlie old district as it went on to tlie new. The j road which led originally from the const, ; across the Blue mountains along which the I settlers drifted to the interior marked an 

 era in the progress of the colony. Since then stock had increased by tho million as the holders by thousands. The easy but tedious route -.'.cross to Port Phillip in the value and flocks and herds, considering the age of the settlement, was immense and drove matters of the sort with the force of a Vulcan. From the very first the future Victoria secured a prestage unequalled by 

 any other amongst the distant possessions of the British Crown. The Majors line became the leading highway eventally fixing the crossing at the Goal burn (Seymour), from thence to the Eastern end of Mount Macedon. The overlanders parted coast ways or ventured along the northern side of the ranges. 

 Mr. Howe pushing in his cattle station upon the Vandimonian adventurers forming the future Gisbome, named after the first crown land commissioner. In 1836 the 

 Ebdens occupied Carlsruhe. These early holders looked round for an ample scope of well watered country. Till land near the coast became scarce, the smaller holders pushing in between round the future Kyneton, the roving flock masters found the hills and valleys clothed witli n rich carpet ing of pastures, in perfect contrast with the 

 barren character of tlie northern county. .There was no comparison. Their knowledge -so far leading to the conclusion, that dry seasons were the rule rather than the excep tion and the value of a well watered country was most desirable. The change was too re markable to remain unnoticed even by the early pioneers. While the ridges coastward held out all sufficient encouragement for those hardy overlafiders, to give them the preference. 

 Nor could those early occupants bo answer able for the evils that late comers attributed to the grasping squatter who received very little encouragement from the authorities who made no effort to cope with the new order of things that had arisen. While the effeminacy of the aborigines in their oposi 

 tion was scarcely a matter for discussion as to the danger. The unlimited extent of country left the overlnnders free to secure all they could get while in the absence of population, with this class of men, public opinion became donimant as we have stated in claiming their right to reward for the rislc they hud incured. 

 Thus it wa3 the squatting overlanders drifted alon^ the Major's line�the Sydney Goliaths, owners of countless flocks and herds with uninterrupted regularity. Then as to 

 selecting, it was anywhere on reaching the bounds of occupation, they could pitch their tents, or rather a tarpaulin was more in vogue to rest for a time, they started their drays for supplies and wait for tlieir return. Flour, sugar, tea and tobacco the very highest style of luxuries which their extravagance per 

 mitted. 

 It was thus the'firsfc dray track was marked through the blaok forest, as it was named. The entire forest was one stretch of blackened timber from the bush fires started by the whiteman in his progress through the un occupied district. For they could camp here. 

 there or any where, there was nothing to prevent it, if food and water were sufficient to induce tliemtufixtheirhoniestead.TheVandemonians had in the spirit of enterprise secured the land immediately 011 the coast. 

 Through this cause Soldier's Flat on the Campnspie had a beginning in the Governor Gipps requesting the military to keep watch and ward over the desolate white and blackman. The former had certainly so far over stepped the bounds of common humanity, till ho had been 'compelled to mete out an example,as he doclared his inten tion of Bupressing the intercourse between the races, and if possible the unfortunate tribes from injury and suffering. 

 Just before our tale opens the Governor had sent several white men in the older 

 district to the gallows, for their barbarous 

 and wonton cruelty in the treatment of these unfortunate people. Those whites who had suffered abused their advantage, and looked upon the denizens of the forests as they did the common animals of their sport, outrag ing every feeling of humanity and Christian precept. 

 The intercourse between the blackman, and the white felon were, as may be sup posed, of a terrible character, far too dark a picture to be even set out on the page of history. The darkest of all the many dark pictures on record, in connection with the early Australian settlements, till they had leached a point, that in the interest of humanity the authorities were compelled to act .in the hope of arresting the cool blooded atrocities which came to be openly 

 committed. Commendable as it was and approved of by the general voice of the bettor thinking of the community, their after attempts ran into the extremo and became equally a failure. The former laxity of the government had allowed the cruelties to proceed too far, for which they were justly blamed. When forced to act their action was hurried and injudiciously ill advised, their future proceeding proving quite boyond their eiforts to maintain order, on the line of sottlement. The mode and manner wore simply a deulsion. Wise in good intention which led them to enforce the extreme course as an act of justice. But the arrangement was quite uneffectual in coping with the difliculties, supported as they were with armed soldiers from a 

 regiment of the line. The habitual system of military rulo, however capable for the organisation of armed men, in drilling them into united action for the purpose of war, field movements, and such achievements as human butchery requires, may be all very well. If the government, of a colony, even of the felon population was it one of U1030 great mistakes, that was committed before the true principle of colonisation camu to bo genorally under stood, and has caused more misery in these noble British settlements, than can ever be 

 atoned for on earth. 

 The initiation of the more humane management, under the black protectorate 

 was the result. Introduced to meet the difficulties of tho position, brought especially into existence for tho purpose of doing the best they could for tho unfortunate abori gines, but while they provided for the more humanizing power and influence of the new scheme,tlioy cling to the relics of the old. If the presence of the soldiers, and the action under the protectorate hud been as eflicient, as it was otherwise, there was a frontier line of hundreds of miles, covered by a sparse and scattered population, ever vary ing and changing of itself, fnr too gigantic an undertakingfor suchasystem of supervision to prove effective. 

 The experience of the authorities in the older settlement, had enabled them, accord 

 ing to their military lights, to understand the necessity as well as the usefulness of utilising the veterns of the line as border troopers for the purpose of guarding the frontier. It was a happy thought, the transforming of the soldier from the red to the 

 bjuc jacket as occasion required. | For this purpose tjioy \\vere ecut to distant outposts. In this they were rather anticipating the necessity of their presence than from any actual strife which had taken place. 

 They were tho representatives of the nciv course adopted by the government, in tho person of the protector, short)}' aftpp reaching this disr tant point, Bulleen Bulloen, on the lino of 

 settlement-. But the strangest idea was in piopounding the means of civilization under that of peace and war, leading the abori ginal mind to theorise over the conflicting r.mingi.ment, original enough in all con 

 science. 

 The effect of this double course of policy, in its introduction at ona and the same time, wis to breed strife and bloodshed, for the one,and discontent amongst the others. 

 Instinctively the aborigines soon gavo proof in the inannor the duties of the protec torate were exercised, as they quickly dis 

 covered how favourable the protector was to' tlieir interests and cunningly used the know ledge to the annoyance of the whites. Not only waa the Boudgury white fellow pro efffrefy but Ijo \\yas invgaty4 Vrjth material 

 authority, that was not always discreetly used. ( 

 To the insbphi'Jticated aboriginal mind, it complicated matters attending his presence, in whifch ;ho 'exercised the powers of the double officiers in controlling soldiers, ;vs well as protecting, the aborigine. 

 Nor did .the dark skin rest satisfied as soon 09'he so far understood the power of these conflicting forces that were in some way equally favorable to secure him protec I bion/. "Very naturally his bearing became in 

 solent as it ultimately increased the troubles 

 with the whites. 

 I �'Thes effect of this ill judged proceeding:, I were soon- apparent. Amongst the whites, 

 it simply increased their caution in dealing j -with those concerned. The squatters could 

 scarcely be expected to have any great control over their servants, however willing thoy may have -been to shield the aborigines; from the consequence of the intercourse. Then again, when you considered the class of man whose'selfishness would as a matter of course lead up to many acts of violence regard less of'all Tisk, it may be comprehended how perplexing the position was, these acts of violence, being follwed by retaliation and revenge, without distinction, as to age, sex or color,- of coarse in keeping with black 

 fellows sense of justice. But an ounce of led, had more effect than the feeble arm of the ancient occupant of the soil,however able he was to sling a boomerang or throw a spear. In their weak efforts to punish the white man, the difference in their weapons render" ing them completely helpless, in openly opposing them, till trusting in their in doinetabie spirit of revenge they resorted to stratagem, striking down the innocent with the guilty. There was 110 time along the frontier, but what the whites believed them selves perfectly able to cope with the darkskiris, as indeed they were. 

 The class of gentlemen who invested in squatting � property jit least a large pro portion, were exclusive enough in avoiding the intercourse, personally, with few ex ceptions and generous enough to have pre vented any outrage upon the helpless poople. But whatever was the character of the whites, in their social" relations of life, the ill 

 juageu policy ot the authorities seriously einbarrassed'and perplexed all parties. 

 To some extent it increased the feeling of danger, amongst the whites bordering on the rout skirts of the line of occupation, as the summer of 1837 advanced, and still more as tho autumn and the winter of 1838 approached 

 as already stated. 

 But to return to Bulleen Bulleen, while this spirit had long before its occupation, been growing' slowly stronger between the ancient owners, and the new occupants on the frontier, the light hearted Mary Martin was betimes attending to her usual duties, as she was seen-often during the day, dashing on horseback across the undulating hills, to disappear.through the mazes of the forest, in search of the straggling homestead herd, as the milkers' were termed. Once on horse back, she never seemed to fear either black or white. Having been reared on the 1 frontier, she. had learned instinctively to 

 guaru herself from surprise, so, th.it slie braved the risk with perfect indifference in a danger. that might have deterred the weaker fears "of her own sex. 

 Mary Mar; in felt at perfect peace with her cjarkskjunod - brothers and sisters, as she termed'them. While with the lubras, young and old, was she a general favorite, through her kindly manner and liberal disposition. Tlio youiig lubras in particular held her in great veneration, she proving kind and gonerious, as, far as her limited means enabled her to bestow her favors in the shape of ribbon and colored handkerchiefs, of themselves trifles, but they assisted her iu maintaining a feeling of friendship, betwoen hcajssnd the occupants of the Mia 

 Mias. ! 

 The early autumn rains had fallen by this ?time, for another season on the parched soil' refreshing the young pastures, that were still,, if short in growth, sweet and 

 pleasant to the taste of the stock depasturing over them,but driving them still further into "the bush, as the forest was termed. 

 It was in ono of these rides, that Miss Martin had followed her truant milkers over ridge and ~'r. gully, stopping betimes, to gather the bright, fresh, blooming, early (lowers in: their gorgeous profusion of every tint, yellow, pink and blue, eaeli new branch bending under its load of blossoms, one | waving more beautiful than the another, filling the atmosphere with the aromatic fragrance of their perfume, pleasing to the senses as they were to the sight. Hero �nd | there had she stopped and gathered the 

 choicest she could select from the abundance of many clusters. Stripping them from the ; trees and shrubs, on the hills and broken ] ridges, by the dry channels of the creeks, where hung the variegated honeysuckle and wattle blossoms. She had been accustomed to do 80, through hor childhood as slie roamed: at large, through the quiet solitude 

 of the Australian bush. The mazes of the 

 deep forests she had intuitively learned to thread 'without the slightest fear in retracing her coursp, amidst what to others, would have seemed an endless labrynth. 

 In sheer girlish sport and playfulness had she decorated her broad leafed cabbage tree hat, then, the particular wear of young and old, rich or poor, amongst the first artiolea of colonial manufactory, generally the produce of the prison hands. Not content with this' fantastic display of girlish 

 frolic she ? went on to undo the ribbon that usually bound up lier brown hair, leaving the long tresses to fall in their rich profusion, round her neck and shoulders. Then carefully cutting from the richest of her bush flowers, she gathered thein into " a bouquet for the purpose of carrying home to grace the interior of the i rough dwelling on the Bulleen Bulleen Creek. 

 Sportively if not gaily adorned with tho 

 wild flowers that mingled with her brown tresses, but which gave her rather, a grotesque appearanco as the gipsy character, being quiet toher tastes. "Never mind" she said softly to herself, "there's no one near to see, and it pleases my fancy in fantasatic decorations.'' So she prepared to hurry down tKe tracks of her stray cattle, on the head of one of those unnamed dry crocks, to find not only her own charge but a few other strangers amongst them. But whence they came was much easier asked than answered; they were the first she had seen within range of Bulleen Bulleen, and their presence was rather signiticient as to a new neighbour. 

 ? To round up the whole, as it is styled in bush parlance, would occupy but a few minutes. Their presence exciting her in terest, as it was assuredly an intimation of 

 other occupants of crown lands being some where near, she stopped to calculate over the possibility that whitemen -\\yeye in the neighbourhood, now settlers perhaps. But she understood no water could be found, nearer than the Loddou river, and these cattle were seemingly from a station, rather than from an overland party ; why she should so decide was only understood by experience. 

 Miss Martin,in the spirit that guided most residents on the frontier,was anxious enough to see neighbours settling near them, and ready enough to welcome a now arrival, although,- inclined to hold as much country as they possible could. On this account their cattle were an exception. On any con sideration thoy could not be allowed to 

 remain, as tliey were ramblers and would disturb her own. She expected with her spirited little horse, however, to soon sepcrate them. Thus musing over tho fact, she quietly proceeded to collect tho whole runibor with tho intention of dropping them on the way home. 

 - She had scarcely set about the task in getting them together, before the sharp ring of a stockwhip, camo down tl]o forest, a further intimation that tho owner or his stockman, was near, and had seen tho cattle. Well trained cattle answering the ring of the whip by preparing to start back towards their own camping ground. Without troubling herself further, Miss Martin drew within the shade of nil ancient gum-tree, inclined to allow tho stranger to soouro his cattlo, and 

 go avoiding im interview. If he Iiacl dis covered her presonco whoover ho was, would in all probability speak. That he had seen her figure on horseback was soon evident as the beat of the horses, hoofs rapidly approached, before slie had well decided how"to'act, tfycy sjtQQd facie to fnco, tho sun burnt, bronzed young squattor, and the youthful bush girl. To each it was a mutual surprise, to the stockman tho most unaccountable, as lie sat and gazed with perplexed admiration, at tho figure before him. To meet in such a place, and under such circumstances, as their surroundings presented, was.ovident so unexpected. He remained as if'spechless for a few minutes, the horses however saluting after their kind, 

 Mis?-Martin's pyo-lgshes drop^cl undev 

 the other's ardent gaze, "with her faco crimsoned in its hue till it strongly contrasted with the wild flowers in which she was 

 decorated.
