 [WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.] CHAPTER XVII. 

 BY IRIS. 

 The hot exhausting summer, with its fierce north winds, blowing for three days, and generally ending in a violent change back to almost the cold of winter, was passing away. 

 The harvest had been exceptionally good, and the price of wheat in England good enough to par the exporters of grain a fair profit. Great golden hay staoks stood inflvoryyard; but in Roland Trevor's there were five, for it waa by means of his hay rather than his wheat that he expected to reap the reward of his labours. Eu anxieties were by no means over; for though the harvest was now gathered in, and the neighbouring farmers felt that they were at last seonrein having sold all their wheat, except what was being ground at the mill into floor and bran or crashed for meal for their own household use, there was an ever present dread in the minds of those whose future pro spects were bound np to any great extent in the sweet-smelling haystacks which made a new feature in every landscape. For the last two or three days long white cloud columns had been seen rising, apparently from among the sombre masses of the scrub, against the weary ing blue glare of the sky. These columns were apt at sunset to take a brownish tint, often deepening into chooolate, and just before dark even Mercy's inexperienced eye observed that the moving black-gray mass was nothing leas than smoke. "Ten," Mr.Forrestsaid,oneFridayevening,it wasthe4thFebruary," there are somelarge bush fires in the Willunga scrub. Some one burning cattle out, I suppose. We Bhall be pretty safe if the wind keeps in this easterly direction, but if it goes round to the north we shall have to keep a sharp lookout upon our fenoes." " The wind's safe to turn to the north, and before morning, too," Mrs. Harding declared. " Who lights these fires P" Mercy asked. " If anyone could toll us that," Mr. Forrest replied, " there would be little difficulty in putting a stop to the ruinous practice. The Government has offered large rewards for in formation which would lead to the conviction of offenders, and a law has lately been passed forbidding anyone to light fires out of doors between December and the beginning of April without first ploughing a strip of ground round the spot where the fire is to be lit. I scarcely think the ploughing a sufficient precaution, for a spark wul fly to a great distance, and while the grass is so long and dry it will burn like tinderwith the very smallestenoouragement. All sorts of theories have been put forward to account for fires, from the suggestion that they are kindled by farmers who want to dear scrub lands in good time to begin ploughing with the first rains, which are expected in March, to the friction of dry boughs under the hot ?un." " That's all rubbish!" Mrs. Harding said emphatically. "We know of certain persons who have burnt the scrub over and over to find miasing cattle." " They find 'em sometimes before they lost 'em," Walter said with a grin and a roll of his aauoer eyes. "Do you remember, Martha, when Mrs. Smith came to dine with us onoe, and we had taken a good deal of trouble to get a joint of -veal, thinking it would be a treat for her, as they only kept sheep at that time, she said: * Good gracious! Fancy putting veal before me, my dear. lam tired of the very sight of it'" " Well P" Mercy said, not understanding the drift of the story, while Martha laughed boisterously at the reminiscence. "Martha said," Louisa pursued, "that it was the first we had tasted tor many a day, for my father preferred to rear all the calves, and she had paid a good price to Jabez Inwards for this piece which was on Ike table. 'Just 

 fancy,' Mrs. Smith oried, ' buying veal when the scrub is full of calves! Walter keeps kan garoo dogs, don't he ?'" "Don't repeat that story, Louisa," Mr. Forrest said sternly. " I was not present when Mrs. Smith confessed to her dishonest practice. Let us hope she has cultivated more distinct ideas of right and wrong since then." Louisa pouted, aud secretly wished she had not told the story till her father had left the breakfast table. Mr. Forrest opened the front door and looked out. In the north there were two^ great branches of white smoke, forming a gigantic V. His practised oyo saw that the fire from which the smoke proceeded mudt be still at a great distance, and he folt tolerably assured that it was rising in a direction where no particular harm could be done, and that if only the wind would veer round to the south or west the flames would soon be extinguished At present tho wind was easterly and bitterly cold, though by midday it was likely enough to be almost unbearably hot. "We must plough a few furrows on this side of the house on Monday, Walter," he said to his son as they walked towards the stables. " I shall feel easier. I hope Trevor will do the same. He has more to lose than we so far as his hay is concerned. Ours is pretty well out of the way of sparks at the foot of this slopo, but his are just where they would most easily ignite, on tho north side, and I fanoy those five staoks pretty well represent all his capital. I shall suggest it to him this morning if I see him; it is not a very busy time with him just now." "He is in town," Walter replied, "and won't be home till to-night. Oh, the stacks are right enough." "It is to be hoped bo," Mr. Forrest replied, "for we can't well take any precautions for their safety until Monday." The wind blew all day long from the east, and though the sun was hot it was not unbearable. In the evening they again saw emoke clouds of the tint of burnt umber rising behind the hills, but by that time the wind had died down, and complete stillness reigned everywhere. The creeks were all dry now and they seldom heard the trilling of frogs; but the very birds were silent before sunset, and only the hum of inseots or the tinkling of sheep and cattle bells mingled with the distant roar of the sea. Indoors the atmosphere grew oppressive as the sun went down, in a sky of such lurid flaming clouds that the reflection dyed the waters of the bay with a blood-red tinge. Flocks of geese and pelicans flew sea ward, the former uttering*a weird cry as they floated like blaok blots against the sky. " Come to tea," Mrs. Harding said to Mercy and Louisa from the opon window of the draw ing-room, as they paced the terrace in hope of intercepting a sea breeze. They turned and entered the house, following Martha to the dining-room�where the meal was waiting for them, and, in spite of the weather, looked inviting. Mr. Forrest entered the passage almost at the same moment, ushering Mr. Robinson in before him. During the progress of the meal the visitor told them that there was a report that huge bush fires had broken out in the south-west districts, and had already done much damage to the fences of fanners. Mr. Forrest looked anxious. "We are pretty safe here," he said, "for the harvest is all gathered in; but I can't help feeling anxious about young Trevor's hay staoks. Has anyone seen him to-day V ' No one had, and Mr. Robinson gave it as his opinion that Roland would not return until Saturday night. After tea Mr. Forrest asked for some musio, and Mercy went towards the piano. " Ah, yes!" Mr. Robinson cried, delighted. " Come, Mrs. Harding and Miss Louisa, let as all join oar voioes in 'Vital Spark.'" " Bat have you the music with youf" Mercy asked, not feeling particularly disposed to assist in the proposed hymn. "Oh ! no, my dear miss! but that is of no consequence! it is the spirit, you know, the devout Christian spirit, wnioh shall attune our voices. I am considered to sing a very good tenor." " I am afraid I know of no spirit so powerful as that which you describe. I find it necessary to know either the musio or tbe words before I can accompany a hymn or attune my voice." Here she caught Mr. Forrest'b rebuking eye, and blushed deeply. "Sing me the tune, Louisa," she said, desperately seating herself at the piano. Mr. Robinson and Martha cared nothing for an accompaniment, and the instant Louisa began to suggest the hymn-tune they joined in, and Louisa, apparently not thinking it signified to explain, uplifted her voice with the others. Mr. Forrest hastened from the room as the shrill nasal shrieks of his daughters, almost drowned by the odd inharmonious falsetto of Mr. Robinson, filled the air. The slumbering cat upon the hearth-rug started up with angry growl, and with a tail swollen to twice its size. He made a bound at the window, which had been closed to exolude the mosquitoes and a myriad, other tormenting inseots which congre gate about the house on a hot evening. An ugly mongrel, while had accompanied Mr. Robinson, and was now under the table, flew out with a snarl at the oat. Walter seized him by the tail, while he held to the carpet by his p.iws. The oat sprang down from a chair on which he had jumped, and fled out of the room followed by the dog, who snatched his tail from Walter's grasp. As soon as the hymn, with its endless re petitions of the last line and curious embellish ments of the original tune, came to an end, Mercy escaped to her own room, to think about the danger inourred by Roland's property from the surrounding fires. She slipped out of door?, and when her eyes had become acoustomed to tho darkness she thought she could see dull patches against the sky, where the stars were blurred and reddened by smoke. There was no wash or murmur of the sea�a deadly still ness reigned everywhere over the bay; but from the far eastern shore came a subdued but inoessant roar, like the sound of a distant battle, as huge billowsshattered themselves npon the beach. It seemed to Mercy very much warmer out of doors than in. She strained her eyes to see if she could not perceive a 

 twinkle of light from Mr. Trevor's house, but all was darkness beyond the sombre masses of indistinguishable tree-tops. She heard the guest preparing to take leave of the family, and not wishing to trust her hand to the clammy paw of the worthy deacon she stood back among the sheltering shadows of the house. Walter ran out, and down th� incline to the stable, hospitably intent upon bringing Mr. Robinson's horse to tho gate. "Well; I will wish yon a good evening, brother Forrest," Mr. Robinson said; " I see your excellent son approaching with my horse. Good night, Miss Martha. Sally hopes that you will soon go to ccc her. She always profits greatly by your counsel. Ah, thank you, Walter; you are a worthy lad." Mr. Forrest and his daughters went indoors, but Mercy feared to move lest the departing visitor should see her, and she still stood behind the open side of the French window. " I fear, my good young man, I must ask you to lift me up. My legs are something short to reach tha stirrup, and the hone is somewhat high " "Ah ! All right!" Walter assented, catch ing the stout little man by the knee, and elova ting Lim so vigorously that poor Mr. Robinson was hanging head downwards over the opposite side of toe horse, whilo Walter still held him by tho leg. After a good many unavailing efforts on young Mr. Forrest's part to get him back he was obliged to let him fall, as gently as possible, on his hands the other Bide, gradually drawing his body after him, and breaking his fall as much as possible by cling ing to the stirrup leather. " What a shame of Walter!" Meroy thought, angry with herself for being unable to repress a laugh at the ridiculous figure cut by poor Mr. Robinson; and aa tho young man passed her on the terrace as he returned, chuckling, to the house, she stopped out of the darkness and said: " I felt ashamed of you just now, Mr. Walter. I never saw anyone who had so little knowledge of the saoredness of hospitality." " Hey !" Walter cried, a little startled by this accusing apparition. " You heard what I eaid. It is no business of mine, of course, but I think you should re member that Mr. Robinson is an eldorly man if you forget that he is your father's guest." Walter laughed awkwardly. " I can't understand you, Miss Aid. You can see a joke sometimes, and at others yon are awfully shocked at a bit of fun." " I hate praotical joking," Mercy said indig nantly. "Itis vulgar and detestable." Sho felt a little guilty when she remembered that she had laughed, and thought herself bound to confess her weakness. *? lam angry with you because I laughed just now when I saw Mr. Robinson looking ridiculous�but it was mean and detestable of me, and very wrong and most inhospitable of yon." Walter looked at her in genuine surprise. "Well," he said slowly, "if it's wrong, of course�Miss Aid, look here: if you'll ask me to promise you, I'll never play a praotioal joke again." " Oh, no !" Mercy said proudly. " I never ask for promises. You know my wish, if that is not enough" , and she swept past him into the house. Walter was not quick of perception, but he understood, and felt a little blank, as he thought of all he had pledged himself to, in his momentary enthusiasm for this creature, who, without effort on her own part, had worked such curious revolution in the household, of which she had been but a few months a mem ber. Walter was very far from feeling any thing like the affeotion for Meroy which his father, mother, and sisters experienced, and which made it simple enough for them to fall under her influence; it was soaroely within the possibility of Walter's nature that he should feel purely disinterested affeotion for anyone, and yet the force and p�wer of Mercy's cen trality compelled his nature to gravitate towards hers, like the rest. He west so far as to feel sure that he could never feel comfortable in playing the most innocent trick upon anyone while Mercy Aid was in the house, or likely to become aware of his doings. Saturday was a wearying wasting day Mosquitoes swarmed into the house, in spite of closed doors and windows, and even Mr. For rest and Walter stayed indoors all daj. There was no wind at all. The sea looked as hot as the sky; not a wave broke its unruffled surface, not a cloud broke the unvarying blue plain with a shadow. Tho air quivered blindingly with brilliant tremors, tho whole earth was transformed into a desert of sun-glare. The meridian was passed, at length, and the sultry afternoon declined through shades of burning amber, growing hotter and hotter. A slight wind aroso towards 4 o'clock in the afternoon, unmistakably from the north-east, the roar of the sea on the eastern coast of the bay sounded nearer and more crashing. Solid triple pyramids of smoke-cloud tipped with blazing silver appeared all along the horizon, from north to west, rising high abovo the bulwark of the hills against the fierce blue of the sky. Mr. Forrest wandered in and out of tho hou�e, uneasy and re&tless. " I have half a mind now to try to plough a few furrows, Walter," he said, wiping away the perspiration which streamed from his fore head, and making a dash at Borne mosquitoes at the same time. " You'd better keop the other half, sir. The ground's as hard as a brick. It would be about as easy as ploughing a wall. There's no need to fretyet a while. Those fires are a long way off. You can't see the smoke move." Mr. Forrest was not reassured, but he did not really know what to do. If the wind should turn to the north and blow strongly it seemed to him inevitable that this large bush fire should be guided towards his fences, yet he knew of no precaution whioh he could take against it. He thought of Roland ' onco or twice as towards evening he paced the terrace and watched the fiery scenery in the western sky and let his eyes wander over the opal sea spreading glassy smooth and motionless from east to west fling ing up the blaokness of rooks and islands in sombro relief against its almost colourless milky surface. Along the road he saw a horse man riding, who turned towards Trevor's corner, and after watohing for a few moments 

 he was rewarded by seeing the same united? figure of horse and man close to the cottage, and he knew that Roland must have returned. [to be conttstted.]
