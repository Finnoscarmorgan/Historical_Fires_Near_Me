 CHAPTER XXIT. 

 It was only a spasmodic blow, and in a few boura soon went down. In the morning at daybreak, the wind was steady, and the sun rose bright over the horizon, and the sea had a fresh crisp- ness, about it, after the stirring up of the day before. We. stood into the West side of Malayta and anchored at noon, stopping two days and obtaining three recruits. At ten o'clock, as the wind, made'from the south ard, we started to beat down the coast; my interpreter, before leaving, telling me to be careful 

 of the tribes about twehtv miles down, 

 as they had killed a- white mau and 

 wounded two of his black boat's-crew from a Samoan recruiting schooner only one moon ago. 

 About ' four Relock that afternoon, smoke was seen on the, beach, and as The Blackbird stood into the land a lot of natives were observed waving to us. We lowered the boats and went iu shore to a small creek where they were as- . sembl�d. None of them could speak English, they could only point to the hills and say " Johnny " meaning that one of tiieir tribe who could talk was away up in the hush. Thinking there was no chance of recruiting any boys here we sailed back to the ship, and had just got alongside, when the captain told me the natives were running down the beach waving again. I said I supposed it was Johnny and as the other boat was wanted to sound for anchorage, in a sort of double bay to be seen about a mile to the south'ard, I went back alone to pick np Johnny. 

 The Kanakas have a different way of beckoning from white men ; when they want you te come, to them they seem to wave you away, and when they wish you to clear �nt they beckon ypu towards them. I have good cause to be acquainted with their eccentric mode of signalling. On my first trip in 4he " Undine 9 off the black beach at Tanna, we switched on to the wrong code; but they gave us the right key, a leaden one ; and we bad to pull for our lives . to get round a point that shut ont the bullets. 

 When we reached the beach, I said, " Ar� you Johnny P" . he answered : " Yes, me Johnny," and as he stepped into the boat said;-** Yon Gnv'mentP alright, me go alohga ship." The Blackbird was standing out the bay as we came on board, and Johnny went to the captain, pointing to a long strip of water to the south'ard of the bay, ^ run- ning in between high hills and said : " Very good ship be sleep there." But' the mate's boat returned unsuccessful in finding any anchorage, and the wind falling light, we prudently kept on out 

 te sea. 

 This rather disgusted Johnny, who growled :-" No good ship he walk about all night, very good ship he sleep." We stood off and on all night, the wind keep- ing steady in the open. 

 I had spoken to Johnny that evening saying, "Very good Johnny you come aionga Mackay;" but Johnny replied " Me no want to go aionga Queensland new Guv'inent, me no long time come back work aionga'Noumea. 

 After, dinner that night. I said, " Johnny you eatchum kai kai." 

 He answered, "Yes me catchumplenty, no gammon alenga ' that fella- bulla-, macon " (meat). 

 : I again asSed him if he would recruit, .hie: jseply to nie was,' " No good you �Bkumjne again, guVment/me sgeakum true first time; suppose m% Drantum go, me go ; suppose me no .wantum go, me ho go ; me no long time back aionga island, eatchum one fella Mary, no wantum leavam that fella just yet." 

 The captain gave him half a dozen sticks of tobacco, and as. he pnt them in the Blit in the lobe of his ear, Johnny told him that "plenty boy aionga his tribe would go and work aionga Queens- land." 

 We stood into the land at daybreak and after breakfast, the boats sailed into the mouth of the creek, we had called at�, yesterday. Johnny got out pf the boat and talked to the chief for a few minutes. 

 He came hack and asked for some pipes and tobacco for him, which I gave. He then told me that he would "go up aionga bush," pointing to some high hills a mile or two away, and said " big ofella sing sing aionga that fella place, kiUum plenty piggy pig bimeby when sun he go down me come aionga beach plenty boy." 

 , " All right Johnny,'' I said, and we sailed down to the vessel, which was anchored in ninety fathoms of water no, more than two. hundred and fifty yards from the land. .' - , - ' ". 

 While at lunch the anchor watch re 

 forted about thirty natives on the beach. 

 jumped in the boat and pulled tb them, 

 and found they were Joh nny's . mates ; j but nothing would induce them to recruit. Any chance of obteining-Boys -here was for some reason hopeless, so we sailed down the coast about' five 

 miles to where there was another village, and secured one recruit, . v . 

 It was getting late when we pulled back to the vessel, arriving'alongside just : as the sun was fretiuUy dipping hie head' 

 in ah ocean �f crimson and gold. . My boat .was � fasteT'one than the other and 

 . ? ' � x 

 reached the. vessel about five hundred yards ahead of her. The captain sang ont to me a� we were hooking on to the davit falls, that Johnny, the interpreter, was hailing the ship from the beach. I looked round and seeing a native as the captain described, gave orders when the other boat cane to the vessel, to put the recruit . aboard and follow me ; and slewing my boat's bead round, pulled into where Johnny was shouting and 3umping about. We baoked into the beach, but the mau had mysteriously disappeared. 

 Blessing him in my impatience, I stood up in the eternsheets and saw a crowd of natives sitting under a tope of mango trees up a wide river some two hundred yards away, waving for us to come. I remember saying " bother them," j or words to that effect, for I was I hungry, and had been humbugged a good I deal that day, and knew dinner was 

 waiting for me aboard ; and as they did I not show any disposition to come to meet us, I ordered the crew to pull away and steered for the breakers. We jumped them safely and ran iuto the river bank with the force of the sea, and were then carried out again with the force of the current, in spite of all my. efforts with the steerNoar to heep her straight and my orders to back starboard. 

 . The river was shallow, but the .current strong, andi eaidrto three bf my black- fellows, "jump out, man Tanna man Pama, and Penni Mai and walkutn boat up alonga river." 

 When they werewalking her up, I stood up the better to see and Avoid the snags which had been washed down by last freshet. The river took a slight bend, and in helping the boat round the blade slipped on a small sunken boulder and I lunged forward, missing my grip, and stumbled on to the white sailor pull- ing stroke. Luckily for me I did, for a bullet whistled over nie, and the flash and report of a number of rifles told me I had escaped from/ an ambuscade by the hair of my head. 

 I dropped the oar like a hot iron and fired my revolver in the direction of the 

 ferns and bushes where the natives were concealed. At the fifth shot my revolver jambed. My rifle, a celt's repeater, was ready to band, and I drew it hurriedly from the cleats, and got a bead on Johnny who was taking careful aim at me .iron� behind a cocoa-nut tree, and I pulled first, and he gave an expiring yell 

 ashefelL 

 The firing slowed. I told the boys who were crouching in the water behind the boat to jump in, and giving the rifle to stroke to keep on firing, collared her steer oar and swept her round as ehe .was being carried down by the rush of the stream, and we passed out over the breakers in safety. 

 We did not suffer any damage ; only a couple of bullet holes through the gun- wale ; and we met the mate's boat com- ing to our aetistance when we were pull- ing back te the ship. 

 " It was pretty sharp while it lasted, Mr. Wyndham," the Skipper said when 

 I climbed aboard. 

 "Tea," I replied. "I don't think Johnny will talk agaiu, let alone inter- pret." 

 We stayed there the next, day. Np signs of boys could be seen, they not dar- ing to show themselves after their little piece pf treachery. 

 The b�ate were lowered again in the' 

 afternoon to recruit down the coast. 

 Before going, however, I pulled into the narrow inlet, where Johnny wanted us to anchor, and found the water very deep; the mate could get no bottom with the deep sea lead line twenty feet from the land'� edge, which shelved put that distance and went down as strajeht a� a wall. - Their idea was to get ai ia lhere to drift ashorei as no wind could reach us, unless it came from the ocean, and thea ^re-would .'have had np room to: heat out. This stratagem was too apparent. 

 . At daybreak we left, and worked down the coast getting an odd boy here and - there at thev different villages. One �lace where there was a narrow river, a 

 oy came and told us "plenty boy"; about a mile up the river wanted to go to Queensland, and he would go up the liver with us to show us the village, but the mate "had been there before." He told the hoy if the others wished to come down to the beach we would wait. 

 The Boy went away as if to tell them, i and the mate turning to me said, " Til bet you a pipe of tobacco or a month's wages, we won't see him again or any other Boys." Seeing the mate knew something I risked tue smaller wager, and after waiting an hour, jl told him I owed him a pipeful. 

 He told me that when recruiting in the brigantine Lurline in this same river two years before, the very same message was given and they rowed about a mile upthe river till it shallowed and the boats grounded, and the natiyesin ambush fired and killed one white , man and wounded four-others, \\"; . .
