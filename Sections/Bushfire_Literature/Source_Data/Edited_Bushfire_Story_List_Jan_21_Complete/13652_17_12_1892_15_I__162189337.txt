 Foe Young People.

 CHAPTER I. 

 ' Well, boy6, you have indeed brought home a wealth of Christmas bushes and lovely wild flowers, and I'm sure your mother will be well pleased.' Thus spoke Captain Brabazon, as bis two young sons, accompanied by their tutor, drove up to the verandah of their roughly-built and still unfinished residence known as the head station of Burraga run. 

 The light springcart was loaded to its utmost capacity with fern3, palms, Christmas bushes, and a great variety of beautiful wild flowers, which grew in great profusion in the neighbouring forest. The two boys alighted from the vehicle, and joyfully received : the caresses of their mother, who just then made her I appearance at the door of the house. I Burraga station was situated near the north-eastern : border of the tableland of New England, and had only been redeemed from the wilderness some two or three years before the time of the commencement of this narrative. In the year 1833 Captain William Brabazon, ? accompanied by his wife and two sons, aged respec , tively 11 and 9* years, arrived in Sydney, after what : was considered in those days a fair passage of 136 ! days. Like many others of his class, the Captain had i retired from the British Army, and resolved to try ' to better his fortune as a pastoralist in the then almost terra incognita � the Australian bush. Imme diately after bis arrival in Sydney, as was customary, he presented hta credentials to the Governor, who in due time issued his certificate, in conformity with the existing law, empowering all naval and military officers retired from the service to select land to the extent of 5000 acres or upwards, as the case might be. At this time sheep-farming may be said to have been almost in its infancy. The recently discovered , tableland of New England attracted the attention of most new arrivals who were desirous of taking up new country for . squatting purposes. Distant bush lands � or, indeed, any other lands � in New South Wales, at the time alluded to, had but very little value attached to them ; 5s per acre was the nominal price demanded by the Government : but huge areas of land in the unsettled districts were freely alienated by the latter to various applicants, both civil and military. Under such con ditions Captain Brabazon was advised to take up country on leasehold in one of the newly-discovered unsettled districts. After mature deliberation, he finally resolved to selecta ' run ' in the distant wilds of New England. In those earlier days very little difficulty was ex perienced in selecting lands either in large or small blocks-; preliminaries were therefore quickly arranged, and Captain Brabazon was in a comparatively short space of time constituted as the virtual possessor of 150,000 acres of land, fitted for both pastoral and agricultural purposes, at a mere nominal rental. The Captain, with his family, had been located on Burraga station nearly three years when the incidents related in this narrative occurred. By dint of sheer perseverance and indomitable energy he had sur mounted the many obstacles attendant upon squatting in the early days of the colony, and notwithstanding the raidBof blacks, dingoes, and other prevalent evils the station appeared to prosper fairly, and had begun to assume a civilised and settled appearance. At the period alluded to the persons residing and employed at Burraga consisted of Captain Brabazon, his wite, and two sons� the elder, Bertie, aged 11, and Willie, 9� Mr. Vane (their tutor), George Rad cliffe (an old and faithful servant of the family who accompanied them from the old country), the free overseer, and two female and 12 male assigned servants. Unlike the majority of employers of con vict labour in those times, Captain Brabazon treated his people well, and was consequently faithfully and well served by them in return, while his wife and two sons were all but idolised by every soul residing on the station. It was on the 24th of December, 1836, which was one of those clear, bright, hot days so -generally prevalent at Australian Christmas time, that the cart already spoken of drew up at the verandah of Burraga House. The two lads, assisted by Mr. Vane, commenced to unload their store of shrubs and flowers, when the Captain intervened, saying : ' Had you not better take the horse out, and let us remove the bushes and flowers from the cart as we require them ?' ' Oh, no, father,' eagerly rejoined Bertie ; ' we must go for another load.' 'Why, surely,' said the Captain, 'we have already a sufficiency for all our requirements.' 'Yes, father,' answered Bertie ; 'but you for get the woolshed and the men's huts ; they must have their flowers and . bushes as well as our cottage, or I'm sure mother will not be well pleased.' The Captain and his wife exchanged glances and smiled approvingly, and the latter said : ? ' Had you not better get one of the men to go with you for the next load? I'm sure Mr. Vane must be fatigued.' ' Quite the reverse, I assure you,' replied that gentleman. 'I shall be very pleased to accompany the boys again.' ' Well, here comes Tambah. Take him with you,' said Mrs. Brabazon. ' His assistance will make your task all the easier.' At that moment an aboriginal lad was seen approaching leisurely across the paddock towards the house. He was attired in a gorgeous red shirt and moleskin trousers ; the latter encircled with a broad leather belt, from which depended a stockwhip rolled up into many coils. In appearance he was about 16 or 17 years of age, stalwart, lithe, and tall for bis years, and possessed of a remarkably intelligent cast of features, not often seen in others of his race. As he came nearer to the house a broad grin overspread his face, while the younger lad, Willie, hastened to meet him. -T|ambah's�yes evidently Bparkled with delight as the little fellow took him by the hand and exclaimed, somewhat loudly, ' I'm glad you have come, Tambah ; mother says you will go with us to get another load of bushes aiulflowers.' ' All rigHt, Willie. I go along,' replied the lad, speaking the words fluently. Then the two came up to the verandah and joined the others. As Tambah approached near to Captain Brabazon, he drew from his pocket a letter, which he handed to the latter with a polite bow, and then seated himself on the edge of the verandah with Bertie and Willie on either side of him. The Captain at once opened and read the missive. Then, addressing his wife, he said : ' My dear, this note is from Eadcliffe ; the foolish fellow will not come in to-morrow to eat his Christ mas dinner with us. He appears to have the blacks on his brain. He writes to say that the Tongoi blacks have again come down from the mountains, and have camped on the ranges within a mQe or two s of the outstation, and he is fearful, if they should ? discover his absence, they would attempt another raid on the sheep.' ' Poor old George ! ' replied Mrs. Brabazon piti fully, ' I think at times he worries himself need lessly. Ask Tambah� he will know� if these dreadful blacks are really camped in the ranges.' ' I can scarcely believe it,' said the Captain. ' After the dressing they got a tew months since I imagined that they had cleared out incontinently. Tell me, Tambah, have these Tongoi people come back again?' . . ,, � ' I no see him,' the lad replied. 'I hink Myall 

 Koree * sit down there. I see him fire in the ranges last night.' ' Then I don't believe it. Fires alone are no evidence of the blacks being there. Old George gets scared at once if he either sees or hears of a fire at any part of the run ; then he immediately arrives at a conclusion that blacks are about.' Saying which, . Captain Brabazon, turning to his wife, continued, ' That old stupid will not come in to-morrow and take his Christmas dinner with us ; he must not be allowed co go without it altogether ; we will send it out to him with a bottle of wine by Tambah in the morning, and I will ride over to see what's the matter nest day.' ' O father,' broke in Bertie, ' please allow Mr. Vane, Willie, and me to drive over iu the cart to morrow morning, and take with us his Christmas dinner. It is only four miles to the outstation, and Willie and I always like to wish old George a happy Christmas.' ' Yes,' said the Captain, ' a nice happy Christ mas he will have, fuming and fretting over the blacks. I have no objection to your going, but then Mr. Vaue has to be consulted. What does he say?' ' I shall be glad of the jaunt ' replied Mr. Vane, ' I also 'have a desire to pass the compliments of the season with George Radcliffe.' ' Well, lads, it is settled, providing your mother offers no objection ; but don't stay yarning with George ; be sure to be back in time for dinner, unless the Tongoi blacks make their Christmas dinner off you,' said the Captain, laughing heartily. ' By this time the cart had been denuded of its con tents, and Mr. Vane with the two boys and Tambah mounted into it, and then started off at a brisk pace for another load of Christmas bushes and wild flowers. Next day the summer sun rose in all its majestic splendour. . Not a breath of wind moved the leaves on the trees. The discordant and prolonged Hoohoo hoos of the laughing jackass were predominant in every direction. Parrots and cockatoos chattered and screamed as if in delight at the beauty of the surroundings. Countless numbers of small birds of various species and variegated plumage shimmered in the glow of the early sunlight as they flitted and twittered from bough to bough. Not a cloud obscured the sky, everything denoting the advent of a hot Christmas Day. The inmates of Burraga House were, as usual, early astir, and active pre parations for breakfast were being proceeded with, when Captain and Mrs. Brabazon appeared on the verandah accompanied by their two eons. All gazed with apparent delight at the profuse floral de corations which bedecked their simple rustic dwel ling. ' This is going to be a very hot day, boys,' said the Captain, addressing them. '? I would, prefer that you should not go over to the outstation this morning, but suffer Tambah to go in your stead.' ' Oh, Father,' said Bertie ' we shall be so much disappointed if you will not permit us to go. We are used to the heat, and will proceed leisurely, and in two hours at most will have returned ; besides, father, you know you promised us yesterday.' *' Yes, I did ; and I have no intention of breaking the promise I made, but I can plainly see that the heat will be most oppressive to-day; and, my dear,' continued the Captain, addressing his wife, ' 1 do not wish to disappoint the lads; see that they don their sunshades before they 6tart� tiiey will need them.' The family, including Mr. Vane, a few minutes later were seated at breakfast. After that had been duly discussed, a walk round the paddock was indulged in. After a tim^ the heat became so intense thaj; a retreat from the burning rays of the sun became a necessity, and all proceeded towards the woolshed. where the bell was sounding for prayers. Captain Brabazon was to be the preacher, and his congregation comprised all hands located on the station, numbering, male and female, about 20 souls all told. After the service was completed and the Captain had delivered an improvised sermon, having reference to the solemnities and reminiscences of the day they were celebrating, the congregation dispersed with mutual congratulations and good wishes, which were extended even to the aboriginal lad Tambah, who.-Stpmst be confessed, did not much comprehend the import of the ceremonies he had witnessed. Bertie and Willie, being now anxious to proceed on their impending visit to the outstation, at once directed their steps towards the stable, where the groom was awaiting them. All preliminaries com pleted, the springcart was driven up to the front door of the house, where Mrs. Brabazon soon put in an appearance, closely followed by one of the female domestics, carrying a basket, which contained the good things prepared for ' Old George's ' Christmas dinner. The basket was placed in the cart with many exhortations to the lads from their mother to take great care of it as well as themselves, and above all to be sure to return home in time for dinner. Mr. Vane And the two boys, having seated them selves in the vehicle, were preparing to depart when Tambah made his appearance, coming from the di rection of the rear of the cottage. ' Hullo, Tambah,' shouted Willie gleefully, 'jump up and come along with us.' Tambah took no heed of the invitation, but list lessly seated himself on the edge of the verandah, and, raising his eves slowly in the direction of the boy, said impressively, if not sadly, ' I no like to go ; I stay here and have Christmas dinner.' Then ad vancing towards the cart he addressed himself to Mr. Vane, and exclaimed in a louder tone of voice, and pointing to the direction they were about to take, ' You mind him creek, crossing very bad there.' ' Yes, take care, Mr. Vane,' rejoined the Captain. ' Keep your horse well in hand. Tambah is right ; the road is very indifferent in that locality.' ' All right, father,' exclaimed the elder boy, ' we will take care, we always do when crossing there ; don't be afraid.' The two lads wafted kisses towards their parents, the horse started off in a slow trot, and in a few minutes the vehicle passed out of sight. It was now nearly 11 o'clock. The sun had reached a high altitude, and the heat had become terribly intense. Not a breath of air moved the surrounding parched vegetation. A deathlike still ness pervaded the surroundings of Burraga run. The dogs lay panting in the shade, with their tongues hanging from their mouths. The cattle ceased browsing and sought for the shade of the trees ; and ' even the little birds discontinued their flitting and twittering. The Captain and his wife stood on the verandah of their dwelling watching the departure of the cart until it disappeared in the distant wind-' ings of the forest track ; they then cloBed the shut ters of the house, and retired to its inmost recesses, to avoid the increasing heat. CHAPTER H. The outstation of Burraga run was situated near Wattle Creek, about four miles distant from the . headstation. Some 4000 sheep were located there under the supervision of George Radcliffe, who had under his direction three shepherds,, two watchmen, . and a hutkeeper. The surrounding country con sisted of thinly -wooded forest, land and undulating flats. Bordering on the latter, in the southern part of the ran, were situated the Burraga Ranges, or . hills, at the foot of which flowed a continuation of Wattle Creek, which latter intersected between the head and outstations. Two slab huts, roofed with bark, a long shed built of the same materials, a watchman's box, and three enclosures surrounded with hurdles comprised the whole of the improve 

 ments and necessary buildings required at that time on the outstation. Seated oh a rude fixed bench at the door of one of the huts was a stalwart, although aged,:man of com manding stature. The ruddy glow on his bronzed features denoted health and strength ; long iron-grey locks descended from the cabbage tree hat which covered his head, and a luxuriant. beard of the same colour descended nearly to his waist. A fine sheep dog lay extended, and dozed at his feet ; while a heavy flint-lock gun was resting against the slabbed wall of the hut near to his hand. . The man seemed to be gazing intently and anxiously towards the ranges in front of him. Presently, approaching foot steps aroused him from his reverie; aud he fixed his eyes in the direction from whence, the sounds came. He had not long to wait until a man turned a bend in the pathway and came into sight, making his way quickly towards the hut. As he approached nearer, George Radcliffe � for it was he who had been sitting , at the door of the hut � took a few paces forward to, ' meet him. ' Hullo, Joe ! ' exclaimed the latter, ' so you have come back at last ; I was beginning to get anxious about you.' The person thus addressed was a dark-featured, powerfully-built man of 'middle height, possessing an abundance of coal-black hair and flowing beard. Across bis shoulders was slung a heavy flint-lock tower musket, and at his heels followed two splendid long-haired kangaroo dogs. The man appeared to be wearied and wellnigh exhausted by the intense heat. Believing himself of the heavy musket, he sat down on the seat just vacated, and, wiping the perspiration from his forehead, said, '- There was no occasion for alarm, Mr. Eadcliffe. I would have re turned sooner, but the terrible heat drove me to take a dip in the creek, which sent me to sleep, I should think, for more than an hour afterwards.' ' Well, come, let us go inside the hut,' returned Radcliffe. ' The sun would easily roast a bullock to-day ; and you must be hungry, Joe.' Joe was one of Captain Brabazon's assigned servants, A good and faithful servant he at various . times had proved himself to be, and was much appre ciated and trusted by his' master. His name was Joseph Cooper, but' he was better known on the station and in the surrounding district as ' Gipsy Joe.' ; Having entered the hut, both men seated them selves, and proceeded to fill and light their pipes ; aud, after Joe had taken a long draught of water, Eadcliffe asked, eagerly : ' ' Well, are they, there ?'- ' Yea ; there they are, sure enough,' -'replied Joe. ' The black rascals are in force jthifjjtime. There are more blacks camped in the ranges than the Tongois; some other tribe must have joined them. But, look here, Mr. Radcliffe, ., I Jdpg't think they mean mischief this time. They are barking the trees and figuring the ground. The women are away and' camped by themselves a good mile on the other side of the range ; besides which they have a good lot of food piled up as if ior a feast ; bo, from atl appear ances, I think they have come down to celebrate a Kebborah*, and, at least for the present, are not up to any other devilment.' , ' The devil may trust them � I won't,' replied Eadcliffe. ' It is likely some one will be over, from the head station this morning. I will then- send word to the master, and. request him to 6eud over two or three extra hands with muskets and more ammunition. The shepherds will have to be doubled and well armed, or else both the station and the sheep will be rushed, as sure as mv name is George Radcliffe.' * Just as the latter had- finished speaking the dog3, both inside and outside the hut, began to bark furiously. Joe rose from his seat, opened the door, and looked out. After quieting the dogs, he listened intently for a few seconds, and then, turning to his companion, said : � ', ? 'I think I hear the rumbling noise of a cart coming this way from the direction of the head station.' ' I shall be very glad',' exclaimed Radcliffe, as he joined Joe at the hut door. 'Perhaps it is the master himself ; but I can scarcely think that, be cause this is Christmas Day � which I had very nearly forgotten. I'm sure, unless he had great occasion, the master would not leave home to-day.' ' It is the springcart from the head station, sure enough,' said Joe, as the vehicle came in sight, winding along the track through the adjaeent forest, and making towards the hut, which it soon reached, and was pulled up at the door. ' Why, I do declare it's Mr. Vane and the two boys, God save them,' said Radcliffe, lifting bis hat reverently. ' ? When the cart came to a halt Bertie and Willie alighted, and, rushing up to 'Old George,' eaeh took him by a hand, exclaiming simultaneously : ' Father and mother wish you a happy Christmas, George, and so do we.' Tears sprang to the eyes of the old man' as he gazed with intense affection on the eager and beau tiful faces of the young lads. Releasing his hands from theirs he raised them above hfe head ahijl ex claimed with great fervour, ' May God bless and keep you all, is my earnest' prayer on this holy Christmas Day.' ' Mr. Vane, who had by this time joined the group, grasped the hand of the old man and shook it heartily; at the same tune addressing the hitter he said: ' You were fully expected to be at the head station to-day to eat your Christmas dinner. .Both the Captain and Mrs. Brabazon are much pained on account of your absence. The former desires me to say that he considers you are over-sensitive, and that your present fears concerning the blacks are only the product of a too vivid imagination.' ' . 'Well, Mr. Vane, maybe so,' replied Radcliffe, ' but I'm not going to leave this out station till I see or hear of thoseTjlack devils having cleared put of the ranges. But come inside for a while out of the burning sun, and take a rest and a drink of tea before you return home.'1,. , Joe took the horse from the cart to the shed. Mr. Vane, the two boys, and' Radcliffe .. entered the hut, taking with them the basket containing Old George's Christmas dinner. ? : ' Now, boys',' -said Vane, *' I can only allow you half an hour's rest, as you are aware of your father's injunction about our arriving home in time for dinner.' 'Very well, sir,' reply Bertie, 'we will start back in time.' Then, addressing the old man, he presented him with -the - basket, and said, ' Mother sends yon a Christmas dinner, and she wishes you many happy returns of the day, and is sorry that you should be absent.' ' Give my duty to your parents, God bless them, and tell them how happy I should have been to be with them to-day, but I feel that I have great cause to remain where I am. Your father seemingly makes light of it. Perhaps he is right; I hope and trust he may be. Give, them my thanks for the 'good cheer they have sent me; in return I send them my best wishes, hoping they may enjoy _a merry Christinas and a happy new year.' Saying which, Radcliffe relapsed into. a. moody silence, which con tinued for a minute or two, when Gipsy Joe made his reappearance at the door of the hut, beckoning the old man to come outside. The latter very soon re-entered the hut, and, calling Mr. Vane aside, said to him in a low tone, ' I have directed Joe to put the Iwrse to and bring the cart around, as I think you had better start for home at once. Those dreadful blacks have fired the grass near the foot of 

 the range. What little wind there is is from the* north ; the fire is not yet . likely to spread in y�ur direction ; it has only just started ; so as sow* as you get away I will take two or threw of the men with me and try to stamp it out before it gets much headway. Don't worry the Captain by saying a word about it, as I hope to stop the progress of the flames before they can do much damage.' Then, handing a letter to Mr. Vane, he continued : 'I wrote this early in the morning, please give it to the master, and say I would like to see hmi to-morrow if he san come over ; but, at any rate, ask him to despatch the men with arms and ammunition as soon as possible.' By this time the cart had reached near the hut ~door. The boys seemed to linger with the old man, as if loth to leave him, when the voice of Mr. Vane was heard summoning them to take their seats, as it was time to depart. The lads obeyed the sutoft&ons after several shakes of hands with ??SjOld George, 'and were in the act of starting when the latter called oat, ' Tell the master I should like him to send Tambabi out with the men ; I want him.' 'Yes; and Mr. Vane,' said Gipsy Joe, who had just left the horse's head, ' after you cross the creek keep well to your right.' 'Now then, Joe,' exclaimed Radcliffe as the cart was driven away, ' get two of the men, aud saddle your horses quickly ; I will get mine ; we must ride hard over to the ranges, and see if we can't put out that fire. Curses on those black devils, I'll be even with them yet, if 1 live, ' muttered the old man as he moved up towards the shed to get his horse. Great were the preparations at Burraga House for . the due celebration of Christmas Day. All hands on the head station were to assemble there to partake of the good cheer provided for them, as usual on such occasions, by their master and mistress, who spared neither trouble nor expense m order that they might confer happiness on those who were dependent on them, and share with them the festivities of the day. The storeroom had been cleared and prepared for the use of the men. A large table had been impro vised, and Btretched from wall to wall, and this fairly groaned with all the good things procurable in those primitive times. The dining-room within the house where the family were to congregate was pro fusely decorated with ferns, shrubs, and flowers. Here also the table was prepared ready for the advent of those who were to occupy seats around it. The Captain and his wife were busy in all directions, and, although the heat registered 96deg. in the shade, they seemed to be indefatigable in their efforts to make everything n suceess. Half -past noon had arrived. The employees on the station had commenced to assemble on the back verandah, where they were received and greeted bv their master and mistress in a kindly and unostentatious manner, when suddenly the aboriginal hid, Tambah, came running through the garden gate, and, almost breathless, reached the Captain's side. The letter looked for a moment inquiringly at him, when the lad hissed out from between his compressed lips, ' Make haste ! Fire ! Fire aU about bush!' Mrs. Brabazon turned pale, and her lips' trembled. The Captain for a second or two appeared as if he could not realise the situation, while the men around stood still as if waiting for their master's commands. At last the captain caught Tambah by the arm and quietly said to him : ' Cbme with me, and show me where.' On reaching the open space in front of the house immense volume of smokes were seen ascending to the sky in the direction of the Burraga ranges. 'The fire is evidently on this side of the creek,' said the Captain, ' and doubtless Radcliffe is attend ing to it ; but he will need h�lp ; some of you men must get away at once to assist him.' ' Look over there,' said one of the men, pointing to the opposite direction. 'There is another big fire commencing on the southern part of the run.' The Captain turned round and gazed, with dismay depicted on his countenance, towards the point in dicated ; and then, addressing his men in a firm tone of veice, said, 'My lads, things look ominous. We will have to postpone our Christmas dinner for a time, and endeavour to subdue that fire. The run has unmistakably been fired in two opposite direc tions. All our efforts must be concentrated towards preventing that fire in the southern part of the run from reaching the locality of tho headstation. Rad cliffe must seeds do the best he can with the con flagration near the ranges in the north. All of you procure axes, tomahawks, aud spades ; lose no time, but Drepare to start at once.' ' But, William,' said Mrs. Brabazon, who had at that moment joined the throng, ' should not Mr. Vane aud the boys have returned by this time ?' 'Yes; I had forgotten about the boys,' replied the Captain, taking his wife by the hand. ' Clara, dear, let me beg of you to go inside away from this terrible heat. I will rejoin you there in a minute or two.' Placing her hand ou his shoulder, Mrs. Brabazon, speaking in tremulous tones, said, ' William, dear, I can plainly see the fires are spreading in both directions. I feel anxious about the boys and Mr. Vane. Can they have left the outstation ?' Captain Brabazon averted his eyes for a second, and then replied to her assuringly : ' There is no oc casion for alarm ; Eadcliffe will take care that they will not leave the outstation in the face of any danger ; and I feel quite certain that Mr. Vane would not attempt to cross Wattle Creek if he saw fire raging in the bush in front of him. Therefore let me entreat of you to retire out of this furnace while I complete my arrangements with the men. I will follow you presently. Have no fear of the lads while Radcliffe is near them.' : Without uttering another word, Mrs. Brabazon receded towards the house, which she entered with bent head and clasped hands. The Captain followed her with his eyes until she disappeared within the doorway, then turning round somewhat abruptly he faced his men, and with a quivering voice asked who would volunteer to go to wards the outstation and Bee after the safety or ,, otherwise of the cart and its occupants. In response^ the men, as if in one accord, shouted ' I will. ? During these occurrences, which only occupied two or three minutes, Tambah stood by the side of the Captain ; not a movement or a sound escaped him. Putting his hand on the lad's shoulder, the former said to him, Tambah, my lad, will you go with one of the men and try to make the outstation, and see if all is right with Bertie and Willie and Mr. Vane ? ' The lad at first hung his head ; then raising his eyes they met those of the Captain, when Tambah replied in a low voice. ' S'pose you like, master, I go ; but no good ; you see fire come all about ; can't get to creek.' 'Tambah,' replied the Captain, emplfaticallv. '{what about Bertie and Willie?'^ * ' Him all right ; s'pose he no leave station and come across creek.' - ' 'Something must be done, and done quickly,' said the Captain, excitedly. ' Will you try to reach the outstation by going round the ranges'?' Tambah -was silent for a few moments. Then he said, 'Myall Koree* sit down there, and fire close up,' pointing to the dense columns of smoke rising near the ranges; 'but I go and try to get to old George. I want to see if Bertie and Willie all right,' ' Good lad,' said the Captain, apparently grati fied. ' I will send two of the men with you.' 'No, no,; I go mvself,' Tambah replied, with emphasis. 'S'pose Myall Koree sit down there; whitefellow make too much noise ; then blackfellow kfllhunalL' 'But I will arm the men and yourself with muskets; then you need not fear.' Tambah shook his head, and said determinedly 

 ' No� master, I go myself ; you tell missis no cry ; t go look for Willie abd I come back to-night ; you Watch him fire ; I no think it come close Up house : plenty rain come along soon. Gtrod-bye, master, I gOi'' Saying which, he started off at a tapid pace across the paddock, and in a few minutes disappeared in the bush beyond-. ' jfow, my lads,'* said Captain Brabazon, address ing his tneh; ' we inust go and meet this fire, aud tenaeavour, if possible, to beat it hack before it rSaches the fences. Take five minutes to prepare yourselves, then return here and follow me.' The men hurried off to their huts as directed, but the Captain remained for a few moments steadfastly gazing in the direction of the fire, now increasing in volume at the northern part of the run. Then with a despondent shake of his head be again entered the house. His wife met him near the entrance, and with extended arms stepped forward a few' paces towards him, exclaiming, in piteous accents, 'Oh, William, dear, our boys, our boys.'* The Captain at first appeared to be a little de jected, but soon recovering himself he took his wife's two hands in his, and said to her soothingly, ' There is no occasion for alarm ; it is not yet 1 o'clock. The boys may have got through before the fire reached the track, or even before its commencement ; if bo, they may arrive at any moment. But you may de pend upon it if Eadcliffe foresaw the slightest danger he would most assuredly detain them at the out station. Tambah, at my request, has gone round by the ranges to try to reach the place ; doubtless he will return before night sets in, or, what would be better, the boys may have arrived home prior to his return ' Leading his wife to a seat, he continued, ' I implore you to be calm and do not worry your self ; keep inside the house away from the intolerable heat of the sun, accelerated as it is by the surround ing bush fires. I am now going with the men to Long Flat to endeavour to arrest the progress of the fire at that point, and so prevent it from devastat ing the head station, and with God's help we hope to be successful.' After again impressing upon his wife the necessity of calmness and confidence in Providence, the Cap tain hastily retired to prepare himself for the coining struggle. Two or three minutes sufficed for him to complete his preparations, and then he rejoined his men, who were ready and waiting outside for his reappearance. All the station hands were collected, and each man earned either a spade, axe, or a toma hawk ; all were dressed alike, wearing trousers and shirts only, the sleeves of the latter turned up to the shoulders. Determination and resolution seemed to predominate in every man as they passed through the sliprails of the paddock, led by their master, to do battle with the all-devouring element. The heat had now become more intense. A light breeze sprang up from the north, but even that was hot. The sun assumed a coppery hue, and a dense haee overspread the heavens. The fire over against the ranges in the southern part of the run appeared to be extending and gaining strength, but the north wind would keep that from approach ing the head station. It was the now-raging fire in the north from which most danger was to be appre hended. If the wind increased ever so little, great exertions would have to be made to keep that' fire back and prevent it from making headway across Long Flat, which was situated scarcely more than a quarter of a mile from Burraga House. Captain Brabazon, being fully aware of the position, led his men onward in that direction. CHAPTER HI. George Eadcliffe and his three companions at the Btation had mounted their horses, and were just about to' make a start for the ranges, where the fire was seen by them to be fast assuming a . very threatening appearance, when a cry of warn ing escaped from Gipsy Joe and arrested the attention of the others. ' My goodness,'he exclaimed, 'look over yonder,' pointing with his upraised finger towards the northern portion of the run. Badcliffe quickly turned liis horse round, and gazed with dismay depicted on his face in the direc tion indicated by Joe, and there beheld even a greater conflagration than the one raging in the opposite quarter. For a few moments the old man gazed in silence, and for a time seemed like one bewil dered ; but he soon regained his consciousness. With perspiration teeming from his forehead, he stretched forth his hand towards the north, pointing to the new and greater danger. Then he exclaimed' with a loud voice : ' Boys, it's no use for us to go over to the ranges ; the wind will keep that fire back, or it must be left to burn itself out. The greater danger now lies in an opposite direction. If that fire in the north gains headway, God help the head station ;' and then, as if a sudden thought had struck him, he pressed his hand across his eyes as if to shut out a vision, and con tinue in a broken tone of voice, ' Yes, and may God also help thoBe poor boys if they have crossed Wattle Creek.' With a sudden impulse he drove his spurs into the flanks of his horse, which started forward, and then raising his hand upward he Bhouted, 'Come on, lads, follow me ; let us make for the crossing at the creek first.' Wattle Creek was distant from the outstation a little under a mile. The -banks of the creek were somewhat steep, and its bed was rocky and uneven at the crossing, where at this time the water was scarcely 18in. deep. But in times of flood it became a raging torrent. At any period it was a difficult task to drive a vehicle over it safely. Badcliffe and his men were not long before they reached the cross ing place. The former at once dismounted from his horse, and proceeded down the bank of the creek, doselyexaminingthegroundashedescended. When he reached the bottom he made a full stop, and seemed to be carefully examining the track. After which he hastily retraced his steps up to the bank, exclaiming as he went along, ' They have turned back and recrossed the creek ; it is evident that they must have taken the old track to the falls near the ranges, hoping to cross the creek there, so as to avoid in time the approaching fire from the north. Let us follow their tracks at once,' continued, Badcliffe as he hastly remounted his horse, and then he and his men briskly trotted off along the bank of the creek, following the track of the cart in the direction of the ranges. They rode along in silence for a few minutes, when Badcliffe beckoned Gipsy Joe to his 6ideandsaidtohim, ' Mr. Vane did right to re turn across the creek, but, instead of going by the way of the falls, what a pity it is he did not come back to the station.' *' Yes,' replied Joe, ' but I'm afraid it's out of the frying-pan into the fire all the same. If they manage to crossover those ugly falls safely, and_ the wind changes to the south� which I think it will � now are they going to escape the fire at the ranges ? And. then they may come across the infernal Tongoi blacks.' 'The devil take the imps,'* said Badcliffe; 'at any rate this fire may do some good if the north wind freshens ; it will drive the blacks out of the ranges.' ' Only to move to some other part of the run, and perhaps make more mischief,' replied Joe. 'But let us get along, Mr. Eadcliffe ; look at those heavy clouds rising in the south-west. We. shall have a heavy storm before the sun goes down, you may depend upon it.' They had by this time reached within half a mile of the falls, and, taking the hint from Joe, put their horses into a canter. A few minutes later the cross ing place was sighted, when, Badcliffe, who was lead ing, pulled up short and held his hand aloft signing 

 for the others to halt* 'What is that'r' he exclaimed, pointing to an object which appeared in the opening a short distance in his front ; ' surely it is the cart. Joe, shading his eyes with his hand, replied, ' Yes, it'B the cart sure enough : but I don't see a living Boul in it ; and the hoise is not there. What can be up?' ' This is strange,' Radcliffe muttered. ' Come on, lads, and let us see what's the matter*' In another minute the whole party arrived close to the vehicle, when to their astonishment they dis covered it to be upside down, with portions of the harness still attached to the shafts* The men sur veyed the scene in du.nb amafcernent for a few moments, when something like a faint groan met their ears. With one accord they instantly dis mounted, and Gipsy Joe walked round to the other side of the cart. On arriving there au exclamation of horror escaped him, and he called out loudly, ' Come here.' Eadcliffe, with the others, immediately joined him, when they beheld the two legs of a man protruding from beneath the upturned cart To right the vehicle was but the work of a moment, when to their horror they discovered the apparently lifeless body of Mr. Vane. ' Gracious heaven 1 what has become of the boys?' exclaimed Badcliffe, as he knelt down by the side of the prostrate man, and gently raised his head. '? He breathes ; he is not dead. Quick, Joe; get the flask out of my valise.' The flask was soon forthcoming, and gently pressed between the lips of the unconscious man, when a faint sigh escaped from him. ' Take care of what you are about,' said one of the men, ' I think both his legs are broken.' '* This is a dreadful business ; what are we to do ? ' said Eadcliffe, in a hushed voice. At that moment Gipsy Joe, who was reclining against the cart, called out, ' Look, there is the h�rse*� It was the horse, sure enough, with the collar still on his neck and other portions of the harness hanging about him. He was quickly captured and found to be uninjured ; but some parts of the harness were wrenched and broken. 'Well.' said Joe, 'this is the strangest piece of business I ever heard of. There is not the sign of a stone, stump, or rut hereabouts. I can't make it' out.' Radcliffe was most assiduous in his attentions to the sufferer, whose face was much disfigured with blood. On closer examination, a wound was dis covered near the crown of his head, from which it was evident that blood had flowed freely, as the upper portions of his clothing- were fairly saturated with it. Water was procured from the adjacent creek in one of the men's hats and gently applied to the wounded man's face and heaa, which after a time seemed to partially revive him. A lew more drops of brandy from the flask, carefully administered by Badcliffe, produced another long, deep-drawn sigh and a slight movement of his right arm. He was then held up m a half sitting posture, and Badcliffe, placing his lips close to the sufferer's ear, said softly, 'Mr. Vane, Mr. Vane, can you speak? I am George Eadcliffe.' Vane turned his half -opened eyes on his questioner, and, after a short pause and with apparent difficulty, he gasped out the 'word ' Blacks.' Then he closed his eyes and sank back again into the arms of Rad cliffe, relapsing into his previous state of insensi bility. 'Just what I thought,' exclaimed the latter; ' this is the work of those wretches. But the boys ? What can they have done with those poor boys ? Here, Joe, fix up that harness in the best way you can, and put the horse to at once ; and all of you spare your coats and spread them in the cait. Here is mine to begin with,' and, suiting the action to the word, he took off his coat and threw it over to the men. Joe managed somehow to fix up the broken harness, aud then the horse was put between the shafts. The coats and some dried grass were im provised as a bed whereon the unconscious man was laid in the bottom of the cart. When all pre liminaries were completed, Radcliffe said, ' I will drive this poor fellow to the outstation ; and here, Jones,' addressing one of the men, 'take mj horse. You know he is a good one, and ride as if for your life over to Eurimba. It is but little more than 12 miles. The horse will carry you there under the hour, and you have nothing to fear from the fire, as you will /be travelling away from it. Tell Dr. Floyd all that has happened ; don't delay, but come back to the outstation with him. Now, my lad, mount quickly and don't let the grass grow under the horse's feet.' Jones obeved the command with alacrity, and was soon lost toView on his way to Eurimba. All being ready for a start, Eadcliffe took the reins in his hand and mounted the cart ; then addressing his followers he said, ' I can onlv travel slowly with this poor' fellow ; all of you keep with the cart for fear of accident. When we arrive at the outstation, and have removed him into my hut, I mean to try to make for the head station. If the fire by that time has not reached Long Flat I may get there by fol lowing the creek down on its left bank ; at any rate whatever happenB I mean to try. If I succeed in getting there, how to meet the master and mistress I don't know ; but see the Captain I must. In the meantime God only knows the fate of those two lads.' Taking his seat in front of the cart, George Bad cliffe moved slowly forward, depressed and dejected, towards bis destination. As the sun dipped towards the western horizon, heavy and ominous-looking clouds appeared as if tumbling over each other in the southern sky. The rumbling of distant thunder came nearer and nearer as the afternoon commenced to wane. ' The heat of the day continued in its in tensity, and all appearances betokened the advent of one of those violent storms so prevalent in Australia after the close of a hot midsummer day. The afternoon had far advanced when the cart, with its almost lifeless occupant, reached the hut at the outstation. The patient was carefully removed, and placed on Badchffe's bed. This accomplished, and, after giving the men a few further directions, the hitter mounted one of the horses and rode away briskly in the direction of Wattle Creek, on his somewhat hazardous journey to Burraga head sta tion. Long Flat, appropriately so named, was a tree less piece of country extending east and west for more than a mile. In width it scarcely exceeded 200 yards, but it was prof usely covered with grass and stunted shrubs. For several weeks past no rain had fallen, consequently the vegetation had become dry and scorched by the fierceness of the summer sun,renderingithighlyinnammableand easQyignited. It was in this locality that Gaptain Brabazon deter mined to exert all his energy and resources in en deavouring to Buppress 'the fire which . was fast approaching towards; the head station in the north. It was quite apparent that if the wind con tinued in the same quarter, the devastating flames would ultimately spread over Long Flat. In that event certain destruction awaited all the buildings and fences surrounding Burraga. When the Captain and his men- arrived at the flat, the fire f ortunately'had not yet reached it, but the distant roaring of the flames amongst the trees and undergrowths in the adjacent forest could be dis tinctly heard. The men had cut down and provided themselves with great green boughs of trees to be used as beaters. Armed with these, they stood at distances from each other, distributed all along the border of Long Flat, where it joined the forest on the northern side, fully prepared to meet the 

 advancing ioe. To the great dismay of all, the wind shifted a point or two westward and increased in strength. The fire now began to rage with greater fierceness, and had reached to within about 150 yards of the flat. The heat became more intense, notwithstanding tha't the sun was shrouded in a dense haee and huge volumes of smoke filled the air. On. on; came the devouring element ; and as it approached nearer it seemed as if Pandemonium had broken loose. Droves of kangaroos and other marsupials rushed out from the burning forest and across the flat, quite heedless of the presence of their human enemies. Ravenous dingoes, side by side with wallabies and emus, scampered madly over the open 6pace into the bush beyond for dear life. Cockatoos and parrots of various species screamed and shrieked in chorus as they flew in mixed disorder through the smoke-laden atmosphere. Snakes, lizards, iguanas, and other reptiles wriggled and crawled through the scorched brown glass to evade the near approach of the remorseless flames. The sun, nearing the western horizon, had assumed the appearance of a great blood -red ball. Huge black clouds,, with indented summits, were apparently toppling over each other in their wild race for alti-- tude in the southern sky. The continued rumbling noise of distant thunder each moment became more distinct. All the surroundings seemed wild, terrible, and uuhearthly. Iu the midst of all this there stood Captain Brabazon and his dozen men with immense green boughs in their hands, fearless and undaunted, and prepared to cope with the raging element, which with increasing fury was now close upon them. The crashing of falling trees was by this time dis tinctly heard. Huge burning limbs fell to the ground with rebounding thuds. The green leaves crackled as each succeeding tongue of flame devoured them, while great sparks of fire and small figments of burning bark, driven through the air by the now increasing wind, oommenced to fall near the feet of the men, who stood their ground like stoics, undismayed, and determined, as with their great green boughs they battled with and resisted the van guard of their enemy. , The fire had now ap proached to within 50 yards of the flat, and to all appearances was burning more fiercely than ever. The task of the men seemed hopeless. What could they effect against that tremendous mass of fire with only those few green boughs to aid them '( The Cap tain was no idle looker-on. Although the heat was terrific and the perspiration teemed down his smoke stained face, he worked with almost superhuman energy, at the same time cheering on his men with words of praise and encouragement. Nevertheless ? he knew full well that the crisis was near at hand. Flakes of fire commenced to fall in small showers on the extreme end of the flat, and in several places ignited the inflammable dry grass. These small ignitions were soon beaten down ; but it was quite evident that if the great body of flame once reached the opening nothing available could stay its progress, and then the head station would be doomed. Captain Brabazon was aware of all this, and the knowledge of it seemed to endow him with greater energy to keep the fire in check and increase his endeavours to prevent it crossing Long Flat. The sun was now disappearing below the horizon. The north wind had suddenly ceased, and inter mittent puffs came from the west ; vivid flashes of lightning quickly succeeded each other in the southern sky. The claps of thunder came nearer, louder, and more continuous. Great drops of rain began to fall at intervals. Everything denoted the near advent of a violent storm, such as invariably relieves the atmosphere after two or three days of abnormal summer heat. As the last rays of the setting sun disappeared in the west, and without further warning, the ' southerly buster,' in all its fury, came along. The devastating flames were driven back into the desolate waste they had already created. The progress of the fire northward wa6 providentially arrested, and Burraga headstation was saved from destruction and ruin. The men, worn out and tired, at once desisted from their labour and gathered in a group round their equally fatigued master, v ho openly expressed his gratification and thanks for their devoted and un - ceasing exertions. The rain commenced to fall in torrents, forked lightning pierced the heavens in every direction, peal succeeded peal of thunder, which rattled overhead m one continued roar. In the midst of these truly awful surroundings, which began to fill the men with awe, Captain Brabazon bared his head, when his lips moved in silent prayer of thanks offered to the Giver of all Good for His latest mercies. 'And now, my lads,' he continued, ' thank God all immediate danger is past, so far as the fire is concerned; therefore, let us hasten towards home before the storm increases, for increase it cer tainly will, and I am anxious about my sons, who had not reached the station previous to our depar ture from it. Perhaps the troubles of this direful Christmas day are not yet completed for me and mine.' - While he spoke the violence of the storm increased. The southerly commenced to howl and whistle among the trees. The lightning became, if possible, more vivid and bunding. The thunder never ceased in its deafening and crashing explosions ; while the ram, driven along in sheets by the increasing force of the wind, completed an awful picture of the coming night. The men, following the lead of their master, soon passed across the flat aud entered the forest beyond on their way home. It was nearly 8 o'clock on that wild summer evening when the Captain and his fol lowers passed through the sliprails of Burraga pad dock. ' On reaching the house the men, ,who were wet and weary, partook of refreshment, which they sadly needed, and then gladly retired to their quarters. Mrs. Brabazon, in a state of intense anxiety, met her husband as he entered the house and fell fainting on his breast without uttering a word. With the aid of her female servants she was removed into the dining-room, which, as if in mockery of the dread events of the day, remained gaily bedecked with beautiful flowers and shrubs. The table was still spread in readiness to receive the Christmas dinner. ,But no joyous sounds of greeting coming from the lips of his almost idolised boys met the ears of the careworn and anxious father. After a few minutes of painful suspense, Mrs. Brabazon recovered from her swoon, ana when her eyes encountered those of her husband, her lips quivered, but she failed to speak. The Captain, deeply affected, turned to one of the girls and in a hushed voice said, ' ' Jane, tell me has anything been heard of the boys ?' The girl shook her head mournfully in the nega tive, but made no reply . -. ' He then sat down by the side of bis wife and drew her near him, saying, ' Now, Clara, listen for a moment to me. This has been a most dreadful day, instead of being a day of joy and happiness, as we had every reason to anticipate it would be. Yet we must, with great humility, say ' God's will be done.' That the boys, with Mr. Vane, are safe at the outstation I entertain no manner of doubt. Ead cliffe would never suffer them to depart while those fires were raging around. But hark to the rain, it is falling in torrents ! The fires will soon be quenched, and then depend upon it it will not be long before we hear from ' Old George.' We could not expect the lads to come home on such a night as this, and through the yet smouldering fires.' Suddenly the Captain paused as if a passing thought had struck him, and, turning to Jane, he hurriedly asked, 'Has Tambah come back yet ? ' The girl replied in the negative, when Mrs. Bra bazon hastily rose from her recumbent position and, 

 placing her hands on her husband's bhoulders, ex claimed, ' Your words have entered my heart and filled it with hope, and I feel, with God's help, our darling boys are safe.' The Captain was not long in effecting a change of his sodden clothes, and was continuing to reassure his wife when the sounds of horses' hoofs met his ears coming towards the house. Both listened atten tively for a few moments, when he quietly moved to the front door and passed out on to the verandah. The horseman, whoever he was, evidently knew the locale of the dwelling and its surroundings, for in stead of halting at the door of the house he continued onward towards the stable. The Captain gave a low whistle, when the traveller instantly pulled up. ' Who is that r' demanded the Captain. ' It is I, George Radcliffe,' returned the latter. ' Is that you, Captain Brabazon ?' ' Yes,' he replied softly, *' but go on to the stable ; don't stop here ; I will follow you.' 'AU right, sir,' BadclifFe responded, and con tinued on his way. The Captain, reassuring his wife, hastily swallowed a little refreshment and donned his greatcoat, for the rain was still coming down heavily. He then hastened to join Eadcliffe in the stable. Entering, lantern in hand, and raising the light to his face, the Captain exclaimed, ' Gracious heaven, George, you have the appearance of a ghost. But you have ridden through this great storm and must be wet to the skin. Here, drink some of this. Producing a flask from his pocket, he handed it to the drenched man, who with a trembling hand lifted it to his lips and partook of some of its contents. Captain Brabazou gazed fixedly on the man's face for a few moments, then placing his hand on the other's shoulder, said with uncon trolled emotion, ' Speak, George, or 1 shall lose my senses ; for God's sake where are my boys ? ' A deep sigh involuntarily escaped from the old man as he replied : 'Be calm, master, all may yet be well. I have much to say to you ; but it must not be said here. Your absence from the house will surely raise suspicion in the mind of the mistress. Let us go down away from here.' ' I believe you are right. I must not remain any longer ; but Mrs. Brabazon should not see you to night at least. You know the storeroom well. The men's Christmas dinner remams there untouched on the table. 'Sou must surely need refreshment. I will at once bring you a change of clothes, and when all is quiet I will rejoin you and listen to what you have to tell me. But one thing I must learn at once: Did Mr. Vane and the boys attempt to return home by the wav of the northern fire?* ' Thev did not,' replied the old man. ' Thank God for that ! ' fervently ejaculated the Captain. 'Now let us go. ' CHAPTEE IV. When Tambah departed from the headstation on that eventful forenoon, he took a direct route towards Burraga ranges. On arriving near that locality his instinct taught him to be watchful and cautious, for he well knew that if he were to fall into the hands of the Tongoi tribe of blacks, who were supposed to be camped there, his life would inevitably pay the penalty, a deadly feud having existed for sonie time past between the former and the_ tribe to which he belonged. Therefore it behoved him to keep on the alert while he continued in the vicinity of the ranges. Stripping off his clothes, he carefully hid them beneath some thick shrubbery ; then in a nude condition he slowly pursued his way through the thick and darkened forest which led towards the falls. The fire in this direction was as yet slowly but surely making headway : but it had not reached within a quarter of a mile from the foot of the range, and Tambah hoped ' to escape it altogether before he reached the crossing at the falls, safely passing over which he felt he would have no further difficulty while making for the outstation. He successfully evaded the fire, and had approached to within 200 or 300 yards of the crossing when, with a startled look, he halted, cast ing troubled and anxious glances around him. His lips quivered ; his nostrils visibly expanded ; and he sank quietly down into the long rank grass at his side. From some hidden cause the lad seemed to be forewarned of impending danger ; but what could it be ? Not a sound was heard ; nothing disturbed the peacefulness of the surrounding bush, except the twittering of small birds and the occasional chattering of parrots perched on the neighbouring trees. It was evident that some mysterious and unaccountable instinct had' developed itself in the lad, and had made him aware of danger lurking near. For several minutes he lay concealed in the long waving grass. Not a muscle . did he move, and even his breathing seemed to have ceased ; but presently, as he lay flat on the ground, he stretched forth one of his hands and cautiously dislodged a few tufts of grasB. With these he covered his head, and then gently raised it a few inches above the ground and listened intently. He had scarcely time to resume his former position be fore the tramping of many feet became quite dis tinct ; and then there passed within 50 yards of him some 20 or 30 blacks in all the hideousness of their warpaint, and fully armed with spears, shields, and nulla nullas.* The blacks moved quickly along in the direction of the falls, and their footsteps soon died away in the distance. Then Tambah slowly rose up from his hiding place and stood erect, his glistening eyes, peering into the gloom beyond, as if to discover what was the object sought to be attained by the hated foes of his tribe. For a few seconds he appeared to be irresolute ; then, apparently having decided in his mind the course he would pursue, he took up and followed the trail of the Tongois, for such he now knew them to be. On nearing the falls Tambah repeatedly stopped to listen. But as yet allwas silent. Nothing denoted the whereabouts of the Tongoi warriors or the ob ject on which they were bent. He had now reached to within 50 yards of the crossing, when, with all the agility- 6f his race, he quickly clambered up into the fork of a tall gum tree, and . concealed himself amongst its branches, from whence he obtained a good view of the creek and the crossing of the falls. There were no signs of the blacks, and he was wondering at their disappearance, when, in the distance, on the other side of the creek, he saw the cart he was in quest of coming at a brisk pape towards the crossing. Tambah at once foresaw tbe danger his friends were rushing into ; but he was powerless to prevent it. He knew that the Tongois must be somewhere near at hand, and he trembled for the fate of Mr. Vane and the boys. ? The cart approached near to the falls and then stopped. Mr. Vane alighted, and had just taken the horse by the head to lead him down the somewhat precipitous bank of the creek, when a wild demonia cal yell echoed and re-echoed through the surround ing bills, and the whole body of blacks rushed out from their .place of concealment near the falls, and made for the vehicle. Mr. Vane received their first onslaught. A blow from a nulla felled him to the ground. The two boys were dragged screaming from the cart, while the horse, maddened with fright, reared violently and broke the harness,, free ing himself and galloping off. Some of the - blacks then threw the vehicle over and across the prostrate body of Mr. Vane. Others, seizing the two boys, carried them forcibly away towards the eastern divi sion of the ranges. Tambah was an unwilling wit ness of the outrage. A reciprocal and strong affec tion existed between the kidnapped lads and himself, yet he was powerless to afford then aid; but he men tally cursed the Tongois and threatened them with .the vengeance of his tribe. He remained con cealed in the midst of the foliage of the tree 

 for some minutes after the departure of the marauders and their captives. Then he slowly de scended, aad_ proceeded cautiously towards the crossing at the falls. Arriving there, hef knelt 'down and drank copiously from the stream, then rose and crossed the creek, and at once turned his steps in the direction of the overturned cart. On arriving close to it, he beheld the. tiro legs of Mr. Vane protruding .' from its side, and at onde' endeavoured' ^to raise the ' vehicle, but the attempt, was vain. His strength was of no avail ; he could not move it an inch. Shaking his head deprecatingly, and believing the man to be dead, he turned to depart,', but something near attracted his attention. -.Taking a few paceB forward, he discovered one of the poor boys' hats. Taking it in hus hand, he looked at it intently for a few seconds, then, dashing it from him, he seemed to take a sudden resolution. Picking up the trail of tbe departed blacks, he followed* it,' onward, leading towards the adjacent, hills.; evidently bent upon some, project hastily conceived In. his mind. The sun was nearly setting when Tambah passed over the eastern end of the ranges, shortly after which the mnharra* came in sight. The beehive - shaped gunyas were scattered on the western slopes of the bills, aud when they came into full view the lad stood still for a few minutes intently surveying the situation. Presently he seemed to have resolved upon a course ' of action. The storm was coining on apace ; the surrounding atmosphere was laden with smoke. The continued rum bling of distant thunder, combined with the threatening aspect of the south-western sky, denoted the near approach of a wild, stormy night. Tambah cast furtive glances around the locality. He knew well what he would have to encounter from the elements. But for them he seemed to care nothing in comparison with what he had to fear from the wily enemy in front. The sun had now begun to disappear beneath the horizon. 1 he appearance of the heavens became more threaten ing, aud the storm appeared about to burst in all its fury, when the lad slowly departed from the position he had occupied, and weuded his way by taking a ' circuitous route towards the encampment. Semi-darkness now pre vailed, and between the almost continuous and vivid flashes of lightning Tambah, from his vantage ground, could see the occupants of the camp, both male and female, busily engaged in securing the bark around their frail gunyas in order if possible to save them from the effects of the fast approaching tornado. He now proceeded cautiously along the face of the hill, gliding from tree to tree to avoid observation. When he at last approached to within about 150 yards of the camp, crouching down intherearof a large clump of undergrowth, two or three successive flashes of lightning revealed to his sight a huge fallen tree. This proving to be hollow, he quieJdycrawled into it, to bide events and as a protection from the then raging storm. Midnight arrived and the great violence of the storm had abated : but still the south wind howled and whistled at intervals among3t the trees ; the rain continued to fall in intermittent showers. The Tongoi blacks slept soundly in and around their frail huts or gunyas, where fires burned near the front opening of each � a few burning brightly, but most of them smoulder ing in their ashes. Nature appeared to be hushed as if exhausted after the violence of the storm. Not a sound was to. be heard, save the mournful wail of the curlew or the occasional dismal hoot of the niorpokf relieving the gravelike monotony of tbe night. In one of the gunyas near the centre of the camp, folded in each other's arms, sat the two boys, Bertie aud Willie. No sleep had dimmed their eyes that night. Their tearstained cheeks were pressed against each other as they sat on the ground gazing as if in a kind of stupor at the fire, now and then flickering in front of the wide opening of the hut, across which, as if to prevent ingress or egress, lay the sleeping bodies of two old gins,** into whose custody the boys had been disposed of for the night. Suddenly a violent gust of wind whistled past aud caused thp frail edifice to tremble, at the same time causing a smull flame to arise out of the dying embers of the fire. At that moment a human form rose stealthily from behind the sleeping gins. Like a spectre it seemed to assume shape as it noiselessly ascended as if from out of the ground. It was Tam bah. With one hand he pointed towards the gins at his feet, and the other he held across his mouth, evi- . deutly enjoining silence. At first the boy6 exhibited fear, but as the flame flickered slowly upwards from the fire the elder boy's face appeared to brighten. He had recognised his friend, aud, with rare intelli gence in one so young, he neither moved nor did he utter a souud. Tambah, by signs, directed them to takeoff their' boots'an�l'inove to the back '6i the gunya. Bsrtie whispered -softly to his brother, aud then, in response to the signals made to them, the two boys silently obeyed the command. Without disturbing �yen a blade of grass, Tambah resumed his prostrate position on the ground, and slid gently froin-Jhfe frout of the hut, the back of which the boys had reached without disturbing or attracting the attention of the snoring gius.' Iu less than a minute, without the slightest sound being heard, a few frag ments of the soft flimsy titree bark of which the gunya was composed were carefully arid silently re moved f roiri its' back part. Through the aperture thus made the head and shoulders of Tambah appeared! Agaiu by signs, he motioned to Bertie to sit still while he lifted the youuger boy through the aperture he had made. Carrying him in hi6 arms, he dis appeared in the adjoining bush. Two or three minutes elapsod before he returned, and then he successfully removed the elder boy, thus completing his dangerous task without disturbing one of the ferocious denizens of the camp. Having regained the place where he had left Willie, he lifted him across his shoulders, and taking Bertie by the hand, without either of them giving utterance to a word, proceeded slowly and sileutly towards Burraga Ranges. Not a 'word passed between them- until half -a mile was placed between them and the muharra, when Tambah stopped aud relieved him t-elf of his burden. ? ? : Both the children were still' terribly scared. They imagined that tbe Tougois would soon dis cover their flight and pursue them. But Turabah reassured the lads by telling them that nothing whatever would induce the blacks to move out of their camp uutil daylight appeared, when he hoped they would be beyond their reach' on the other side of the falls, and well on their v.-i.y home. Theu taking the boys by the baud on either side of him, they all three moved forward on theu1 way to the crossmg at the falls. CHAPTER V. Doctor Floyd had retired from service in the Royal Navy some three years previously, and, like Jus - neighbour, Captain TJrabazon, had settled down in the wilds of Australia as a pastoralist. His station, known as Eurinda, was situated about 16 miles west from Burraga head station, and 12 miles distant from the outstation. The Doctor did not, as a rule, practise his profession : but if any serious disease cr in shap afflicted his neighbours � who at the time were lew and far between� his services were always available. Being a bachelor, his domestic surround ings were very unpretentious ; and as his habits were of a retiring nature, bis visitors and his visits were comparatively limited. Seated on the verandah of his slabbed cottage, on that hot and memorable Christmas afternoon, his attention was suddenly 

 drawn from a book he was reading to a horseman riding hard towards the sliprails of the paddock fronting his residence: Doctor Floyd rose from his , seat, .and, assuming a look of impatience, waited the arrival of his unexpected visitor, who shortly after pulled up his panting and foam -covered horse close to where the Doctor was standing. Tbe man appeared to be .nearly exhausted from tbe effects of intense - heat and over-exertion. ' Well, myiuan,' said theforroer.ina kindly tone, 'what's the matter; but, before you tell me, take your unfortunate horse round tn the stable, and let the groom attend to him, for to all appearances he sorely needs it.' Jones, the messenger despatched by Radcliffe, respectfully lifted his hat, and did as he was directed. In a few minutes he returned and related to the Doctor the substance of his mission, and gave him full details of the melancholy occurrence at the falls. The hitter listened calmly to all the man had to communicate, and theu said to him : ' This is a sad business, my man. I will prepare at once to return with you. In'the meantime go round to the kitchen and get some refreshment. How long has it taken you to come from the outstation r'1 'About -an hour, sir,' replied Jones. ' Twelve miles an hour on such a day as this. We must change horses for you. That poor animal is quite unfit to carry you back.' In legs than half an hour from thetime of Jones's arrival at Euriuda, everything was ready for their departure ; and shortly after they were cantering briskly towards Burraga outstation. Arriving there, the doctor was soon in attendance on the suf ferer, who by this time had regained a kind of dazed consciousness. After a direful examination of the patient, he was pronounced to have suffered a fracture of one of his legs, while the other was badly bruised, and the blow from the nulla had caused a severe depression of the skull. Dr. Floyd having done all that was possible for the present to relieve the wounded man, expressed his determination at all hazards to proceed to Burraga heaastatiou, notwithstanding that the storm had just commenced to rage furiously in the vicinity of the hut. He felt that his presence might be urgently required there, aud he felt doubly anxious regarding the fate of the two boys, to whom he was much attached. Gipsy Joe, who was to accompany the Doctor over to the head station, shook his head denrecatingly, and urged the latter to remain where hewas untilthe storm abated and sufficient time had been allowed for tbe torrents of rain to quench the still burning fires, at the same time expressing his concern for the fate of Radcliffe, who had only de parted for tbe headstation a few minutes prior to the arrival of the Doctor and Jones at the hut. After further exhortation on the part of Joe the former consented to wait until the violence of the storm had somewhat subsided. In the meantime Mr. Vane, 'appeared to be dozing intermittently but calmly, and Doctor Floyd expressed hopes of his ultimate recovery. Shortly after midnight the storm commenced to abate, and, as the early morning wore on, the hitherto heavy showers of rain entirely ceased ; the dark, threatening clouds slowly dispersed ; the stars once moire began to reveal their brightness in the heavens; and all nature, as if exhausted by the violence of itsjate functions, seemed to be relaxing into a state of tired repose. The lights wore still viFible in Burraga House. Kpne of the ininates of that dwelling had partaken of sleep during the preceding night. All there was confusion aud dismay. The men stood around the verandah iu knots of twos aud threes, and communed with each other in hushed voices, while threats of vengeance were launched unsparingly against the Tougoi blacks. 'Jane says the Captain is nigh mad, aud the missis keeps going out of one faint into another,' said one of the men, addressing another. l- Yes,' replied the other, '* but they say that both of them are easier now since the arrival of Dr. Floyd. Gipsy Joe.is a wonder. He brought the Doctor over when nobody expected him ; but I'm afraid he can't do much good unless he can restore the poor boys to their mother.' Inside the house the dining-room was still bedecked with green bushes and flaunting flowers. The table was spread in readiness to receive the Christmas dinner, iu seeming mockery- of the surrounding woe. Captain Brabajjon, with his head bowed down iu silent grief, sat near one of the windows. His wife, with a face as white and as rigid as marble, recliued on a coudi, apparently in a state of stupor. George Radcliffe completed the scene by standing near the door with contracted brows, eagerly waiting for the coming daylight to break through the eastern sky, when it was determined that he, accompanied by the X5aptain and a party of .armed men, should scour the., ranges in search of the marauding blacks and the kidnapped boys. Dr. Floyd signed to Jane, who had just entered the room, to take his place by the side of- the afflicted mother. Theu he passed across . the room to where the Captain sat, and placing his hands on the shoulders of the latter, esc'.aimed iu a low voice : ' Come. Brabazon, this will never do ; ro.U6e your self from this lethargy. The day- is near breaking, and it is time we should concert measures for the pursuit of these villainous blacks aud the recovery of the boys.' The Captain slowly raised his head, his pale, haggard face betraying the intensity of his suffering. Casting a pitiful glance across the room to where the form of his almost unconscious wife was reclin ing, he replied with a stifled sob, and in a broken voice, ' Yes, Doctor, I will try ; but where is Radcliffe? I desire to speak with him.' The Doctor beckoned to the latter, who obeyed the sigual at once. ' George,' said the Captain, looking up, ' there is one thing I had forgotten to ask of you iu my distraction of mind. The lad Tambah slipped from my memory. Did he reach the outstation, or have you heard of his whereabouts ?' ?' IS'o, sir ; I have neither heard of him nor have I seen him.' *'Itwas near midnight when Joe and 1 left the out station, aud up to that time he had not put iu an appearance there,' said the Doctor. ' This is strange.' remarked the Captain, moodily. ' He has not returned here. What can have become of him?' 'Poor hid,' exclaimed Radcliffe: 'if those ras cally Tongois have got hold of him, all I can say is, May God help him, for surely by this time they have put him past human aid.' . The first grey streaks of dawn were making their appearance near the eastern horizon. .The whole of the station hands were- collected in a. group a few yards-distant from the frout of the dwelling, atieu tivcly listening to Gipsy Joe, who was furnishing them witti a 'detailed account of the previous day's catastrophes. Suddenly, aud to their evident sur prise, the heavy swinjc gate at the bottom of the enclosure creaked on its hinges, and shortly alter closed with a loud clang. The men, as if in one accord turned round, and silently peered into the darkness beyond, in the direction irom which the sounds came. After listening intently for nearly a minute, no one uttering a word, Giusy Joe took a few paces forward, exclaiming as he did so : ' Who, in the name of heaven, is this !' At the same time two human forms appealed toiling wearily up the pathway in the distance. The whole body of men impulsively moved forward to meet them, when presently shouts rent the air; loud and protracted hurrahs were repeated over and over again. All the inmates of the house hurriedly made 

 their appearance on the verandah, including Mrs. Brabazon, who was leaning heavily on the arm of Jane. ' What can be the meaning of all tbis?'saidtheCap- tain, appareutlygreatlr excited, as the crowd of men, exhibiting the wildest enthusiasm, approached nearer to the house. The suspense was only of short dura tion. When the body of men came within a few yards of the verandah', they withdrew to either side of the pathway, and then came Tambah walking wearily between them, bearing Willie across bis shoulders, and Bertie struggling along by his side. 'Well done, Tambah: he has saved 'the.boys,' was shouted iu every direction, as the Captain lifted his younger son from the shoulders of the brave aboriginal lad. Bertie tottered towards his mother, who smothered his face with kisses, while Tambah, as if now quite unconcerned, and ' apparently ex hausted, leaned heavily against one of the posts of the verandah, from which position he was soon removed by the Captain and his wife, the latter almost embracing hirn iu the exuberance of her grati tude and joy. Some hours subsequently, when the lads had suffi ciently recovered from the effects of their late suffer ings, they recounted all their past dangers and endurances, aud with tears of gratitude starting from their eyes related how gallantly Tambah had suc coured them, and saved them from unparalleled misery, if not from a cruel death. Mr. Vane, although sorely wounded, had, under the skilful care of Dr. Floyd, and the unremitting attention bestowed upon him by George Radclift'e during his protracted and enforced stay at the outstation for many weeks, slowly improved. He was ultimately re moved to Burraga House, where in the course of a few months he became partially convalescent, but, sad to say, from the seventy of his wounds never re covered his normal state of health. The Tongoi blacks were never afterwards known to camp, or put in an appearance iu the vicinity of Burraga. Indeed, it was currently reported throughout the district, later on, that an expedition led by George Radcliffe had finally settled accounts with the sable marauders. Twelve months had elapsed, and Christmas day came round again. Burraga House was once more decked with shrubs ard flowers. The midsummer sun had risen in all its glory, aud shed its lustre on the now almost finished dwelling, on the verandah of which stood Captain Brabazon. His wife and two sons clustered around an invalid's chair, on which reclined the pale and still emaciated form of Mr. Vane, on whom the endearments of the whole group were apparently lavished. Tam bah. the brave' and now stalwart aboriginal youth,, stood at a short distance fiom them arrayed in his best holiday attire. What were his thoughts no one could divine, for he gazed on the scene like a stoic, never moving -a -feature. Presently Mrs. Brabazon drew neaier to her husband. Placing her hand on his shoulders and looking straight into his eyes, while tears gathered in hers, she exclaimed softly and in broken accents, ' William, dear, the return of this holy day brings back mournful memories, let us give thanks to God for all his mercies for we never can forget that last TERRIBLE CHRISTMAS DAY.'
