 Chapter IV. (Continued). 

 George roae from his chair and sauntered towards one of the pillars as Pauline disap peared, where he beat time with his whip to an inward accompaniment of "Tommy Dodd." His elation was sobered by the grave aspect of Madame Delaunay, who came notselesBly np to him. She too felt that he had gained in manliness Bince she had seen him. His beard and moustache were bushier. There were traces, she fancied, of thought and meditation in his eyes, which had acquired indeed a more earnest expression than for merly. George himself wonld have Bnpposed they showed traces of loo-parties and unful filled "doubles," and wonld most probably have prescribed bimself a " pick-me-np." He was somewhat in awe of Pauline's grand mother, never feeling himself quite at ease in her presence. He wbb troubled with a sort of latent consciousness that were it possible for her to gauge his abilities and strength of character, and to see, laid bare before her, the inner workings ol his mind, she would send bim away, as he stood there, bare headed in the sunshine, and conjurehim, for Pauline's sake, and his own, never to come again on the errand which had brought him to-day. There was an uneasy fear at work within him; whenever he was alone with her, that she would go beyond hie depth ; and in a very modified degree he had something of the same feeling with regard to 

 Pauline. 

 " I won't give her a chance of flooring me,"; he said to himself. " I'll take the bull by tbe homB; see if I don't!" He drew forward a chair for her deferentially, and began with a 

 Srelimiuary "clearing of the throat. It was 

 is castomtocall her Madame, because Bhe 

 went by the name of " Madame" in the household, and once long ago, when he had said "Mrs. Delaunay," every one in the room had looked as shocked, as if he had spoken of the Queen as Mrs. Albert! "You 

 see, Madame, I've been as good as my word! j 

 You said I could try�dotft you remember saying so�that 1 could try for myself at the 

 end of two years�I'm more in earnest tiian i 

 ever about what I told you. You won't ] stand in my light now, will you ?" 

 He was twitching at the leaves of the scarlet passion flower that had twisted itself round the verandah railings, as he spoke. George had no repose of manner� when be was agitated hands, feet, and eye brows were all at work. Madame Delaunuy's English all but forsakes her, iu the desire to discourage him, without implying in too uncomplimentary a fashion that she does not want him for a grandson-in-lnw. 

 "One is not pressed, Monsieur Shorge, one | 

 is not pressed!" 

 "I don't know what yon call pressed, Madame! After a fellow's had only one thought in his head, night and day, for over two years, it'a rather rough on hioi to be crossed just when he thinks he's got a pretty 

 fair show of success." 

 "liuido you figure to yonrself seriously 

 that Pauline would render you happy 

 She did not ask him whether he thought he could render Pauline happy. Dividing men, according to tberaleof the great French novelist, into the two classes of those who understand women and thoBe who don't, George must have belonged to the latter division. 

 Madame Delaunay herself had known the rare bliss of being associated with one of the other kind�a man who had made her happy through all the best years of her life, in the beat possible way,by never falling short of her first estimate of him. Enthusiasm for a pursuit is only a more satisfying feeling than enthusiasm for an individual because it is not attended by the same invariable disappointment. If men only knew the heart-sickness of discovering all the alloy, the dross, the common earth, so carefully concealed during tbejfeys when, like birds, they attune their voices and smooth their plumes to go a-courting, they would main rain some tew delusions a little longer, when the courting waB over. Women, as a rule, are easily imposed spon, and it is clumsy policy to Bbatter their idols when they are so anxious for something to worship. 

 There was so dreary an intonation inj 

 Madame Delaunay's somewhat laboured 

 enunciation, as she put this question to] �George, that it almost forced him into an| instant's deep thought 

 "I'd take my chance of that thank you!" he said. "And mind you, Madame, Miss Pauline shouldn't want for a thiug I had it in my power to give hen She'd nave the beat mount in the district, I can tell yon, and she could always have a friend to stop with her any time she felt doll." 

 Pauline did not hear this elaborate scheme on her behalf She came oat of the house in a big straw hat; which George, under hit present impression that she was an angel, dimly connected with a halo radiating from the. anreole which encirded her head. His 

 �angel led turn to the croquet, lawn, dis coursing the while upon the toying down of the tort, as it that branch of practical gar dening had been included In her school-bill under the heading of " washing, gymnastics, ?extras, dec.;** thence to the lemon-grove, �where she rigorously confined George to the subject of shaddocks, and finally to the new -bathing-bouse, where he pleads sudden fatigue, and finds a resting place on the 

 narrow strip of beach which fronts the bay. [ 

 Pauline is fain to rest herself too. 

 The tide most quietly ebbing beneath them, as it rises and falls leaves with eachheave a long line of broken sheila, and tangled eea wesd, and |Nwti-c<rtoafedacumi>poa the sand at their feet These are tbe hostages tbe greet ncean deposits with Mother Earth as it

 Work has teaajput 

 I call you Miss Pauline? You don t look like Mun Vjner somehow 1" 

 ?'You must haw expected to find me at point of death at the very least," she answeiB, laughing shortly; you seem so astonished to find me in ordinary health. Yon're lite grandma, who was so taken aback the other day because a rheumatic old woman whom she treated to a blister told her she was , pretty spry,' and that she didn't want any of her doctoring. Ob, yea! Call me Miss Pauline of course, if yon like�only it's a little like the gardener. Still I don't like being called 

 Miss Vyner much either." 

 "Do you remember what I used to call you, when I was here before? I've never forgotten those rides we had together�never! You can't tell how often I've thought of them. I always said they were out and out the jolliest�I mean the happiest�hoars I ever 

 spent in my life." 

 " YS!1 nlU8t be very amiable to find so ptjch happiness in teaching any one how to hold the reins properly I Who was your next pupil after me ?" 

 'I didn't want any more; I wouldn't have hod one for something after yon." , . 

 "An equivocal compliment�that 1 How 

 am I to take it?" 

 "Ob, you know what I mean,"says George, bis sentimentalism very gennine and red-hot by this time. "I'm no hand at paying compliments. That's the worst of me. I feel fifty per cent-more than I say. I've bottled up what 1 thought about you over 

 two years and mure. I can't keep it in any5 longer. On my honour I can't. Don't get I up�lentreatyou! Don't mind my taking! your hand�just for one minute. I beseech j you�Pauline�hear a fellow out! Ever since j I was here before, that time j I've never had! you out of my head for a day. Don't be | vexed with me: I wouldn't have Bpokenj about it how only I coufdn't'help it somehow. | I only want you to say you're not fond of j anyone else�that's all�and that you might get to care about me, you know. Yon can't 

 imagine�it's no use telling you the Bort of j feeling I've got for yon. I didn't think it was j in me to care so much for anyone." j 

 All this time Pauline is silent Perhaps she scarcely bears the last part of his speech. George sees her pull her broad-brimmed hat close over her downcast face; there is a pulse beating somewhere near her throat she never felt before, and her heart has taken to running a Binall race against it, bo that she feels all throbs and beats from her brain downwards. 

 His voice iB more snbdaed than before. 

 "You're not offended, Miss Pauline?" he asks. " I'll go when yon like, you know, but won't you give me some sort of a hope first ? I only came across to Sydney for this." 

 No answer. 

 The soft Bea-breeze bas freshened into a wind, and ont at sea there are tiny flakes of white, dancing, bobbing, straggling with each other, appearing and disappearing, coming nearer and pirouetting about the boats and ships, like tiny sprites playing at hide-and-seek. 

 George begins to feel uncomfortable. He applies himself busily to the work oi boring 

 a hole in the sand at his feet with the butt end of his riding-whip. This ia a drilling operation which requires some nicety. 

 Next time he speaks his tones are hoarse. 

 " There'll be nothing left for me to do, I suppose, but to go and hang myself. My God 1 it's a nice thing to give yourself up, heart and soul, to one girl, and then to be treated to the cold shoulder!" 

 There is-such real passion in his voice that Pauline jumps up from her resting place. 

 " Please don't, Mr. Drafton!" this very pleadingly. "I do so wish you wouldn't. Don't you think we'd better come. back to the house now ?" 

 Sheatands before bim, while George probes the loose sand more viciously then ever, making never a move towards rising the 

 while. 

 "Don't what? Don't tell you what I had on the tip of my tongue a dozen times when I was here before! If you'd waited as long as I have, you might be in a hurry to speak too. However, the murder's out now, and I'm not sorry for it. Ob, Pauline," with a Budden imploring desperation in bis eyes, " lor Heaven's sake don't drive me from yon ! I can be anything yon choose to make me. Give me a chance�only one. Do you want me to go to the dogs altogether?" 

 An expression of pained perplexity in Pauline's face ia all that he can see, as he looks hungrily np at her where she stands. 

 She is a novice, and moreover a coward. 

 In her embarrassment she pulls out a bit of frippery in the shape of a handkerchief from a little slit in her black ailk apron, and twists it nervously round her wrist as she 

 replies confusedly and with hesitation. 

 *' You make me so sorry�for yon, I mean ! It isn't my fault, if I can't cate for anybody much�in that way, at least�is it ? I never did�I don't think lever shall Bat all sorts of things may happen in the future. Do let us forget what you said just now, Some one has been cooeying frantically tons for the lost five minutes." 

 And George finds a loophole of hope in her answer. She is already half-way up the garden path before he overtakes her, and while he is wondering bow to renew the attack, a dumpling of a boy, with sagacious eyes, hurls hlauelfegainst Pauline, ana walks by her aide with an air of proprietorship. 

 ? " How. d'ye do, little man," says George, condescendingly putting out hie band. 

 " How do you do, sir!" says the little man stiffly, raising bis garden hat _ "You are en acquaintance of Paul�of Miss 

 �, Vyner's, I believe. I have the honour to be her maternal uncle." 

 AH George's wrought-up feelings cannot prevent hie breaking into a guffaw. 

 Ah me: late they all on a' par then?! Chubby's dignity, and George's longings, and! Pauline's aspirations ? A<1 an outlet of the samp force which palls the strings that set j ns�earthy puppets�dancing for awhile until 

 the dance of death whirls us oat of sight sad j memory. j
