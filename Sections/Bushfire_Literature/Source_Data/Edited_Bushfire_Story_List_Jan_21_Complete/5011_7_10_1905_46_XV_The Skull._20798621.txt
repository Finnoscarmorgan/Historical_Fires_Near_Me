 BOYS' STORY. 

 CHAPTER XV.-The Skull. 

 By "BULLOO." 

 At the first sign of day the lads crept forth to see how their fire had fared, and found it, together with the gunyah, blown clear away. One more 

 f / of Rory's slender stock of matches uWere drawn from the watertight box, and they were shortly seated by an in vigorating glow munching their food. What a scene of wreck presented it *eif to their view. Tall trees snapped ' Off short, and smaller ones uprooted. (Leaves and branches lying in all direc ijtiona, while in many Instances bushes Iliad been torn out of the ground. Par iTOts and other small birds were lying toead partly stripped of feathers, and Jan eagle of great size lay dying at the r back of the gunyah, with broken leg f fend wings. The ground was sodden jln places, and gullies had been cnt j With the rush of the surface water. >< �? There is no doubt about luck stand - -Ing to us," said Allan. "We might j&ave been killed if we had been out ride." \\f "It only confirms what I said be fore," replied Rory. "We are going to fbe brought out of our troubles alright /TDur guardian angels are watching over f *s." p They turned their steps towards ttoe �Jfcanoe with very little hope of finding It, except in a shattered condition, and brere agreeably surprised to see it was ' ilntact. The dense clump of bushes in nrhtch It bad been hidden having pro < lected it from the force of the storm. Is JThe sea had been driven ihigh upon plhe beach, tearing millions of tons of nand away from the shore, and leav vHng the hummocks with a bluff fall of flight or ten feet instead of the gradual Vfelope which had existed previously. k-The waves still ran high, and all mope of renewing the voyage for that {hay was abandoned, to the secret de fjtght of Rory. who wished to spend an ; |>ther day in the vicinity of the dock jlagoon. Neither was Allan reluctant 'ftp have a day's rest, for sleep had men quite fragmentary during the ?Hglht, and he willingly accompanied Ibis brother to the lagoon. MBut here also a great change had mime o'er the scene, for at the approach Bbf the storm the birds had flown en masse to the narrow pools in the creek, ?tad wisely, for the cyclone had swept ?ie islet away and flattened the rushes ?> the level of the Water. A few birds, ?bcludlng a small flock of wild geese, bd returned, and, bereft of his anti ?ffpated pleasure in watching the birds, ntory determined to obtain some. B! ."How will you do it without shoot- U| T" demanded Allan, " for you know ?re can't waste a shot on such small L " I'm going to snare them the waj be blacks do. te tome of tbe islanda*" Bras the reply. "Ton see, the geese roost <gn the same tree they did yesterday, luid the marks show it is their favour ite place." '?< Taking one of the fishing lines the Hacks had left in the canoes, the lad ipproached the tree, and, the birds laving flown away with angry " kark carks," climbed to their favourite ranches. Gutting up the line Into tultable lengths, he made them into oops, secured to the limbs, and placed imall pieces of meat so that the birds �ould not obtain them without placing heir heads in the loop. He then with- Irew, and, making a detour, frightened he geese from the trees In which they , lad perched. ! The birds circled round the lagoon, � perceiving their, accustomed camp free, returned to It. They shortly >vered the meat, and made sharp is at it, shooting- out their long sin eagerness. Then, to use Boy's ession, "the fun began." Some Isvere caught by the neck and others by She leg ; in one case two had snapped lit the same bait and were caught to- Jjgether. Six loops had been set, and jgeven birds were accounted for, while ?the outcry they made in their dying jsjtruggles scared the others away. SHaving more game than they required JTor immediate use, the flesh was strip ped from the birds and hung in the jjpmoke of a green wood fire for some Stlme, and then hung in the full glare hb/ the sun. " Thaf s what I call something like," exclaimed Rory in tones of perfect self :�atisfaction, standing with his legs nrell apart and his thumbs in imaginary jfcraistcoat holes. "It takes me to run $he commigshariat department, bedaCL" There certainly was a good supply T>f food, and Allan reciprocated his brother's feeling of contentment The sea still ran too high on the fol lowing morning, so Rory suggested a ?small exploring trip, and Allan, being Aothing loth, they packed the meat jaway in the gunyah, securing the en trance with a large sheet of bark ob tained from the ruins of another. They followed the creek up towards 

 the ridges, and gathered a better Idea of the force of the cyclone, for a space nearly a mile wide had been denuded of standing trees. For three miles they followed the path of the storm, and could see the same effect for a long distance ahead of them. Dead and dying birds were met with, and also an old-man kangaroo with a broken thigh. They put the poor animal out of its misery, and, not. requiring the flesh, left it for the emus and dingoes. Returning to the camp they walked parallel with the coast for some dis tance, when, perceiving the country was of a similar character to that which they bad already seen, they strol led slowly back. The rough weather, as Is usual In these latitudes, was succeeded by calms and mild winds for a few days, so in the morning the ocean had justified its name, and become sufllciently pacific for them to embark. Rory wished to rig some sort of a sail, but Allan point ed out the unpleasant fact that if the canoe dipped its nose more than a few inches they would be swamped. " No," he said ; " we must paddle our own canoe until we are picked up, or can construct a more serviceable craft" By this time their clothing was re duced to legless trousers and hats. Their skins had been burnt by the heat, and roughened by salt water and ex posure, so that they would at first 

 glance have been taken for half castes. Their sole belonginga, except the revol ver, knife, and fishing tackle, were a few pounds' weight of smoked birds' flesh, which was packed carefuHy In the middle of the canoe. It was tiring work squatting hi the frail, crank craft, and using the paddle all day with the sun beating down on their back; but they were young, strong, and deter mined, and, to use Rory's expression, "plugged along an right" More than once they beheld the sails of a distant vessel, or the smoke of a steamer, but were never sufficiently near to be seen. They would have kept further out from the shore, and more in the track of ships, but would have been unable to reach hind in the event of a capsize. The monotony of the three days was occasionally broken by Rory trailing a fishing line behind the canoe, be ing more or less successful, and by landing in the evening. Then there was a break of windy weather, and they were ashore for nearly a week, during which time they lived on fish and birds snared by Rory. The last experience was so annoying they determined to either build a boat or paddle to an island nearer the ocean highway, and maintain a constant smoke until they were noticed by a ship and rescued. The country was scoured for miles round, but there were no bottle-trees, and to scoop out a gum-tree with a knife or by burning to make a craft large enough to convey them under soil with any degree of safety would be the work of months, so that idea was abandoned, and they only waited for calmer weather to reach one of the islands lying to fbe east and within sight Tired of waiting for a calm day, the lads at length embarked one moonlight night, and by daybreak were close to islands of various sizes, from the tiny atoll of an acre in extent to one of three miles in length, and two thirds as wide* 

 " Thaf s the one for us," cried Rory, Indicating the largest "It has a hill at one end that will do splendidly for a beacon fire, and there must be water where those ti-trees are; besides, I saw a kangaroo up in the ferns." " We must find a better landing place, though," replied Allan. "It is too rocky (here. It Is no. use getting the canoe damaged�we may want it again, after all." They paddled round a rocky point which ran out into a jagged reef, and found themselves entering what ap peared to be a tidal creek, but the channel, turning sharply to the left, a perfect little land-locked bay lay be fore them. It was only three or four acres In extent, but carried deep water right up to the bank. On one side a rock wharf rose bluff out of the sea, but tiie remainder of the shore shelved gradually to the water's edge In a shelly beach. Tall timber grew close to the bay, interspersed with bracken and bushes, but here and there were open grassy glades resembling an Eng lish park. "Bedad, It's the prettiest place I ever saw," exclaimed Rory. "Sure, if s a little paradise." "It is pretty," said Alan ;" but what is more to the purpose, it's full of game. See how that water couch has been cropped down. If the blacks have not been here lately we won't

Fish stWn imjpmto&CJHH " It waV^fcb^ai^narmlng spot, the lads felt no great inclination to land, toot paddled round the harbour, gaslng down into the pelncld depths of the sea, and admiring the graceful coral and yiTld marine plants. M There's a regular garden for yon," cried Rory, pointing down. � Look at all those colours. Did yoa erer see anything prettier T " I've seen lots of things prettier than that, though," replied Allan, pointing to a human skull lying in three fathoms of water below them. The shock caused by the discovery of the skull beneath them was of only momentary duration, for as Bory im mediately remarked, "It may be a nigger's." They landed on the sandy beach dose to the rock wharf, and haaUng the canoe up amongst the bushes proceeded to look for a suitable place to camp. Water was of course the lint requis ite, and this was found in a lagoon at the foot of the hill which had attracted Rory's notice previously. The latter was about a hundred and fifty feet high sloping near the camp, and precipitous on three sides. A site was chosen between the lagoon and tbe hill where they were hidden from view, where' there was abundance of firewood handy, while a spreading epala provided shade. Bestowing the meat in a safe place the lads, although they had had no sleep the previous n)ght ( ascended the hill and climbed on to* an immense flat rock. " What a glorious view," exclaimed Allan, " We can see for miles." To the east lay two small islands, and beyond the illimitable ocean, shaded blue, green, and brown accord ing to the bottom, while it broke sul lenly over a submerged reef. North, south, and west, more islands, in many forms and colours, the mainland range towering in sombre above them. A solitary 

 whale spouted lazily shoreward*, un happy mullet fry leaping from the sea on its approach fearing the voracious poonbah. A^flock of pigeons, resemb ling a cloud, rushed through the air, the Bwish of their rapid wings herald ing their approach, and swooping as an eagle darting amongst them secured his evening meaL The scene had taken complete possession of Allan, who sat on the edge of a rock gazing seawards, but Rory, the restless, urged by the claims of the inner man, suggested smoked goose would not come amiss, and the lad with a sigh arose. Looking over the island to the south �they were at the northern end�they perceived the country was generally open, with fair sized timber and well grassed. They also saw kangaroos and emus, while the air resounded with the shrieks of parrots and galahs. Having made a hearty meal they lay under the epalas intending to make a gunyaih when they had rejAa�VhjrtMor pheus pressed his cltftf^s^tyMn�tly that they dosed <tfM�t�jrttnra4T�e\\p.

" It's sundown, and we haven't built a gunyah," said Allan prosaically, " and tiie dew will be as heavy as. light rain." " Oh, we'H soon fix that up," replied Rory, " You go and wash the dirt off your faoe, and I'll build a rale mansion before you know where you are. be dad." The lad's quick eye had caught sight of a tail sapling which had been broken by some recent storm, and as the top still clung to the stump a few feet from the ground, he broke down a quantity of bought and leant them against It, forming quite sufficient shelter' from the dew. Having enjoyed such an invigorating sleep, they had no inclination for a further one, and taking the lines pro ceeded to the harbour. They used roast goose for bait, and were not successful until a small iisfa, resembling a mullet, was caught Rory cut it np, and plac ing a portion On his hook was rewarded by landing a fine bream. Allan, using the same bait, caught a tlbree-pound tar whine, when using the entrails of the fish they had caught they soon had more than was required for breakfast, and as the elder lad never cared to catch flsh for the mere sake of sport, they returned to the camp, where they chatted until Rory said, pointing to the flsh suspended from a bough, " Bedad, those beauties are calling to me, and I must have wan at laste. Phwat d'ye say, Boss ?" " Well, I do feel as If I could man age a little supper," said Allan, with a laugh, " But one of those tarwhine will be as much as I can manage." Rory roused fits brother in the morn ing by crowing like a rooster, and running to the wharf they plunged into the bright clear water." " Now for the stall," said Rory, and swimming to where it had been seen, he took a big breath and dived down, reappearing with It " Bedad, he dldat die of the cholera mortals," he exclaimed, throwing It to his brother on the shore. "He received a chop on his bump of brotherly kind ness." A deep indentation in the skull gave evidence that the original owner bad received a terrible wound from a toma hawk, or some other keen weapon, wielded by a strong arm. MI don't think it was a blockfellow," safd Allan, "the forehead is too high and straight And I should not be surprised if it were a girl or a lad. It is not a large skull, and the teeth are very even and perfect" " Well, as we are not likely to solve the mystery by rambling it," replied Rory, **I beg to move we adjourn to breakfast 'Sweet tnrwhlne, I smell thee, no�/ as the Scotchman said about fragrant Edinburgh." In looking about for material for a gunyah they discovered a cavity in the face of the hill at no great distance from their camp. A huge rock bad become detached, tearing away earth and bushes in its descent leaving a hole some Bft. by 10ft The roof was of solid rock, while the sides were of mingled earth and rock. Rory's sharp eyes had first discovered it and he pointed it out to his brother, exclaim ing, " The very thing, bedad. Just what we want, and that little pebble over there beyont has obligingly made a first-class road up to it." M It's not at all bad," replied Allan, 

 "All we require Is some sort of a door, and we shall be as snug as pos sible."- We can smooth a place in front for the fire. Wb shall not need a door, though, for Hie rain seldom comes from that quarter." While Allan lerelled the surface In front; Rory cot a quantity of long grass for bedding, and, by the time tola brother had completed his task, had made two couches, one on either side, a foot deep. A sufficient quantity of flsh was then caught for the day's requirements, and armed with a re volver and the knife lasfied to a sap ling, they set out to explore their new possession. The land was almost level from the foot of the hill, being only a few feet higher than the shore of the harbour, with several lugoons well stocked with waterfowl, and a stream which start ing from a rushy pool ran gently to the sea. Large game, in the shape of kangaroo, was abundant, but they saw neither emu nor their tracks, nor did they discover any recently made traces of blacks. "That's satisfactory, at any rate," remarked Allan, "though I expect they'll find us out if we stay here, but I hope we shall not" M Now for a beacon lire," said Allan, in the morning, * Thank goodness there_ are plenty of trees on the top of thefl hill, and we shall require wood, for we must keep a good smoke going every day." " Don't you think tfie ships will fancy the fire has been made by blacks ?' said Rory. "No, blacks don't make continuous big smokes, their signal smokes are big, but they don't last The only thing I'm afraid of is that they may not take the trouble to find out the cause." The fire was made on the rock at the summit of the hill, and when a suf ficient body of coal had been formed, the greener wood was supplied, sending up a dense smoke. " Bedad, that's spiffing," cried Rory, "They'll see that miles and miles away, won't they ?" But Allan did not respond, and Rory turning towards him. saw a look of perplexity on his face. " What's the matter with you V he demanded. "In a few days the supply of fallen wood will be exhausted, and we have no axe or other means of obtaining a further supply/ said Allan, "Had it not been for tine cyclone we should have had to carry every stick up the biH." 41 "Bedad, that's throe, for you," waaV the gloomy reply, "Then what shall we do r "We must husband our resources, and only light a fire when there is a ship in sight" " Well, there's one now," cried Rory, pointing to the Southern horiaon. A steamer's smoke was faintly visible, and the lads eagerly watched It But although It drew near enough for the funnel and masts to be seen, their appeal for help was disregarded, although the lads feverishly fed the fire with green boughs until a dense column of smoke arose and drifted away to the North. As the steamer gradually grew more Indistinct, Rory threw himself on the ground, exclaiming, " The brutes, the hard hearted, selfish brutes. They must have seen the smoke, and they must know it is a signal for help. I wish I were alongside that skipper I'd, I'd " " Don't despair, old boy," said Allan, soothingly, " No doubt they thought it Was a bush fire. No ship would know ingly scout an appeal for assistance.'*^ But although the lad remained silent,' his spirits for the time being were crushed, and he sat for an hour gaz ing with dry eyes in the direction of the vessel. Deeming it best to leave him to ihlmself for a while, Allan de scended the hill, and proceeded to make The Hole, as Rory called it, a little .more comfortable. With an ironbark sapling, hardened In the fire, he cleared enough earth away from two or three stones in the walls to form shelves, and placed two large stones for seats. He also im proved the space already cleared for the fire, and constructed a rough fireplace, but as tihey had no cooking utensils It was only useful in preventing the ashes and firewood from rolling down the hill.
