It becomes our painful dotv whilst sympathising with tho above demented individual, to purgo tho taints of falsehood from the minds of tho ono or two accidental readers of the Min or, and to lay Wore tho general public, in onr columns, an incidental proof of tho fact, that to Wan- ueratta falls tho distinction of handing down to posterity the sevonth day of this month as the champion scorcher. � It will ho remembered by all who tnlto a healthy interest in tho progress of Australia, that some years ago a man was murdered on tho bridgo which here spans tho Ovens Hiver, sail which is overlooked by tho town. Soon after the murder, rumors began to move that a ghost had been seen at various times sitting on tlie railing of tho bridge, just over the spot where tho deed was committed ; but, as is invariably tho case in such matters, tho minority who caiv the ghoEt were looked upon as liars or fools by tho majority who did not seo tho ghost. Finally tho apectro droppod into a state of oblivion�a stalo it would probably havo continued to enjoy but for its indiscretion on the night of the sixth. Mr. Johnstone (a gentlemen whoso ill-health has induced him to try the virtues of our puro air) had occasion to pass the northern sido of onr town about mid night on the night in question, and was much surprised, on looking towards tho bridge, to heboid a wbito liguro seated on the railing. Tearing that some somnambulistic efforts were endangering tho life of a townsman, Mr. John stone, "with philanthropic motives, walked in tho direction of tho bridge ; but, ou approach ing within 50 yards, was horrified to discover that tho object of bis careful thought was nothing more or less than an animated ihalow. Too fearful to advance, too ntneh overcome to reteat, tho gentleman gazed for s moment or two in petrified wondor upon tho ghost, whilst the latter, seeming not to notice ils human companion, heaved a deep sigh, and drawing forth a shadowy handkerchief seemed to wipe tho pcr- ipintiou from its shadowy brow, apparently in a slate of great exhaustion. Mr. Johnstone hoi jnst timo to observe that the spectre was much overcome, when animation returned to his momentarily paralysed limbs, and ho fled from the scene. On the afternoou of tho fol lowing day� tho 7th� Mr. Johustono being unable to banish the rision from his mind, and being enticed by that sirange fascination which often draws people towards a dreaded spot, miked down to the bridge, and closely inspect ing the place where the ghost had sat, dis covered a minute grease spot upon the pine railing. He searched tho part carefully and thought tho matter out, but was unable to con nect the presenco of the grease spot with any natural cause. For ninny minutes he considered the question, and at lust, like a flash of light the truth burst upon him � tho ghost! Yes, the natural assumption, based npoa circumstan tial testimony, was, that tho spirit of tho tendered muu, indiscreetly venturing forth on the night of the 6th, was so overcome by tho sultry atmosphere as to be unable to retreat to its mysterious abode, and, falling a victim to tho unparalleled heat of tho following day (tho 7lh), was melted down and reduced to a single spot ol grease," No I there could bo no donbt tlmt tie 7th January, 18 � was a hot day.

Wove got a big thing on to-day, Frank: that s, if you feel up to it. Of course, I'm not going to drag yon into a day's work simply becauso I tackle it myself," "Ho, I'm about, my boy! What's on tho board t" "Very well; if yon are about, show Ihat you mean business by wiring into this !" and ns tie spoke Leo opened an adjacent cupboard, aud produced therefrom a round of cold beef and a oaf of bread, "This is not much of a meal, but we canuot wait for tho ordinary breakfast an hour hence ; so wado in, old fellow ; the cook brings a cup of tea in a fow minutes. I have just been on top of the hill at the back of I he stables, and I am sorry to find that the folks on the other sido of tho river liavcnot conquered the bush fire during tho night, ns I hoped tiioy would have done. That wus their only chance, for it is simply impossible to do anything with these scrub tires in the day time. It is coming uown across tho mallec with groat fury even thus early, and when it reaches the silver grass plains under the lieat of a powerful sun, its speed will be terrible." " It won't cross tho river, I suppose ?" " It is possible that odd sparks may drift over and light the grass on onr side, but all our hands will bo stationed along tho river's hank to quench at once asy fires thus started. It is the Kolkibcrtoo people I feel anxious nbout." "Eh? Kolkibcrtoo ? That's wbcrc Laura lives, ain't it ?" "Yes 1" " Gad 1 what a slow-brained fellow I mast be. I should just bavo sat here all day and let tho fire have its fling, never thinking that Kolkibcrtoo was right between it and tho river! Lot us hurry up, Leo! What do you propose to do ? Think there's any danger over there?" " As to harrying np, wo cannot start until the trap and horses are ready, so you can spare five minutes more ovor your breakfast. Dan ger? Well, no; I hardly think there is ; it's more than likely that Mr. King will havo taken all necessary precautious in tho way of removing the ladies and valuables, as soon as ho found tho fire hod got tho best of him. However, it is just possible that sncli precau tious may have been overlooked, and I propose that we should drive over at once and soe for ourselves., If tho - ladies are- still there, we shall yet bavo time to briug them away." Tho hasty meal was soon completed, and tho two friends drovo off at a rapid pace for Kolkibcrtoo. .Mr. Morton came oat of his room in timo , to wave them adieu, as they passed tho front of tho house ; then bo turned to listen to bis house keeper Bridget, who at that moment accosted him. "Ifyo plaizo sor, Doctlier Frayno's afthcr lavin a miesagc,' whin ycz'd bo up, would yez plnizego down to the hut, to sec tho man as wuz lost, an' he been bad in tho noight." . Mr. Morton put on his bat and walked leisurely over to a hut which stood apart from thoso used by tho station bands. This was known as tho traveller's hut, and at tho eztranco he was met by Doctor Frayno. "1 understand that this poor fellow has had a bad night, doctor ? Do you think bis caso serious?" " I do indeed ; the man 13 in the first stages of a rapidly progressing brain fovcr, and you know what that means in this sort of weather, lie has not really wandered in his ruind yet, but signs of delirium are fast dovclopiug. At this moment the sick man tossed over on his bunk, and as he did so his fevered oyes rested on those of Mr. Mortou with a wild, bewildered stare. It was but a glance, for with n quick convulsive movement tho sufferer turned again ; but momentary as it was it seemed to recall to tho mind of Mr. Mortou tho memory of some distant dream. To him it was like the shadow of recognition which passed instantly away, hut tho other was evi dently moro impressed. " My God !" he muttered, as ho turned his hot faco ouco more to tho wall, " it is strange I How my head swims and throbs ; but it is real ; it was Morton � llarry Morton ; oil, I can swear to that 1 And I lit the fire to save my own wiscrablo life. Ah yes, everybody gets only ovil from me I Ila, ho, Ira! Well ; as lief he burned, as die n lingering death by thirst 1 But no, that is all over, and I am saved. I must not dream like this, I must keop calm for a short time, and do my duty lest I should die 1" Ho turned onco more upon his hunk. " Mor ton, I havo got something to toll you, which you will bo glad to hoar. Ha, ha 1 yos very glad� moro glad than ever you were iu your life before 1" " Poor fellow 1" said Mr. Morton, fighting against a strange inclination to believe that tho man really meant what he said; " his mind is going fast, I'm afraid doctor. I wonder how ho became 60 familiar with my namo ?" " My mind is going fast," replied the dry, husky voico. "I know it, aud for that reason oh, come closer, and listen to me 1 I've got such a groat secret to tell you !" "I think," said Doctor Frayno in a low voice, turning to his friend 1 ' that you had bettor not stay. Ho has been much moro excitable since lie saw you, and of courso it all tolls against him, and hastens tho fever. Mr. Mortoon turned to go. " No, no 1 Don't go 1 I say you must not go without hearing mo I it's the last chance, aud I moan to make a clean breast of it." Something seemed to hold tho master of Wyalong against his inclination ; but Doctor Frayno pushed him gently towards the door, " Ho gets worse and worso in this feverish fancy of his. Go, Henry ; tho sooner tho better." " No I Como back, Morton ; come back for tho love of Heavon 1 Good God; can I. do nothing 1 Oh, my cursed life 1 Ha, ha, ha 1 Flames and smoko " . " Caluryourself," Baid tho doctor, forcing tho man down upon his bunk. "Mr. Morton will come back soon, when you aro well and strong again." . But from that time the maduess of braru- Wver grew rapidly, ud w violent worn wo

CrtAFTEn X. � Finn akd Vevoeaxce. At Kolkibcrtoo, on tho morning ia question, nil was bustlo and confusion. At daybreak Mr. KiDg, with all tho station hands nud a large contingent of holpers from N returned to tho homestead after a night of fruitless struggles with the fire. A smoko- begriined and weary hand they were, and tho ladies, including Miss Stretch, worked hard at tho tasK of providing thorn nil manner of refreshments ; but their time for rest had not yet come, for, after a hasty meal and half an hour's respite, thoy must hasten to tho river und assist the stockman to force across the stream Buch of tho station stock ns they had been able to muster. It was a foregone con clusion that, except in tho extremely improbable event of rain, tho fire must sweep right over Kolkibcrtoo during the day, and tho only pos sibility of saving the cattle rested in forcing them to swim the river before the lire camo down upon them. It was just a question whether thero was sufficient time for the per formance of this task, and Mr. King was in a painful state of perturbation. His grass lie could not savo; bis homestead, a ricketty structure at host, was insured for moro than its value ; the stock, however, there was a chance of rescuing, aud so singly did lie set his mind upon this ono object that, but for tho inter vention of a comparative stranger, he would probably have overlooked the claims of his women-kind to bo rescued from what would soon become a perilous position. At the last moment he unfolded his plans for their safety. 'Laura," lie said, as he rode past tho verandah on his way to tho river, "two horses are harnessed to the bnggy in tho stable yard, where they will stand ready for a hasty departure. My papers aro in the buggy, aud I shall como hack from the river on foot by way of tho lagoon ford ; it is a short cut. Fou bo prepared to start off with me immediately on my return, as thero may be no time to lose. Thero will bo no danger for three or four hoars, ns at its present rnto of travelling the fire cannot roach hero in less time." With these pnrting injunctions, Mr. Kiog rode after the band of laborers who wero already on their way to the river. And thus it happened that, when Leo and his friend drove up to Kolkiborto two hours later thoy found tho ladies by themselves. No timo was wasted in introductions, for Frank was an old acquaintance of the Kings ; and greet ings having been exchanged, Leo proceeded to business in a manner which plainly showed that he thought the case an urgent one. "Now ladies, I have no wish to alarm you, because there ' is really no danger if we act promptly ; but Mr. Axford and I havo driven over to remove yon from Kolkibcrtoo, and I am bound to toll you that yon should bo ready to leave hero in a quarter of an hour, or sooner if possiblo." " But we cannot go, Mr, Morton," exclaimed Laura anxiously, "papa expects us to wait here with the) buggy until he returns ; the horses aro standing harnessed and ready to start the moment ho arrives. Besides, ha said the fire conld not roach here for three or fonr hours, and barely two have elapsed as yet." " No doubt," Leo replied, "Mr. King's judgmont was correct in a sense, but a strong wind has risen since ho made bis calculation, aud tho fire must be travelling now twice as fast as it was an hour ago." " 0, I do hope you are mistaken, Mr. Morton. I don't know what to do 1 Papa said we were to wait for him, and it would bo a fcarfnl thing if ho should return on foot trusting to find the horses here and discovered that we had driven off. Can't we stay to tho very last moment ? He is coming by tho lagoon track, and may be here at any minute." " Well, Miss King, I consider that tho last moment has already arrived ; and I don't feel justified in advising any course short of imme diate departure. My two horses aro fairly tired already, and as there will bo pretty heavy loads for both traps, wo shall not bo able to travel fast." " Would it not bo a good plan," exclaimed Laura, catching at a new idea, " to start tho tired horses off at once with a heavy load ; then tho two fresh ones, with the buggy, could remain another half hour, and still have time to out pace the fire ? I dare say Frank would not mind staying with mo to the last moment ?" "Ohno; notatall !" said Frank, withadnhious look. "It it will be any satisfaction to you, Laura, chivalry demnmls tlwt I shonld wait here for the firs aud fizzio out of existence liko a de voted Spartan. I shall ba delighted, I'm sure 1 But look here � ycu say your father is coming back by the lagoon track, Now, if we also tako that route, wc shall meet him in the case of his starting from the river. Don't yon think this a good idea, Loo ?" "Well, yes; it's a little moro risky than tho direct routo to N becauso the fore most arm of the fire is coming up the river's bank and by tnking tho lagoon track wc shall recede at nu angle, instead of directly away from it. But I think tho risk may be fairly run." It was finally arranged that Frank, with tho tired horses and tho hoavior load, should pro ceed direct to N ; whilst Leo with the two young ladies should pilot the buggy i-rrt tho lagoon track to tho puut. About half way botweou tho Murray aud tho homestead in a direct lino there stretched a long, narrow lagoon, its courso almost parallel with tho river ; and the road which Leo was to tako ran southwards until it reached this lagoon, then turned eastward along its northern bauk. At the point whore tho road struck tho lagoon, tho bonks of the latter narrowed in forming a rocky ford, so that pedestrians or horsemen could hero leave tho main punt track, and tako a direct coarse to tho river beyond. This was tho only crossing place for miles on either side, and Mr. King, iu order to reach his residence after his work with the cattle, would havo to cross at this point. When Leo's party reached this ford the fore, most arm of tho bush tiro, which had boon driven np the Murray by a westerly breeze, was within a quarter of a mile of them, on tho op posite side of the water, or mud rather, for the severe summer had reduced it to that state. "I think," said Loo addressing Miss King, as ho drew up at the ford; '|tbat you may make your mind easy respecting your father now. Ho_ would bare, to crow this ford if he 

 attempted to reach Kolkibcrtoo ; and, as the fire will have passed hero in a fow miuotes you may rest assured that, finding his retreat cut off, he will swim tho Murray and mako his escape with less trouble than ourselves, who will havo to drive hard yet, if this chippy wind should set in steady and strong. Of courso the lagoon defends us from tho fire, and there is no lmrnediato danger. What wo havo to guard against is its' burning around the farther end of tho lagoon before we reach there, aad thus get ting botween us and the pant." Laura expressed her opinion that nothing moro could bo done ; and Leo was about to renew_ tho journey when Miss Stretch called attention to tho figure of a man approaching at a hurried paeo from tho south A short scru tiny sufficed to eonvinco tho onlookers that this was Mr. King, and that he was straining every nerve to reach tho ford boforo tho flames, which were running over the long, dry grass at a fast rate. He was evidently much exhausted. The air was suffocatingly hot aud filled with stifiling gases aud smoke, and from tho moment that Leo first behold _ the distressed condition of tho pedestrian, he knew that ho could never reach the ford in time. Mr. King was still 200 yards from the party, when the fire swept past the ford ; and ho stood stock-6tilI, liko one struck powerless. Had thero been sufficient water ho might easily have plunged into the lagoon, and by swimming or wading havo made his escapo ; but tho deep, spewy mud would have smothered him at once, had he attcmptod such a plan. The position was critical in the extreme ; but Leo saw the one chance left, and, standing up in tho buggy, lie shouted � "The cave I Tho cave!" Tho hope thus excited seemed to striko fresh life into the stupefied man, and, turning quickly rouud, he ran with all speed towards tho whito wall of a bill which stood against the lagoon, 200 yards higher up. Kuttabul (wonderful) was tho aboriginal namo of this hill, which seemed to have been tossed, by somo strange commotion of nature, from the adjacent ranges out to the moro levol country, whore it stood solitary, one sido of it a steop wall of almost purely white pipeclay. Fully 100 feet np on this steep face thero was a deposit of specially whito clay, which thoso who knew of it prized much ns a snbstitutc for whiting. A track had been cut in tho wall, and, little by little, as the clay was carried away a spacious cave had bcon scooped out of the faco of the hill. At tho foot of the precipice, there was a con fused heap of logs which had fallen from time to time, from the wooded summit above, arid scrambling over these Mr. King bogau the ascent, having outpaced the fire by barely a minute. Ho made his way. quickly up the pathway, and was about to enter, tho cave, when a black figure moved out from the recess. It wai Yurijka. Tho Womra chief and his hated foe stood face to faco upon the narrow ledge. Mr. .King stared at tho blaokfellow with an expression which passed quickly from bewilderment to dread. Ho. seemed uncertain whether to retreat or advance, but the fire was now burniug with . great fury in the mass of rotten logs beneath ; he faced his antagonist, and iu an instant tho deadly strnggio commenced That the fight was for life, there could bo no doubt. There was no mistaking tho' pnrpoae , in the- Womra's eyes� a purpose which was vivid as light in darkness, oven through the settled blaukuess of growing insanity, which lent a weird strangeness to his wild presence.. As for the white man, he knows that while Yuroka lives his own existence is au uncertain thing. He told Sandy Forbes that " a black- tollow is never safe until he is dead," and, if Yuroka's strength should fail him ia this contest, lie must dio liko a dog or a snake. Tiro nature of tho struggle was visible ia every move and wrench ; in the fiercely set teeth and straining muscles, the look of foar, tho gleam of triumph, the lurchings backwards and forwards, tho critical strain, and tho sus pended effort at tho extreme edge ovor the hungry flames. Tho Womra was reduced in strength and vigor by the long months of hiding and bard- ships which ho bud lately uudcrgouo ; but on tho other band, his antagonist was already much exhausted by liis exertions in escaping tho fire. The issue was uncertain. Now tho ono, now tho other wus held at disadvantage, and forced inch by inch towards tho fatal cliff ; thon the sight of the cruel flames beneath spurred to a final effort, aud tho iurcli of terror brought tho stragglers buck to the wall. How about tbo tbrco spectators of that fcar fnl combat ? Their feelings must havo been boyond tho reach of imagination. AT tho out set, Loo, who occupied the front seat of the buggy, sprang to bis feet. Ho forgot for a moment the helplessness of his position, with the impassable lagoon ketwoeu him and the fighters, and wboa the horriblo truth burst upon him that he must staud aloof an inactive witness to tho sickening spectacle, ho turned and cast a hasty look upon liis companions. Laura, like himself, had sprang from her seat, as though she would rush to the rescue, bat Miss Stretch had locked her arms around tho girl's waist, and they were transfixed thus, tire one trembling and fearstricken, tho other palo and still as marble, clasping her friend with resolute arms. Not a wurd was spoken by tbo three who gazed upon tho thrilliug scene. Tho strength of the combatuuts was so even, the strugglo must liuve boon n prolonged one, but that the great weight of tho big rnau soon began to tell. Tho final tussle seemed to havo arrived, for Mr. King had lacked his antagonist in his arms, aud was forcing him by his very weight, over tho vcrgo of tho lodge. Already Yuroka's feet wero forced to tho sharp edgo of tho wall, his body loaning out over tho fire beneath. His moment was come 1 his doom sealed ! Then a gleam of triumph 6hot suddenly into tiro oyes of tho Womra chiof : his wiry fingers fosteued on tho collar of his foe ; ho leapt forward into tho empty spaco lurching tho whito man from the airy platform, and in a second of time the hungry flames closed on them both. Moniudio was avenged. A wild shriek rang through tho forest, and looking round onco more Leo found that Lauru had fainted in tho arms of her friond. The latter was bersolf looking much exhausted, but thero were signs of solf-control on her face, which convincod Leo that, with her, tho worst was over. Ho tightened the reins without offering any assistance, for his mind was now bent upon saving his party." " Miss Stretch, I tliiuk you can be very bravo : I sco determination ou your faco. Hold Miss Kiug firmly, and bear up for 20 miuntes ; then we shall ho safe!" lie turned to the 

 horses and forced them into a gallop, holding them together, picking tho even portions of tho road for them, and nnrsing their strength in every possiblo way. Some time had elapsed since the fire passed the ford, it had burned around the hill, and could now bo seen sweeping eastward, on the other side of lagoon, nearly half a mile in! ndvanco of the travellers. That half mile had to bo caught up, and tho flames out paced, before they reached tho end of the lagoon 7 miles further on ; otherwise tbeir passage to the punt would bo intercepted, and their position would become worso than peril ous. Could it be done ? Were these grass-led horses fit to do 7 miles in 20 minutes, with a reasonably heavy load behind them ? These wero tho questions which harassed Leo as he began the journey. lie knew that he must run a clear-headed, patient race, missing no point in favor of the horses, and above all that ho must guard against urging them beyond their length. And so the race commenced. The first 10 minutes of that drive was a timo of fearful oppression nud suspense to Leo and Miss Stretch. Tho air hot ns tho breath of a furnace, was thick with stifling smoke and gasses, and their ears were filled with tho incessant roar of tho fire, the hissing and crack ling of burning leaves, and the crash of falling branches. The lagoon on the right of them was alive with smuggling animals, that had rushed into their muddy grave iu their efforts to escapo the cruel flames. Lizards, snakes, kangaroos, wallabies, horses, slieep and cattle were writhing and surging there in the agonies of suffocation, whilst on every side of the refugees the birds fell fainting from tho wilted branches, to lie spread-winged and quivering upon the dry baked earth. Yet on I On for dear life's sake ! In 10 minutes nearly 4 miles had been traversed, and Leo had forced his horse9 nasfc the fire. The question on which their safety now hung was as to whether or not .the animals had staying powers sufficient to keep the advan tage for another 3 miles. Leo turned oucc more to his companions. Laura had recovered her senses, but was still lying helpless in the arms of the other lady, but for whose support she must havo lalien from the vehicle to tho ground. Miss Stretch herself showed signs of great prostration, and it was evidently by a strong effort of will only that she bore 1 up against tbo sickly faiutness which was ' oppressing her. If she should faint, Leo knew that his chances of escapo would be greatly reduced ; with two helpless girls on his bands and tho horsc3 to attend to much valuable time must be lost. "Be brave, Eval I depend on you! In fivo minutes we shall pass tho end of tho lagoon; then a short run will briug us to the punt. Onr horses are doing splendidly." As Leo predicted,' in five minutes the end ot the lagoon was reached, the fire being well .in tho rear ; bnt to his inexpressible chagrin, ho now discovered for the first timo that a minor wing of the fire had shot up the river in ad- vanco of the one he had been racing and was now much' nearer the puat than the refugees. There was one hope � one risky chance � the punt, a mile distaut, must be reached in ad vance of the fiames. The thing most bo done with a rush ; ono spurt, aud all would bo over I Leo stood up, grasped tho reins tightly, and flogged tho horses to the top of their speed. One minuto ! four ! the punt was 100. yards in front, the fire bitrely that distance to tho right. A lurch! a jolt I Tho black horse stumbled and staggered ; Leo dragged hint to his feet again. Auotlicr 50 paces, and then, dead beaten, tho black went down, with a heavy groan, his limp eyelids and quivering muzzle, in the dust ; he had done his best poor creature; be could no moro, Leo lopt to the ground. There was no time to reach tho punt now, but a bend in tho river's bank brought tbe water within 10 yards of them ; he drew the lifeless ladies from the buggy, and, taking otto in each arm, rushed forward' and plunged waist deep into tho stream.
