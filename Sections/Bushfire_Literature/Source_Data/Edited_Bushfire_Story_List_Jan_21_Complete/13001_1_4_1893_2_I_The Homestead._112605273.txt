 CHAPTER I. ? The Homestead. 

 * Well I declare that new manager is a Splendid fellow ; quite a treat to have him about the place.' ' I am indeed glad of that, and perhaps jiew, my dear, you will find time to take a little much-needed and weLL-earaed rest, Juice you have evidently secured a man Whom vou can trust.' 

 *' Trust ? Yes, indeed, I am confident t could trust Halyard with uncounted gold; he's the very soul of honor and has a head on his shoulders worth, any two or dinary men's.' ** That is a very high opinion you have ?f him, I hope he will always give you Season to retain it.' The epeakers in this conversation were Mj. George Wilmont andjhis wife. He was a well-to-do squatter, and a man of upright principles and integrity, respected by everyone who knew Mm, and loved, sin ceroly by his wife and family, which con sisted of a son and two daughters, all grown up. . Goorge .Wilmont had been one of the early : Queensland settlers, and had met with many difficulties and. losses in his first endeavors to succeed as a selector. He had emigrated when quite a young man full of health, strength and vigor, and fit for almost anything. The colonies were young and worETscarce. So he thought that if he were to invest his small capital in land and live stock he might manage to start a station on a small scale, and so work Mmself up the hill � if slowly, yet surely. But he was over sanguine, and did not count upon the many ups and *uowns hemust experience before lie should even be enabled to get back what he had laid out in hard cash, let alone put by foi & rainy day, or launch out on a largez scale. His selection was situated in the Bur afett district, and consisted of about 150 seres of well watered pasture land, excel. Xently adapted for grazing purposes. The town of Tiaro, which. Iky about 16 miles south, of Maryborough and 180 north oi Brisbane, was the nearest and most easy o! access. It being an agricultural township, and*%-eaufafully situated, made the pastoral districts of greater value. But Georga Wilmont found that a large amount oi physical endurance and perseverance wae required to start a station even on a small fleale. Dry seasons caihe, and the sheep and cattle died of thirst 5 then disease would seize his flocks, when they appeared . to be most healthy, and worst of all were �ha dangers he was often exposed to from tike fierce ravages of the bush fire, which destroyed all before it, leaving nothing but sv-eharred and blackened waste, where once grew and flourished green grass and fields of waving corn./ Twice had his station feats, barns, and stockyards also fallen vic tims to the ruthless destroyer, fire ; and 

 often almost in despair George Wilmont had nearly resolved to throw up the whole ?p*ing &n-l return to England thoroughly discouraged and disheartened at his want of success.- But his indomitable will persevered, and his strength of purpose txlnmphed over his difficulties, though they irexemany and severe. And at last his �Ssgt8 were erowned with sucoesa- And -sfhen the sun 'of prosperity deigned to ? ehine upon him. and enabledhim. to weather tha ?- storm* when** -he felt himwolf | ^j^sparad to( meet any fresh trial] ! y or Itrouble Which, might assail ~^SM^ !*� lie thought it was time to $aica .% fr fcimself a wife, for his life on the ?tataorf ^ w*s ^rerjr, lonely, and female society a ' ,- -suing almost denied him, !-J ^lengthie ^managed to taWajrunto ' 'Sfclsbaxie* land 'while there met a young j r lady ^who won his heart, sad who, he felt,: was the v one, end the only one,] ?\\ wltfi.* whom he could, �ha*e^Ma life.' , He eventually obtained the promise of her hand from her father,'aft�r wHo&Jfexe- � tiirne&-to^�he^�fati0n jand .madtfaztajgre : f mea^fcbont^ie erection of '-* anitafe)* I - hooxeBee&d, -fit for the, ^eeej^^oa jvf.

The pasture land around 1h.e house stretched to the very fdot of MQunt BoppT.e, and was therefore protected from 'the fierce westerly winds; Eventually wery thing was ready, and with a light heart George Wilmont proceeded to town to claim his bride. The marriage ceremony was performed in her father's house, and amid, earnest wishes for their future happiness from all, the pair departed for their new home. It was with mingled feelings of pride and joy that George. Wilmont installed his sweet young wife rn the home he had pre pared for her, and he felt that now he could surmount �ny obstacles while he had the consolation of her love. He had so long experienced the loneliness and dis comforts of single life on a station that he could thoroughly appreciate her refined ?ociety. . So time went on, and things prospered with the Wilmqnts ; and with prosperity also came the heirs to it in the persons of one son and 4: wo daughters, which were the joy and pride of their parents' hearts. Under Mr. Wilmont's personal supervision everything was well conducted ; he managed all his own affairs until his children were grown up, and his boy � the eecond eldest� had received a thorough education, and had returned home fully prepared (as the father thought) to take bis place in the management of the station* Maurice Wilmont was a fine young fel low of 20 years of age at the time our story opens, dark complexioned, and rather sun burned, with an open countenance and pleasant smile which won the hearts of all who knew him. He resembled his mother very much, his features being sharp and clear cut, and he gave promise of being a handsome man. His youngest sister Fanny more nearly re sembled him, but with a fairer complexion and hair of a lighter /hue. Yet it waB quite evident to the veriest stranger that the two were sister and brother, though their dispositions were distinctly opposite, for while Maurice was quiet and easy going Fanny was of a hasty temperament. Yet they were fast friends and.inseparable com panions. She had seen 18 summers, and was as rosy and fresh as a picture, and the pet of the household. But what of Beatrice � grave, sensible, thoughtful Beatrice � the hope and stay of father and mother \\, the one who could do anything and everything', from churning and baking to playing, singing, or sketch ing. Everyone depended upon Beatrice, her gentle face and '- quiet, manner won respect and admiration from all who came in contact with ,her. She was fair as & lily, with soft blue eyes, and a sweet, winning expression of countenance. Her wealth of light golden hair clustered in waving coils round her small and shapely head, and her face, ' when she smiled, seemed as though suddenly illuminated with a hidden light. Certainly Beatrice Wilmont was a sweet and lovely girl, yet so unconscious of her beauty and grace, a fact that lent an extra charm to it. She had just turned. 22, and was grave beyond her years. She resembled her father in complexion and disposition. Her fingers -were never idle, and her services and ad vice were constantly in demand � she was her mother's right hand in everything. Up to the time Maurice returned from school Mr. Wilmont had been obliged to have a} sort of under-manager on the sta tion, but he was so neglectful as to be more trouble than his ser vices were worth, and _ the squatter found that, as he had more than half the superintending to do himself, he might as well dispense with his services and do it all until Maurice would be ready to help htm* But when Maurice did come home hiaf father discovered that the boy was so full of life and spirits that it -would be some time before he would be sufficiently! sensible and steady -to take the entire management of the station on his own shoulders. Therefore he determined to make a trip to Brisbane and try to obtain. & man who he thought might suit him � one whom he could trust with full charge and entire confidence, and also one who would be competent to instruct Maurice in many little things-relating to agriculture. After about a fortnight's stay in Brisbane, Mr. Wilmont happened to meet with a young man who took his fancy, and who he believed would exactly suit him. Frank Halyard was a man of about 26 years of age, of a very dark complexion and jet black hair, which curled naturally over a high and intellectual forehead* He was above the average height, well built, and though not stout his frame was so well knit together that he appeared to be slighter than he really *wa&. He was rather handsome-� in faot so much so that Mr. Wilmont. thought twice before he decided to engage him. in case he should infatuate that irresistible Fanny j as for his Beatrice she waB proof against any thing like that he ^assured Idmself. She was too sedate to fall in Jove -with -a hand' some face. Halyard appeared to be a man who had seen better days 5 Ids ^aristocratic features and gentlemanly bearing bespoke noble lineage, and his polished manners, which shone from beneath the now roughened surface, told of a time when he was the idolised son of a doting mother. Jjrace and culture still lurked beneath the afecfMnfiiexionB of his dear voice, and the lamaU, ^shapely hand^ though mow much browned -by a tropical ? is|ra, told of their Ignorance o^toil?�nd41fre*jbanned face pre sented % striking conteast^o the whiteness of neck and arms, wMch the sun, had not browned.

But to '�&i& 1 intense gratification he finds that he actually asks Halyard for in formation, and is always grate ful , for it; in faot, hits taken a thorough liking to him, as they have all don�, girls inoluded. Fo* while Maurice finds in him a companion, Beatrice and Fanny feel that the evenings spent in. the large and comfortable drawing-room would be very * slow, and monotonous if they, were deprived of his company. For he can play and sing, talk well, and take a rubber at whist better than anyone of them. He can teach Fanny to paint from natural flowers j and on Sunday afternoons he will walk for miles in search of rare specimens, with all of which he takes real pleasure in explaining their different and peculiar qualities, and does it with apparently so much true knowledge of the subject that they cannot help feel ing interested in his explanation, and also gain information thereby. He is kind, thoughtful, and considerate to all, and in every way confirms their firmly-expressed opinion that ' Frank Halyard iia a thorough gentleman.' CHAPTER II. In Impromptu Meeting. it was a dark and miserable evening in July � a light rain was falling, and the usually clean streets of Melbourne were wet &nd slushy. Yery few pedestrians wore to be seen, and those who were out seemed! to have but one object in view, and that was to reach their respective, destinations in the shortest pos-i Bible time, for a cold and biting wind was driving the rain in every direc-t tion � now rising in wild gusts, and again sinking into a steady drizzle. It was at this time a young girl might have been seen vainly endeavoring to make her way through the wet and almost deserted streets. She was completely enveloped in a long dark cloak, which clung in damp folds round her slim form. On her head she wore a small sealskin cap, and carried in her arms a parcel, which she seemed to be anxious to protect from the rain, for she covered it carefully with her umbrella, at the risk of getting wet herself. � She hurried along heedless of every thing, with the seveTB wind and the un pleasant rain, driving in. her face. She did not observe that she had a fellow-traveller, who was evidently going in the same direction. He was a tall, distinguished looking individual, and carried himself with a free and naturally easy air, and was also well protected from the inclem ency of the weather by a thick overcoat which reached to his heels, while his hands were warmly gloved. They each pressed onwards, the girl's quick, short steps almost outvieing in speed the longer strides of her fellow-traveller* At length, just as she was about to cross the street, her feet slid from, under her, owing to the' slippery state of the curbstone, and she fell upon the wet and muddy pavement, uttering a little cry of fear as she felt herself going. In an instant the stranger waB by her eide and gently lifted her to her feet, recovering with difficulty the umbrella of which she had loosened her grasp to save herself when falling, and which the wind had carried far down the street. As he reached her side with the rescued property, he said, 'X hope, madam, you are not hurt ?' ' No, thank you,' she returned, ** only a little shaken j I am truly grateful for your timely assistance.' ' Don't mention it,' he answered, gal lantljr j 'lam glad I was near enough to help you. But I'm afraid your parcel has got soiled.' He added, � Allow me,' and taking it from her hand, he brushed with his handkerchief the mud from it, saying ' I think our roads lie in the same direction. By your leave I will carry this for you, and conduct you to the end of your journey,' �* I thank you very much for your kind offer,' returned his companion, ' but I fear I -will inconvenience you considerably. How shall I express my gratitude ?' '* By accepting the support of my arm, as the road is very slippery, and you must be weak from the effects of your fall,' he answered, proffering His strong arm for her acceptance. She took it without a word, except a glance into his face from beneath her long eyelashes, which the light of an adjacent lamp revealed to him, and which also showed him that she was rather pretty, though it was on a diminutive scale. Her face was small and oval, delicately moulded, and with large dark eyes over which drooped the long, curling lashes, and rested on the cheeks, which were very pale. Her figure was petite, and the hand which rested upon, his arm was no bigger than a child's. As they made their way against the wind (the rain having ceased for a time), they drifted into conversation. He began, � May I ask in what part of the suburbs you reside V* ** Z am going to St. E51da,' she replied. ' Indeed t My destination is not far from that place 1 but it is very late tor you to be out alone, and on such a night,' he remarked, � Yob,' she returned, � but I missed my 'bus, and thought it would be better to walk on than wait in the rain for ..another. I have been, taking home a dress to one of my customers, and was kept rather late fitting it.' ' Oh., indeed ! Then you ace alone in Melbourne, I presume F* : ** Yes, almost,' Aa ... replied quietly; ** except that I live.withanaunt and support anyee^by^in^a^edle^'-. ?;? ;----V' ;?-''?�? r- r Her unaffected manner, and .straignt f or wArd tone qiuOte won the admiration of her gallant escort, and when they arrived at the gate of her auntfe cottage, he determined that this should not be the last he would see of the pretty little stranger; ,So he said as he handed her the parcel and shook haaifi-rr**May � inquire the name of my fair companion?

But Frank Halyard had not found it miserable oi this particular night, for he had /been thoroughly interested in his chance acquaintance and he thought to Mmself aB he, strode' homewards, 'I must see her again, for she is indeed a pretty, innocent little creature. I am quite taken up with her.' Thinking thus, he reached his lodgings, where he was soon deep in his books and paper, and his pipe, with his ! slippered feet on the fender before a bright ! And cheery fire, and in his temporary en joyment for the time, quite forgot the event of the evening. But not so Dora Outhbert. She kept thinking over and over again of the hand - some stranger who had been her escort '? home that wet evening, and she looked j very often at the card which bore his name | and eaid to herself, 'What a very un- [ common and nice name, almost as nice as j its owner.' Dora Cuthbert was an orphan, and re sided with an old friend of her mother's* whom she called aunt. She supported her Belf by dressmaking, but though following that humble calling had once known better days, and was an accomplished pianist. Upon the death of her parents, being thrown upon her own resources for a j livelihood, she tried to gain a few musio j pupils, but, finding the demand much j greater than the supply, she abandoned the ! idea and took to her needle, with which she I was -very clever, and earned sufficient to j keep her in comparative comfort. She had taken home some work on this particular evening, and on account of some alteration j - which it required was detained very late, I and so met bj chance the courteous stranger, Frank Halyard. Time wore on, and the impromptu friends met very often. They soon became very i intimate friends, for Dora found that he \\ was becoming to her a part of her exist* ence and that she was almost miserable apart from him. But what about Halyard P He had en- j joyed the cheerful and pleasant -chats with ' Ma little friend, and had found the dull ; evenings pass pleasantly in her society ; ! but no thought of their being more than ' good friends ever entered his head, fox ; he was certainly not in love, yet he knew that he . -was playing - with fire, for Dora might not prove : so adamantine as himself. Thinking thus, he tried absenting himself from the cottage and making the evening strolls : shorter and fewer. But when he went again he found that his suppositions were ! only too true, for Dora looked pale and miserable, and when alone reproached him - sadly for his absence. j At last he made up his mind to tell hex that he must go away. They must sepa- ! rate, for he feared they might become more : than friends, and he had no intention of marrying. At this stern decree poor Dora broke down completely, and with bitter , sobs clung to Mm helplessly, asking him ; in tones of wild entreaty not to leave her now; 'that she could not live without : him � life would be miserable, unen- j durable.' j ?* Oh ! Frank,' she sobbed, ' you could i never be bo cruel aB to play with my ten- j derest feelings and then forsake me ? You I will not do �o, will you?' j ' Dora, little friend, I have' never spoken \\ of love to you,' he replied, tenderly stroking j her hair, and striving to soothe her grief, j At last after many ineffectual remon- ! strances with her he consented to remain, and the end of it all was, out of pure pity ! for her he � Frank Halyard � married her. ! Dora was well aware of the fact that Frank did not love her, but she was fully content to have the pleasure of lov ing Mm and of spending her life in Ms ; company. ', . So 18 months passed away, and Halyard ; had endeavored to do his duty to the girl he had married, and though the task was a hard and bitter one, he never allowed her to know it. But -what was still worse, he found that their tastes differed consider- | ably ; their thoughts, aims, and aspirations were entirely opposite. He was a deep and studious thinker, while she was shallow, : fond of gaiety and amusement, and at ; times fretful and peevish, though withal* I loving Mm devotedly, j At the end of this time, Halyard felt ; It -was absolutely impossible for hint to bear the yoke he had bound upon Ms neck any longer ; the sacrifice was far greatex than he had anticipated. 'I cannot en dure it,' he exclaimed to MmBelf ; ' I have tried to go through life and make the besi - of it, but I find it impossible. Now my Very existence is a burden, and I feel almost : buried alive,' , j 1 So one day, about the end of February, ! Halyard threw up Ms occupation in Mel bourne, and after leaving provision foi Dora to go on with, he took a steamer to Queensland. There h� arrived a stranger. After a short stay in Bris- ? bane, he received a position as sub- ! manager, or overseer, on a large station' near Dalby, where he remained for over two years. At length he- felt Mmself compe tent to take full management, and so it happened that he had but newly arrived in Brisbane when he saw Mr. Wilmontta advertisement for a competent manager, at a good salary, and answered it ; the result being, as our readers know, that he was engaged, and up to the present tame had even surpassed the expectations of his em- i ployer. ??-...' ? ' J He had never heard from Dora, but had j always sent constant supplies of money to i her. He wondered at her not seeking hisn ; but . he *? felt so relieved to lenow that he had burst the bonds, . and was in \\ a flense free, that ' he seldom gave her a thought, though1 sometimes a wave of regret would sweep ; over him, and he often breathed the wish that' they had never met. . *' I -wonder does she miss me, or grieve much at my desertion ?* he asked himself* f But, then, what else could I do P It wa� certainly better than allowing her to see �my misery, and feel the effects of my 'dis satisfaction. X only hope she will learn to forget me, and I wish it were in my powei to aet her free.' * - \\ , (to bb coniesob�.^;^- - An adaptation of the Jate .She-idanJae jlanu's powerful ^romance of rJ0&Bte$^J^M-^�#.
