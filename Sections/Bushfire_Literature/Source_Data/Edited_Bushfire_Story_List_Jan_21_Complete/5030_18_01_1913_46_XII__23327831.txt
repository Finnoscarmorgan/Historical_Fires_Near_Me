 CHAPTER XII.-(Continued.) 

 By "BULLOO." 

 Jim was seriously angry now, and get-<*> ting one arm free proceeded to box her ears soundly. At first she was surprised, but, remembering she had fought a hus- 

 band successfully once, pulled his head down and fastened her. teeth in bis ear. The attack was so sudden and unex pected that Jim uttered a startled "oh !" and perceiving mild measures were of no use compressed her windpipe until she let go, when he bumped her head on the ground until she was dased. But she had not been idle, and had used her spindleshanka with such effect that he was sore from the waist downwards. Nearly every soul in the camp had wit nessed the struggle, thfir risible faculties being aroused to such an extent that many rolled on the ground in aa agony of laughter. Jim stalked over to Yoorka, the blood streaming from his injured ear, snd cried, "You see how it is, if you persist in aaddling me with that she tiger I'll bolt and you can spear me, for I'll never be taken alive." While he was speaking a number of both sexes had gathered around, and as the chief was about to reply Oeera pounced on Jim from behind, nearly bearing him to the ground. She had sei�ed him by the hair, and- was shaking him vigorously, meanwhile yelling at the 'top of her voice. "My word this is too much," he growled between his clenched teeth, and picking up the writhing old mass of boa:s, he ran to the creek and flung her in bodily. Nothing daunted, Oeera endeavoured to scramble out, but Jim held her arid ducked her until from very fear for her life she sullenly submitted and swam away. He returned to his fire, and, kick ing her rug some distance off, sat down intending to remain there until soms one brought him food. - - He had not long to wait for Yoorka approached, bearing half a carpet snake and two duck's eggs, saying, "You're the first man or woman who has thor oughly conquered that old nuisance, Oeera. "She is so done up she Is allowing soms of the young gins to chaff her without retaliating. I have told her to build you a new gunyah near my own." "I won't allow her to do anything foC me," replied Jim angrily. "You had better consent, it's considered very undignified for a man to build his own gunyah. She won't trouble you after this. If you absolutely refuse te acknow ledge her you'll lose the protection which her claim upon you constitutes you a member of the tribe. "I'll have nothing to do with her." Yoorka had begotten a liking for the lad as the result of his spirited treat ment of the old gin, and resolving to assist him, said, "If old Oeera will give you up I'll try to get that young widow with whom she fought to claim you. She U good looking and a good worker. What do you say ?" Jim remained thinking for a few mo ments, and replied, "No, she might prove a bigger nuisance than Oeera. Leave it as it is, I don't think the old hag will trouble me much now. If she does I'll give her another dose." Gcera built a substantial gunyah for her scornful husband, lighted a fire near it, placed a coolaman of water close by, and seated herself a few yards away with her head on her breast. Jim walked over to her, and. ordering her off, took possession of his new premises. Most of the men departed on their usual hunting, but a few whosa larder was well Btocked remained in camp dos injr, or repairing tbeir weapons. Yoorka suggested Jim should practise throwing the spear and nulla, so that he would be able to procure his own food, but Jim hinted it would be a better plan to allow him to use one of tbs rifles. "No, replied the chief," with a laugh, "you might �Be it against us." "What could I do against you all," said Jim. "I wouldn't have a chance of getting away by myseK." "It can't be done,- bo there is no use disbursing it. I have brought you two spears and two nullas, take my &(dvice, go over there into the bush and do some practice ; no one will interfere with you." The lad sensibly obeyed tbe advice, and walking out of sight of the camp placed a piece of bark on a bush thirty yards away and began. He did not choose a treti for a target, as he would have pro bably damaged the spears. He was not by any means a novice with the weapons, for he had often thrown them on his father's station, and at the end of half an hour he was doing fairly well. ' He was kept in the camp for several 'days, and one afternoon Yoorka came to him, bearing some pieces of green gum bark, saying, "I saw you yesterday and you roade good practice at your target ; row you can try a running' shot with the nnllas." Standing about twenty yards away ?< threw a piece of bark, which, strikini the ground on its edge, bounded acrom Jin at about a pace a wallaby would ran, Jim threw his nulla, but did not 

 go within two feet of the target, though, after a score of shots, he struck one, �mashing it into pieces. "That's better," cried Toorka. "We'll have another try Jo-morrow, and if you shape well you can accompany me hunt ing." The second day's practice proved satis factory, and the following morning the strangely assorted pair left the camp together. Whether Jim was nervous, or that he had bad luck, or an admixture of both, he was very unsuccessful, and the chief rated him soundly after he had missed five consecutive shots with a nulla. If we reproduced Toorka's remarks on pidgin English, the reader would be shocked at the words he recognised and puisled with others, tor they were plen tifully besprinkled with oaths of the most vivid type, so we will rentier them, as usual, in ordinary English. "You are about the biggest duller it has been my misfortune to strike. You can hit a target and even a running on* fairly well, but directly you are taken out to kill your own tucker you can't hit a haystack. Why, dash it all, a flve year-old kid could do better. Well, th� long and short of it is if you don't pro vide for yourself in the future you can either jolly well starve or knuckle down to your lovely old wife. I won't worry myself any more about you." "Why can't you do. it like that ?" he continued, knocking over a kangaroo that was going at full speed thirty yards �way. 

 Jim was in � high state of indignation, and could have surprised the chief with his volubility, but mention of his unloved spouse cowed him, and he preserved a sulky silence. But the episode bad been of benefit, for with his next essay be killed a paddymelon. "There's supper anid breakfast, any how," he said, "you need not kill any thing for me until to-morrow." "Don't trouble yourself,," was the re ply. "I'd provide for you neither to morrow, nor any other day," replied the chief. Toorka then settled down to hunting for himself, and the lad could not but i admire his craftsmanship. Nothing ap peared to escape his eye. He detected . where a bandicoot had scratched up a root, and at a glance decided the traces i were an hour old and not worth follow i ing. He pointed to where a wallaby had ? Just left its form, and where an old man kangaroo had gone by in full flight pur k sued by dingoes. i "There's a bees nesi dose here," he i said, "and we'll find it." r "Look for it, you mean ?" said Jim, with a smile. I "Of course, we'll have to look for it," > replied the chief, missing the sarcasm, i "and we'll soon get it. That bee was I loaded and flew due south." ; He cut a blase on the south side of a i tree and walked south looking keenly up into any trees showing dead limbs. c "We've passed it, I think," be said, I clutching an insect resembling a small ? housefly, "but we'll soon see." 1 Extracting a few white hairs from the t possum skin fillet he wort round bia 

 forehead, he affixed them to the honey bs tween the bee's thighs and released it. The insect made a few circles in the air as if confused by its treatment and flew directly north, watched by the hunter's sharp eyes. "I think it belongs to the same nest as the first," said Yoorka, "and if so it's somewhere between us and the tree I marked." "Here we are," he continued, when they had covered about fifty yards, and, Pointing- up an ironbark, showed Jim where some bees, just distinguishable, were entering and leaving a small orifice. "Ouess you'll have a bit of a climb," remarked the lad. "It's twenty feet up to the first branch." The chief made no reply, but detaching a piece of bark from a hols on a gum tree handed it to him to hold. A few sharp blows of a tomahawk made a notch in the ironbark in which he placed a big toe, and holding on with the other hand hs made another incision a little higher up. This plan was con tinued until the first limb was reached, and the remainder of tbe operation was very easily accomplished. In a few minutes a square pises had been hacked out of the tree below the orifice, for his sharp ears told him the store was a little lower down. The in sects being perfectly harmless he plunged his hand into the comb and bringing out a fistful proceeded to eat it, then casually wiping his fingers on his thighs he scooped out more, dropping it into the coolaman Jim held to restive it, tell- 

 ing the lad to help himself freely. "I don't like honey," replied the lad mendaciously, adding to himself, "the dirty brute." The coolaman was placed in tbe fork of a tree and covered with boughs until they returned, for they, required more game. Two wfcllabies and an owl were added to the list and tbey beaded camp wards. They passed about a hundred yards to the left of where the honey had been cached and the chief said, "Where did we leave the honey ?" "Over there," replied Jim, "I was wondering if you had forgotten it. I'll get it." The chief was, in a small way, testing tbe lad's bushmanship and acknowledged the successful result with a pleased smile, for he hoped to wean him away from his own kindred and make a great warrior of him. He had little doubt of bis ulti mate success, for he could not understand how any young fellow could prefer work ing all day and every day instead of hunting and spending his time according to his inclinations. "I'll keep him under my own eye," he thought, "and make a friend of him. He �ill soon be able to kill his own food, and before long will take a young wife." Jim was also thinking of his future, but his plans were laid on very different lines to those animating the chief. "This is not so bad," he thought, "Yoorka is not half a bad chap, and some of the others are pretty decent for niggers, but I'm full of It, Their hab tvr\\ 

 1U are filthy and disgusting, and as for taking one of those creatures for a wife I'd sooner shoot myself. However, I've cot to make the best of it, and a chance of escaping will surely come soon, meanwhile I may discover the firearms and ammunition. I wonder if Harry has given me up for dead ? I don't think so. he won't give up until he gets abso lute proof I'm sure of that. If he finds my cap on the beach and that old dug out he may think I was drowned. Ah well, I'll hope for the best, and mean while I'll cultivate old Toorka." Time flowed on and as Jim did not hear of the presence of any whites in the dis trict be began to despair of being releas ed which meant, as far as he could judge, remaining with the savages tor years, and he saw no opportunity of es caping. In fact if he ran away where could he run to ? . There was no settle ment within hundreds of miles, so that he would be tracked down a day or two after he bolted, when he would be prob ably speared on sight. 80 he mochaai eally fell into many of the habits of the blacks. He had acquired a fine know ledge of their weapons and could . use spear and nulla as well as most of then, though he was not proficient with the boomerang ;he cowld throw it, but he never knew within fifty yards where it would stop. But it was not a generally useful implement, and he did not practise with it much. Old Geera still claimed him as her legal husband, and whenever the tribe shifted camp erected two gundies a short distance apart. Bhe did not attempt to ?apply him with the food generally, pro cured by the gins such as mussels, boug illlee. and various roots, for he had on one occasion pelted her with them, and she desisted. The lad became popular In the tribe, for his bright disposition prevented him from showing his real feelings, and three or four young fellows had exchanged the rite of blood brotherhood with him. He was Able to hold his own with them in spear and nulla contests at a target, while in running and jumping he was very super ior to their best men. He had not tried them in a long distance run, but could' give their champions a dosen yards in a hundred. Jumping, both running aad standing, was a new amusement for them, and their first attempts mere amusing, while their efforts at running hop, step, sad a jump nearly gave him a fit. A considerable portion of their time in the hot weather was spent in the water, and although, Jim could swim faster than they, at long diving they beat him easily. With the firm conviction they would be successful in rescuing Jim the three very dissimilar friends eagerly sought for traces of the lost lad, gradually widen ing their field of inspection until they discovered the creek. "Here's where they've gone to a cer tain ty," cried Harry, "we'll soon find their tracks now. I expect they've land ed on the other side. Anyhow we'll soon ascertain." Their hopes of finding Toorka's tracks were, however, quickly dispelled for, on crossing the creek they found a bush fire had swept the country for miles. This did not quench their ardour, for they concluded the chief ignited the grass to obliterate his tracks, and following Pom pey's advice headed due South which would, if persevered in, lead them back to the island. Pompey felt sure Toorka would return to one of the most favour ite camps, and as Harry could find no argument to combat his views, he fell in with them. They camped on a range, for Harry was so eager to press on he insisted upon the party travelling till dark. "What does it matter if we go without water for one night, we can easily reach it in the morning. We can't go on after dark, for we might miss the very tracks we're looking for," he said. They had passed through the bmnt country, and as mile after mile was trav ersed and no fresh tracks were discovered Harry began to think they had ma-ie a mistake, and calling a halt under a huge spreading epala expressed his doubts. "I'm afraid we're wrong," he said, "We haven't seen a fresh track, and as we've marked the line crossways as well I'm beginning to think our time is being wasted. But what other line are we to take ?" "That's-Just it," said Pompey. "He is more likely to go this way than any other. I think we should go as far as the lake before we turn back. Even if Yoorka is not there some other persons may be from whom we could gain useful information." "What do you think, Ah Choo ?" "No flndee trackee no goodee. No can think." "Tour advice doesn't amount to muct then, so I suppose we'd better stick to Pompey's opinion." Early in the afternoon as they ap proached a small creek Pompey's quid ears detected voices, and while the oth*n� halted crept forward when he discovered two men bathing. Rejoining his mates he said, "I know those men, they belong to the tribe that �old me to Toorka's people. One of them is my blood brother, so I think I bad better speak to them." Harry raising no objection he waited until the strangers had left the water when he uttered the wbeedling cry of the 

 small squirrel and, though hidden, watth ing bis friend carefully. The squirrels are ooeturaal animals, so that both blacks started oa hearing the sounds. �Again the soft querulous cry went forth, and the younger of the two replied with the answering cry. Had the sounds been heard at night, even a blackfellow would have been deceived so natural were they. The private signals were again exchanged, and the frfends bounded for ward to meet one another.
