 CHAPTER XIV ^WELCOME HOME. . 

 A dense haze lay on the coast of New South Wales, and was blown far oufe to sea, and the Glen Ora groped her way along for the entrance to the Lake: A whole year had gone since she sailed away, ? and the hot winds and bush fires of the late summer now swept/the land, making life a misery and wiping put for the time 

 the beauties natural to^this part of the coast. Donald Eain, reared amid the everlasting snows of the Scottish High lands, felt the awful heat acutety, and as day followed day, with that choking wind filling his luDgs and the smoke of burning vegetation hiding the shore, the old man began to have grave doubts as to whether the climatic conditions were going to pan out altogether satisfactorily. He hinted to Cameron more than once that his Aus tralian property had in all probability gone up in smoke long ago, and added the opinion ' If this iss the nat'ral condee 

 shin o' the weather in Austreelay it'll pe tampfc little loss.' Cameron, of course, assured the old man that the season was not favorable � the heat of the summer must have been abnormal, he said, and the bush fires were adding to the heat. But that he had no fears as to the ultimate safety of the coun try. A general iucicerafcion was impossible, he asserted, but all wearing apparel would doubtless have to be discarded for the next few months. ' We have often to do this in the summer,' he added, at the same time winking to the others near. ' Eh ? Whaafc wass that ?' yelled the Highlander. ' Ye wass no1 wea1 ony . claes ava ?' ' Well, no � that is to say, nothing heavy or cumbersome,' said Cameron. ' A string of coral beads round the neck, or a couple of feathers in one's hair are sometimes worn, but anything heavy is out of the question. You see, Donald, in ! Scotland you ran about with the lower extremities uncovered, but here we go one better. We come out in the all togefher.' 

 ?' Weel, noo, ah'U tell ye whaafc, Mister Cameron,' yelled Donald excitedly, ' her nainsel wull no' go apoot naked, an' she'll alloo noe man apoot her t?e go naked- � an' petter nor that, she'll belt hell' oot o' ony man as tries it.' ' Oh, if you take it like tha,t,' remarked Captain Wishart apologetically, ' I sup: pose we can make some little changes in our habits to meet the case. However, yonder's the inlet to the heads, gentlemen, so we will soon be home. Now then, lads ! � three hearty cheers . for Australia Fair, and another for Castle Cameron. We know there are many warm hearts 

 waiting to welcome us inside yonder gap.' The cheering rang out heartily -over the waves and was answered from the shore by the loud reports of Donaldson's couple of signal guns, which had evidently been dragged to a promontary overlooking the entrance and there mounted. From a flagstaff near this point the voluminous folds of the national banner of Australia gradually floated out on the breeze, and loud over all rang the skirl of the High land pipes. Soon midget forms could be seen clustering here and thereon the cliffs, and little white daubs showed where handkerchiefs were being waved. Closer in yet, the faint buzz as of cheering was borne to the ship, and then as the Glen Ora swept into the channel and through it, it was seen that the entire population of Rocky Point was on the shore waiting to welcome the wanderers home. Smartly now the schooner ran up to her moorings at the end of the bay, where she 

 was soon secured. A boat dropped along side almost at the same instant and pulled away for the landing, and out of this stepped Cameron, his lovely bride, and the venerable Donald Bain ; as also some others � lesser lights connected with our little story. Corporal Donaldson advanced four paces towards Cameron, halted, squared his heels, and smartly saluted the group of which he was one, and brusquely an nounced ' Have to report all well, sir ! Splendid health in the settlement, good discipline among the men, and three nevy babies arrived � not to . mention some 

 picaninmes. . ' Ah ! Very, good, Donaldson (shaking him by the hand heartily). My wife, Donaldson. Mr Donald Bain, her father; and � ah � Miss McDonald. Yes, I am married now, corporal', and done for. See that you take a warning from my fate � aha! � the advice comes a little late though.' ' '' v ' Ah, God bless the sweet lady � wish I may never ! � welcome to Australia, Mrs Cameron. Grand country, best in the world ; hope you'll have every happiness ! . . , . Squad! (this to the grinning ranks of the ' Black Milita.'1) 'Form fours, by your right ! Forward, march ! . . . . We shall now escor.t you to the castle, sir � and ladies. Oh. I tell you this will be a grand day at Castle Camer on when they see the new missus.' Donaldson was getting . excited, also slightly incoherent, with gladness, and Flora's eyes filled with tears of happiness as she realised the wealth of love the people had for her husband, and their warm welcome of herself. Yes, she was going to be happy here � oh, so happy and content ! Those people, because of their love for Cameron, would be her people ; their land her land, and she would devote her life to helping them on. They would make an ideal com munity by this lovely lake and would ? ' Tid ye eefer get yer een on sic droll lookin' deils ass they plack sotchers, Flora? Whaat are thae ava? They're a wee bit like 79th men, but only a wee bit. Py ta lort a canna maak them oofc ava.' ' Hush, Donald. Don't let the men hear you,' whispered Cameron, as the procession moved on. *' Those are all good Highlanders � McGregors mostly � but the climate has played the deuce with their complexions.' 

 ' Hedanfcmen ! Macgreegors ?' Don ald's jaw dropped as he gasped out the words and a fishy look came into his eyes. ' An' wull her nainsel get like yon birkies tae?' he asked. ' Wull she haff to use some 0' that 'climate' ye speak o?' ??' 'Oh well, that will be as you please,' replied Cameron. ' It. helps one in the hot weather, you : know/ but it plays Old Harry with one's skin. However, you can decide as to whether you will use it later.' ' No, put she can teside this meenit ! She can say noo that if ony man � or ony woman � comes near her with the tamp test little bit o that stuff, shell dirk her 0/1 ta s'riot Na,1 na. Nane o' yer tamped plackamoor stuff fur Tonal � an' dinna forget it!' 'And still muttering in fierse protest the indignant old Highlander strode on and, along with the others, entered Castle Cameron, the Australian home of our hero. Flora was,- naturally, much interested with everything she saw. Even at this unfavourable season of ihe year: her new home looked enchanting, and the situation appealed to her as being all that was picturesque and romantic. It was a bit from her native Highlands, only not so wild and gloomy, yet she at once saw, as 

 had Cameron years before, the strong re semblance to faraway Loch Lomond and the ancient castle of 'he Campbells. Don ald Bain even saw this-, and was gener ous enough to admit that 'the castle's noo that ill ava � in a smaa, gingerbreed kind o' way, ye ken ; put ye could steal a' there is o't and ne'er miss it oofc o' Cassel Campbell.' ' It is a beautiful home, father, and vou will soon learn to love it,' replied Flora. 'Just look at those glorious flowers; geraniums, fuchias, pelargon iums and � oh, hosts of other rare blooms � all growing in the open. Ah, Angus, this is more lovely than I had ever dreamed it. I do not wonder you longed to be back to all this.' ' Dearest, ' all this ' would have been as nothing to me henceforth had not you been here to share it with me. True, I was content and even happy in this place before I met you. After that no place on earth would have interested me in which you were not.' 

 11 There iss no' a smkle Schotch thussel in the hale tamped gairden,' growled Donald morosely. ' Plenty o' plasted roses ant ither English truck, but oor ain bonnie thussel's no' tae pe seen.' But Cameron was soon able to allay the discontent of the ancient Highlander over the absence of his national flower. In fact Cameron had actually brought out with him several packets of seed of the awful pest, and to this present day the agriculturists of that region take'off their hats and speak with deep feeling when they refer to ' the bally egiot that fust planted that 'ellish thing in Haustraliar.' Well, fortunately, our hero was not the first, so the remarks can have no relation 

 to him. The new arrivals found that a great reception had been prepared for them at the Castle Mr Marshall, who had supervised the estate in the master's absence, had everything in readiness, and all that night the halls of ' Camer on's Folly ' rang with music and laughter, and the sounds of dancing feet. Residents of the Lake, and even some from Newcastle, were present in great numbers to welcome home the happy bridal pair. And the 'sword dance,' by Mr Donald Bain, was long remembered as a particularly exhilirating item of the joyous occasion. To be continued.
