 CHAPTER V. STONEHAM'S GADFLY. 

 They had great faith in Stoneham, partly on account of his mysterious sailing craft ; but mostly by reason of his great nature and reckless daring. They credited him with being able to accomplish any matter which he 

 took seriously in hand, and from time im- memorial their oldest and wisest men had talked in secret conclave about the mysterious path which lay somewhere towards the setting sun.   Stoneham meant if possible to satisfy both himself and them, and after years of waiting had at last pitched upon Sir Charles Dawson and Captain Buchanan, as two men likely to serve his purpose on such an expedition, and the least likely to be missed if some untoward accident should overtake them before their return. It had been no part of his plan for Hartley to go with them. The two English men, the two blacks, and himself (he had settled in his own mind) would be ample Hartley's going upset everything ! Stoneham had arranged that night to meet Buchanan somewhere near the Boat Passage and receive from him the gold coins and dia- mond, which were to be returned to the chief of the tribe, and also make final arrangements about meeting Sir Charles and Buchanan three weeks later somewhere on the Barcoo. He was in a bad temper however, for it was that very day he had first heard that Hartley proposed to form one of the party. And there was something else wrong between himself and the Captain. It was nearly a mile by the windings of the creek from Smoke Island wharf to the Bay. Nine o'clock had struck when the Gadfly cast off and moved slowly down stream. Stoneham was steering and three of the girls, who formed the crew, were busy forward getting everything in readiness to make sail upon the boat when Stoneham gave the order. They wore woollen guernseys and short skirts and trod with their bare white shapely feet noiselessly about the deck, They had dark oilskins and south-westers handy to put on when the thunderstorm, which was now growling ominously in the south west, should break upon them. It was evidently going to be a rough night, The craft, which was being skilfully navi- gated clear of rocks and sandbanks by Stone- ham, was about eight or ten tons and of rakeish build. She was now propelled at half speed by the electric engine, and moved almost noiselessly through the water. It was noticeable that everything about her was painted dark brown, except that she was white below the water line ; but being fitted with water ballast compartments could be sunk on occasion, so that only the darker colours were visible. Her sails, too, were tanned brown, and as she moved down the creek not a patch of white was anywhere visible about her. At the distance of a few hundred yards on a dark night she might have passed anywhere unseen. As they swept past a mangrove island and crossed over to the other side of the creek to escape a sandbank, the Bay suddenly opened upon them.. 'Haul down that jib,' said Stoneham. The   sail came down immediately without any flap- ping of canvas or the rattle of a ring bolt. It was evident that everything worked smoothly on the Gadfly. Stoneham was going to lie to at the mouth of the creek, under the shadow of the man- groves. He had caught the sound of a paddle steamer going south and had decided to let her pass before making sail. She had both masts stepped. He was seemingly taking unusual precautions. 'It should be explained that the yacht was   arranged to be sailed with either one mast or two, and only at night when extra speed was wanted she was fitted and rigged as at present. When carrying only one mast as she ordinarily did when used by daylight, She would never have been taken for the same craft as that which had scared half the night toilers about Moreton Bay. Stoneham lit his pipe and sat down on the stern rail, while the girls sat or lay about the deck forward; they had each had a cup of strong coffee before starting, so there was nothing to do in the galley, or elsewhere, and they sat and talked in whispers, and looked out into the night. 'What an awful big weird place the Bay   looks when it is dark,' said Alice to Dorna, just above her breath. They spoke very quietly, for the least sound was heard on such a night for a very long distance. Between the muttering of the thunder down in the south-west, which was, however, rapidly drawing nearer, everything was as still as the grave � save for the beating of the stern paddle-wheel of the steamer. She was still a couple of miles away, but from the distinctness of the sound she might have been only a cable's length off. Two white ghostly objects were noticed by the girls moving steadily up the creek, in perfect silence, under the mangroves on the other side. They were a couple of pelicans going up to a favourite fishing bank of theirs. Things were evidently very quiet for the birds to move along like that. Dorna put her hand on a double-barrelled breach loader for a moment, and whispered her belief that she could bring them both down with one shot ; but there was no sound save the lapping of the waters against the side of the Gadfly, and the sighing of the approaching tempest in the tops of the trees, and the beating paddle-wheel of the steamer, or the splash of an occasional fish as it leaped up and then fell back into the water. There were n few lights visible on the main land, and one or two on the islands far distant in the Bay � bush fires probably, most of them. For another quarter of an hour the silence was unbroken, for Stoneham rarely spoke to the girls except to give orders, and as usual sat wrapt in meditation and tobacco smoke. Soon, however, the steamer had passed south. 'Set the fore sail and spanker.'   The yacht, as we have stated, carried two   tall masts that night, but so rigged that the second could if necessary, be easily unshipped. Both masts carried large square lug sails, and spankers with top sails. It was easy to see 

 that the Gadfly had been built for speed. With the propeller at full power she could show her heels to any craft upon the Bay ; in fact walk round and laugh at them. She was soon bowling along at a great rate with the white foam heaped up in front of her bows, and an eddying wake behind, for it was nearly high water, and although Stoneham was keep- ing fairly in shore he knew that there was plenty of water everywhere and no risk of running aground ; she was making at least fourteen knots. The moon was hanging low down in the west, but the stars were bright in front of them and they could see that the bank of clouds, which was now rapidly sweeping up in their rear, formed a very curious spectacle. The back-ground of the sky was black as ink ; but stretched right across, from horizon to horizon, was a great bridge or bow of white clouds. The chain and forked lightning flatbed brilliantly at the back of it and re- flected occasionally through it like the flash- ing of opals ; but the white bridge of vapour showed no perceptible movement for several minutes as though it was fixed across the sky. Then there came a brilliant flash which lit up the whole Bay, and a peal of thunder   quickly followed and the fantastic creation melted before the pent up fury of the storm.
