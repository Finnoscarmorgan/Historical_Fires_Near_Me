 Leaving my place I tramped to Laun- ceston, where I took up my abode at a boarding-house, and soon got acquainted with the daughter of the owners, and was often in her company. This coming to the knowledge of her parents, I was forbidden 

 to hold any communication with her, and, as I was closely watched I for a time had no opportunity of meeting her. One night, however, I managed to take her to Ash- ton's Circus, and it was then arranged be- tween us, without the slightest thought of impropriety, that I should go to her room at night and wait for her, as she would be the last of the family to go up- stairs. I left my boots below, and, not being acquainted with the run of the house, I entered what I thought was the girl's room. I saw   women's dresses hanging about, and so made certain that I was right, and sat down on the bed. In about an hour I heard the steps of two people on the stairs, and, fearing that they might for some reason, enter the room where I was, I crept underneath the bed. To my horror the footsteps stopped at the door I had mis- takenly entered, and in the next second the girl's father and mother came into the room! It was their room! They un-     dressed. They knelt down by the bed under which I was lying, and said their prayers. They got into bed. I heard them, talking about how to prevent me meeting their daughter. I lay in an agony of fear, sweating at every pore. I lay for half an hour, and then I was seized with a violent fit of hiccough. Do what I would I could not restrain it, and at last, giving one awful gasp, I rushed from my hiding place and made for the door. The father, however, proved too quick for me. He jumped from the bed and was upon me before I could open the door. With the help of his wife who had followed him, he held me tight and shouted for help, no doubt thinking he had caught a burglar. After much struggling I got out of the room, and to the landing at the top of the staircase, the two still clinging   to me. Finding I could not get free without doing them some harm, I threw myself down and the three of us rolled together to the bottom. When I got loose I quickly regained my feet and rushed for the back door opening into the yard. I unlocked it, and got out, thinking that the only way of escape was a low place I knew of in the wall. I made for it; but there I found a   big dog chained to his kennel. I jumped   on the kennel, and laid hold of the top of the wall just as the dog laid hold of the seat of my breeches. I got away by a des- perate wrench, but only to fall right into the arms of a passing constable, who 

 marched me off, barefooted as I was. Rounding a corner I gave him the leg in the true Lancashire style, and left him rolling in the gutter; while I made down   to the wafer's edge on the road to Port Sorrell, where I lay in hiding all that day, and at night went to a shoemaker's in Launceston, and bought myself a pair of boots. Just at this time I obtained my certificate of freedom, without which I was liable to be at any moment apprehended, and again turned in. I next started down the coast to Port Sorrell. On the road I met with an old shipmate, named Jack Downes, who was acting as a constable, to whom I related my adventures and mishaps. I got from him a pair of trousers to replace those I had on, which had been torn in my struggles. Downes, moreover, told me that down the river, at Circular Head, a great deal of paling splitting was going on, and that, by applying to a Mr. Gib- bons, I might get into a job, and ultimately have a chance of going to Melbourne in one of Gibbons's timber ships, which would be better than going back to Launceston, where I might get into trouble. Downes said he only wished he had my chance ; but he was a lifer. He then gave me a billy can, tea, sugar, and bread and cheese. When I asked him how much I owed him, he said he would only charge me for the cloak, as that was not his, and he would have to pay the owner. He only asked   me ten shillings, which I gave him. 

 Trudging along, I overtook quite a young looking lad�about fifteen or sixteen�and       found he was, like myself, on the way to Circular Head. He proposed that we should go mates. We tramped along the coast till dusk and camped by a hollow log. I told him of my narrow escape, and that I did not wish to be seen by the police. He replied that if I would promise not to tell he would let me into a secret. I gave him   the pledge he asked, and he then told me that she was a bolter from Hobart. He implored me to assist him in getting to Circular Head, near where his family lived. He then went on that he had been about the neighborhood where we were many times, and knew the road well; that there   was a police station at the Mersey River, of which we must keep clear; and that as   we were camped near the river we could start early and wade across the bar before the police were about. Early the next morning we sighted the 

 station and saw men going and coming. Upon this we went back and camped again. The following morning we started at dawn   and waded into the river. I got a stout stick, and went first holding my com-   panion's hand. After we had gone some   distance I told him to get on my back as the current was very strong and his weight would steady me somewhat. He did as I told him, and we soon got over and travelled on to the next river, the Leven, which we had to cross in the same fashion to reach Gibbons's timber yards. I found the stream very strong here also, and my mate could not stand against it. I told   him the only way was to swim until we   got to shallow water. I pulled off my shirt, and said that if he would give me his I would carry the things on my head, and that, if he would stick close to me, we would manage.   He hesitated, and I asked him if he were frightened of the water, and if he could swim. He hummed and hahed for some time, and then said he did not like to tell me before, "but I am not what I seem. I am bolting from the factory. In fact I am a girl." I in- duced the girl to trust herself on my back, and by going a short distance out I managed to reach a shallow part of the bar, and soon landed safely on the other side. When out of sight of the water we had 

 some tea, and then, as I knew her secret, she seemed anxious to be off, so we parted, she promising to come and see me again if I got work, I never, however, saw any- thing more of her. I went up the river to Gibbons's saw pits, and there saw a fine military-looking man, who engaged me to draw palings. He was to find a horse and cart, and rations, and give me half the profits. I worked steadily here for some time, sleeping at night on a stretcher in the store. The first night of my sojourn I was startled almost out of my senses by the appearance of a tall gaunt figure hold- ing in one hand a lighted candle and in the other a drawn sword. The figure flourished the weapon about, and went vigorously through the broadsword exer- cise. It (or he) then sheathed the sword, and, drawing forth a pistol of tremendous size, advanced straight towards me, cutting all sorts of capers. Feeling certain that I was in the presence of a madman, and a dangerous one, too, I made a bolt from the store. Next morning I told the rail- splitters of what had happened, and said I was so terrified that I had determined to leave. They laughed at the idea, telling me to take no notice of "the old man," as   he was quite harmless, and interfered with no one. On this I stayed, hoping to save enough money to carry me to Ade- laide, where I told my employers I had relations. 

 CHAPTER II.�THE MAINLAND.     My employers offered to let me have a freight of palings. The captain of a small vessel bought some of this off me, and I loaded some more on my own account,   which he offered to land at Adelaide, and take as freight half it would fetch at public sale. I agreed to this, and went on board just before the vessel weighed anchor. Ships leaving the river had, as a rule, to report at the Heads, where they were searched for prisoners. We, however, escaped this scrutiny, and, after an unevent- ful trip, arrived at Port Adelaide. We unloaded, and I sold the palings at 22s per 100. Their cost price had been 3s 6d, so I put between �30 and �40 in my pocket. Being now in funds and light of heart, I rode up to Adelaide, about seven miles distant, and took up my abode with a man named Bill Monks, in Light Square, near the Billy Barlow. I knocked about for a fortnight, seeing all I could and noting the difference between a penal settlement and a free colony. I then thought it time to look for work, and went off to Gawler Town, on the Burra Burra road. I had no success there, and returned to Adelaide, where, through meeting with a young girl, I fell in for a slice of luck. I had agreed to take this girl out for a drive in the country, and for that purpose went to a livery stable to hire a trap. The man with whom I spoke told me I could get a turnout for the day by paying a de- posit of ten pounds, and to this I agreed. When I came for the trap it was a wretched ramshackle affair with a worn out horse. I asked to see the master of the place, and, when I was shown in to him, I recognised him as an old pal in Van Dieman's Land. He at once greeted me, told me that his men had 

 taken me for a sailor and let me a con- veyance specially kept for them, but that I should at once have a better. Accord- ingly I was able to drive in style along the Mount Barker road as far as Hands- dorf or Germantown. Upon my return the livery-stable keeper, a Mr. C��, reminded     me of the days when we had worked to- gether at fencing at Kemp's Lakes, and he had shared the sucking-pig with me, and helped me to pass off a bandicoot for a pig upon our master. He told me that by hard work he had risen from, groom and stable help to his present position, and had a good business with postcarts, omnibuses, funeral turns out, and besides landed   property. He declared he would never forget my many kindnesses to him, and, as he was now well off, offered me any assis- tance he could give. If I had liked I could have had employment from him in driving a springcart for passengers to and from Port Adelaide. He also said that he could get me a situation with his friend Mr. Chambers, the principal mail contractor, who had the overland mail to Melbourne, and he would be my bondsman. I told him I would prefer this, as I should like to see something of the country, and it was arranged that I should put up with him while he was making arrangements with Mr. Chambers.
