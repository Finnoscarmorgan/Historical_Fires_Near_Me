A Love Story. 

 (Continued.) 

 The still atmosphere of this house- hold, its peace, its aloofness from all the bustle of life, had taken posses- sion of the girl, and as she lay in bed and saw that she must pass on out of this resting-place, her heart re- belled. 

 She was a fierce- tempered creature,   and she thought, 'I must stay here for a time, even if I have to become a housemaid.''' The work would not be difficult, and she could wait a month here until she saw her way clear, again. She felt the need of a pause in her life. She must let the current of life flow by for a space. She could face no more decisions; she would drift awhile�it     was so easy. Then she turned over luxuriously in bed and slept easily till breakfast time.       That morning she became housemaid at Ngarahoe Station. Work kept her busy all that day. After the tea-things had been washed up there was a pause. She looked up with a stifled yawn. 'What do you do in the evenings, Polly ?' she asked. '' 'Uh, sometimes I go over to the men's quarters. There's a married couple there, and some of the boys are very jolly. There's Jim, he plays the accordion beautiful, and the head shepherd is great on the flute Jessie stared. 'Is that all?' she   asked, at last. 'Don't you find it slow?'   'Slow? Oh, no. You see, we don't sit up late, and at nine o'clock there is prayers.' 'Prayers!' All the girl's soul was   suddenly in revolt. How long was it since she had been to church ? 'But it isn't Sunday' she said. 'No, of course not, silly,' laughed Polly. 'The 'boss' has prayers every night.' 'What, for all of us ?' 'Of course. We all go into the din- ing-room.'   Jessie considered. ' Well, I won't go.' Polly smiled. 'Oh, yes, you will. It'll be something to do.' Really, that evening was very slow! Jessie thought with a sigh of a cer- tain oyster-supper of the evening be- fore she left Christchurch. The only break in the monotony of the evening was a visit from Jim. He strolled over from the men's quar- ters, he explained, to see Polly. Jessie thought the explanation superfluous. Jim turned out to be the lean young horseman she had met in the paddock. By the light of the kitchen lamp she noticed that he had shaved, and there were unsuspected lines of strength about his mouth. She almost thought in good-looking. On, that point Polly had no doubts. But his convert- sation ! Jim's horizon seemed to be bounded by the run. His world held nothing but sheep and cattle. And his remarks were few and ruminative. He seemed to have relapsed into the pla- cid mental attitude of a cow. When at last he left, and Polly, with a blush that made her red cheek purple, slipped after him 'to say good- night,' Jessie's one thought was of pity for the obvious contentment of these two with their narrow environ- ment. Polly returned and lapsed into a silent contentment. Jessie's nerves be- gan to revolt. It was with a sense of relief that she saw Mrs. M'Gregor en- ter the kitchen with the remark that they would now have prayers. Jessie arose with alacrity and fol- lowed her mistress and Polly into the dining-room. The 'boss' sat in his great arm- chair, spectacles on nose, selecting a chapter from the big Bible. To-night he was very sleepy after a long day in the saddle, and he was looking for a chapter that was short. His wife had pushed away her work and sat, hands folded in her lap, upon the so- fa, keeping a watchful eye the while on her husband to see that he did not fall off to sleep. The reading be- gan. Jessie paid no attention to the words, yet they seemed to fall quietly on her heart. There was a long prayer after, in the middle of which she won- dered with a sudden pang how she could possibly put up with this cere- mony every night. When she got into her bed that night, she said softly to the bed clothes, 'Good Lord !'' Put the tone was not one of prayer. Before she blew out the candle, she caught sight of a text on the wall at the foot of her bed. It said some thing about giving rest, to evil who were weary and heavy-laden. 

 Then she turned over and went to sleep. III. It must be remembered, in the con-   sideration of Jessie, that it is impos- sible for one to execute a great sacri- fice without regrets. The excitement   of her first resolution had waned. The   aftermath, of depression was here, and Jessie chafed under the pettiness of this new life. It was to cover this period that she began to flirt with Jim. Really there was no one else to flirt with, and he took to the process with such avidity that Jessie began to get a certain amount of amusement out of his earn- estness. Besides, it appealed to her pride to be able to hold in utter sub- jection such a splendid specimen of physical manhood. At times Jessie had qualms about Polly, for Jim had had apparently forgotten her exist- ence ; but Polly's calmness of demean- nour was too natural to conceal a breaking heart. And Polly wrote as- siduous letters to a certain Henry re- siding at Mungannahu, and in return received bulky envelopes masculinely and laboriously addressed, and mark- ed with the Mungamahu postmark. Jessie decided to let things run their course. And Polly's cheeks did not lose their red. After a month at Nga- rahoe, Jessie found herself steadily growing into the life of the place. Of an evening Jim, would wander into the kitchen on a dozen different pretexts, and sometimes Jessie would go to the door 'to say good-night.' But he never ventured to be anything but la- boriously polite. He stood in utter awe of her, and Jessie was content to keep him so. In the warm, moist cli- mate of 'the garden of New Zealand' her face began to glow faintly, her figure to fill out to its accustomed curves. Her eye was brighter, her step brisker. The tale she had told of her past was that she had been a lady's companion, who had lost her situa- tion. The stage-life was very far away now. One Sunday afternoon, Jim persuad- ed her to go for a ride with him. They rode in silence across the pad- docks, over the rich river-flats where the cattle stood belly-deep in bush grass, along willow-shaded tracks be- side the brown-hued stream, beneath patches of bush, up hillsides covered with manuka-scrub where startled sheep wheeled from the shade. Wild peacocks called weirdly from the briar- patches, and wild turkeys stalked, clucking, with their inquisitive brood. Once they saw a dazzling white pea- cock strut, in his silver, against the dark-green hillside. Tuis called from the forest and the Australian magpie answered with his cheerful note. Jim was at his best on horseback. Jes- sie covertly admired the sweep of his muscular limbs. He talked, too, free- ly, telling her the ways of his sheep and cattle. How this herd was fatten- ing off, already purchased for the free- zer, and these were kept for breeding. He told her, too, of himself. He was a New Zealander, born in Oamaru. He had been all his life on farms, but had moved over nearly the whole of the two islands ere he had came to Ngarahoe. Now he had saved some money. 'You know,' he said, 'a fel- low can't spend much in the country, unless he goes too often to the public house.' Now he had enough to get a lease of a small place of his own. He had his eye on a likely place. It was only a small sections of bushland, a few hundreds of acres, but in two years he could clear it and sell it at a good profit, he reckoned. But there was something nearer at hand for him. The married couple at the men's quar- ters were leaving, and the 'boss' had told Jim he could have the place. Now, if he were only married � Jessie hastily asked him the name of the hill their horses were slowly climbing. He told her, and after a glance at her face relapsed into sil- ence. At last they reached the top of the ridge. Before them as they dismount- ed lay Ruapehu in all the glory of his triple peaks, rising silver -white above the far-stretching folds of purple bush. To the west, a great pillar of cloud stood solid in the afternoon sun � a bush-fire in the ranges beneath. A great awe came upon the girl. About them was the hush of the high solitude. She and Jim were alone in his world of purple-robed ranges. The whole land was covered with a pall of silence. As far as the eye travelled, there was no sign of man, no smoke stirred up to the heavens, even that shut cloud in the west was so far off that it seemed motionless and solid.   The bush and the mountains had this world to themselves.   She turned to the man at her side with a sudden impulse of companion- ship. 'It frightens me' she said. (To be Continued.)
