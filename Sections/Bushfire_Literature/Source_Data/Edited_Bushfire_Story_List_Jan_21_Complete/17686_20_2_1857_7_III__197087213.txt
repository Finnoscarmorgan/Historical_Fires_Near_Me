pGK TOM THE BUSHRANGER. ' 

 , A . TALE . OF TWENTY YEARS AGO. '

 CHAPTER in. 

 IVhen Walter Burton joined the party around the bush fire, Fighting Dick had kept back, actuated by a pardonable mo- <ioat.v. which frequently assailed him in 

 file presence of members of the constabu lary force. The fact was, that although an excellent stockman, and strictly honest fl3 regarded his paster, there were some little transactions with respect to "Roosbians" on the hills, which were not so well adapted for police investiga tion, and he knew besides that he was suspected (and not without reason) of correspondence with "Black Tom's" dreaded gang. He therefore judged it expedient to walk his horse quietly away, and pa3s the night at a shepherd's hut about a mile distant; and he was the rather induced to do so, because he had a message to the hutkeeper from Black Tom himself, which he had intended to deliver on his return the following morn ing. He didnot, however, depart unobserved. The black had heard his every motion, and now followed him, with noiseless step, along the narrow track. Slowly and care fully they threaded their way through the silent bush, � now plunging into the dark bed of the creek, now mounting some stony rise, � till at last the stockrider's horse stopped of its own accord at the door of a bark hut, from the chinks in whose roof shone forth a cheerful glare. Dick dismounted and entered. The blackfellow sat himself down on the grass and listened. He might have been taken for some fantastically shaped root or stump, so motionless was he. As the bushman entered the hut, the I'inmates made room for him at the fire, and S laced before him a chop and a huge amper. When he had done justice to these, he turned, and surveyed the circle with as keen a glance as his squint per mitted. Ugly faces have scowled on the world ever since the time of Cain ; but probably, from that time to this, a more repulsive visage than that of Fighting Dick never disfigured our globe. In his case, art had embellished nature, for he presented to the view at I once a broken nose and swollen eye. It ; was, however, evident that he was look- j ed upon with intense respect by all the i rest of the conclave assembled in Simon Parker's tent. " Simon," said Dick, at length, " I've heard from Black Tom." Simon's face beamed from a cloud of tobacco 6moke, like a lamp from a fog. Removing his pipe, he growled out, "Well, what does he say ?" " Say," replied Dick, " Why he says that we are to collect all hands, and wait for him in the cave at Mount Wombat, and he will take us on a new lay." " I'll tell you what," said a very small man, whose words with difficulty strug- ' gled through a dense mass of brown beard, " if Master Tom ,dbes'ht take care : what he's a doing on, he'll get foul of the i Winburn blacks, for that cave is one of their Quambies wheri they go their round, and they'll be for . turning on him

" They're on'y a pack of cowards, when all's said and done: "Why, I laid jthe stock-whip about one on ..'em six months ago, and he said he'd kill me for it, but I a'nt heer'n tell on him since "fhen." '' "He'll nab you yet, my lad," said the bearded one; "believe me, he'll nab you yet. My oath, lad, they'll have. you, and no two ways about it. There an't no gam mon about them coves." " My word ! " Assented the group, in chorus. a "Well," said Dick, carelessly, "let 'em _ come when they please. I ar'nt afraid o' no man in fair fight ; and they must be knowing chaps if they catch me ksleep." With these words he went out, unstrapped his blankets from bis saddle, ;and took the bridle from his horse's head. While so employed, a �jag' spear whizzed past his head, and buried itself in the eye of the horse, who fell heavily to the ground, with a violent shudder. He was dead. With a yell of rage, Dick rushed in tho direction whence the spear had come. The inmates of the hut, alarmed at his cry, followed with axes and lire- brands. Simon headed them, bearing a San" The bearded prophet alone remain ed by the fire; and, as he refilled his pipe, and placed a hot qinder on the top, skid, meditatively, "I told you so, my !mi yu how it would be." : ; 'The party outside were meantime scouring the bush in all directions ; their fed brands shedding a fitful light amongst 'he giant gums around them.

 ; returning to Melbourne, when an unex pected visitor made his appearance. This was the black who has already been in troduced to our readers. He shut the door behind him; and without speaking, took his scat on a block placed within the spacious chimney. Burton addressed him in the mixed jargon used in the inter course between the settlers and the blacks. " Name, you ? " " Mister Cato, me." "Well, Mr. Cato, what brought you here ?" "You come, pialla, with me, along a door, by-an'-bye I tell you bushranger yabber." Burton's only reply was going out into the open air. The black followed him; and, as before, shut the door after him. Lambert sat still by the fire. After a short time Burton returned, and said, as he took down a gun from the wall, � " Cato tells me that the bushrangers are now assembled in a cave at Mount Wombat, and Black Tom himself is to meet them there. Cato will lead us to a place where we can lie in ambush, and see all that passes in the cave. Shall we go ?" " Can we trust the black fellow ? " questioned Albert. "Yes," said Burton, "I will answer for him, for he is an old acquaintance of mine ; besides, he has an enemy amongst the robber, � no less a person than our old friend, Fighting Dick." "We shall try his mettle to-night," answered Lambert, as he went into the kitchen to prepare the troopers for a mid night expedition. At ten o'clock the moon rose in all her splendour, throwing a thousand silver spangles on the blackwood and sassafras trees. The two young men had taken a rather light supper; for, like most warri ors on tneir first expedition, they were in a state of considerable excitement. Hastily slipping on their blue shirts, and hanging large sheath knives at their belts, they proceeded to the kitchen to review their army. The men were soon in readi ness, and when assembled in the open air, really presented a formidable appearance. Those who had come with Albert Lam bert were armed with sword and pistols. They had taken the latter from their holsters, as Cato had told them the road was impassable to horses. These men were used to encounters with desperate characters, and had a sort of discipline, which rendered their assistance very valuable. The rest of the men were the miscellaneous mob of a sheep station � strong, for the most part, and skilled in the use of the guns they carried. Many of them had personal enemies among the bushrangers ; and all of them were ready to stand by Walter to the last, for he bore amongst them the character of a fair and liberal employer, and bad become a great favorite with those under him. The party now started for Mount Wombat, the black leading the way, and in two hours they were at the mouth of the cave to which he had referred. It was a spacious room, which had been partly formed by nature, and after wards enlarged and embellished by the hand ot man. It contained a party of fifteen men. Black Tom himself sat in 

 the midst � a powerful man, of handsome appearance; but his countenance was nearly concealed by enormous whiskers, whose color had procured him his name. Amongst the rest, Burton recognized Fighting Dick, and Simon the hut-keep er ; and the faces of the others were, for the most part, familiar to those who had been long on his station. Lambert entered first, and seizing Black Tom by_ the collar, presented a pistol at him, with the other hand. As he did so the rest of his party entered, and a keen contest ensued. The lights were upset in the struggle, and the fight had to be conducted in utter darkness. For some time the cave was filled with pistol shots and execrations. Lambert felt himself thrown heavily to the ground, where he lay for some time insensible. Burton struggled for some time with a powerful opponent, whom at last he brought to his knee. Shadwell, having stabbed some one, found himself unex pectedly at liberty; having positively nothing to do, he employed himself in lighting the lamps which stood around. For some time the feeble illumination struggled in vain against the thick cloud of smoke; but as the room gradually cleared, it disclosed a ghastly scene. Around lay the convulsed bodies of those who had fallen ; their face6 still wearing an expression of hate or fear. Four of the troopers had been slain, and Burton's stockman and two of the shepherds were also amongst the dead. In one corner the corpse of Simon Parker stood erect against the wall ; and near him lay the bleeding form of Lambert Of those who had survived the dreadful conflict, each held his prisoner, with the exception of Shadwell, who, walking round, bound the robbers, one by one, with handkerchiefs. Black Tom and Dick, with two others, had escaped; six yet remained in the hands of the captors ; and seven bleeding and distorted forms told the fate of the rest. Hastily constructing a litter of boughs, they placed the wounded Lam bert upon it, and conveyed him, with the prisoners to the public house at Barra- Yatta; while Burton returned to his own station. That day three weeks witnessed the execution of the prisoners at Mel bourne ; and about a fortnight more wa3 sufficient to restore Lambert to perfect health. Black Tom and his mates were not heard of till about two months after, when having organized another hand, they again became the terror of the sur rounding country. (To be concluded on Friday next.) How arc the Mighty Fallen! � The 'Daily News' says that a horse which was iu tho famous cavalry charge at Balaclava now runs in a Southampton omnibus. If it hear the sound of a gun it starts off, and there is the greatest difficulty in reining it in.
