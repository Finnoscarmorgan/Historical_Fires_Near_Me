CHAPTER XVI 

 FIRE ! FIRE ) 

 It was December, 1854. We�that is, �Jim and myeelf, for some of our party had left and gone to one or other of the new -diggings that were breaking out every -day�had been on the cveek for more than a year, ai:d, taking one thing with �-another, had done very well indeed. 

 We had had letters from home, con taining but little of interest to me, save those which came from my uncle, and which merely told me of the W3ll-being of himself, the family, and of Bella. I never wro;e to her directly, nor she to me, for there was a tacit understanding that I was not as yet an accepted lover, .and my pride forbade my doing anything �underhand to win her. liut never a ?letter came from him that did not coutain ?a blue "Forget-me-not," withered and �faded it is true, but still a 44 Forget-me not." I knew who sent it. How it got into the letter I did not know. Whether it was put in by stealth, or whether the 

 -old man happened to be looking another ! <way when the letter was sealed, I could | �not tell, but there it was. My father's i letters were as regular and as methodical �as his own book-keeping, and once I had a missive from Chariie, a kmd of duty letter, which I as dutifully answered. "That he had not sped in hi* wooing I well knew ; the bonnie blue flowers told me that, for I knew that Bella was too honest and true a girl to sive her hand to ?one, and to send love tokens to another. 

 And thus with me had the time gone -on, toiling hard at the precarious labour of gold digging ; J had gone on steadily making money, and, although neither -Jim nor myself were either mean or stingy, we did not, as too many clid, plunge recklessly into the wild whirl of mad, riotous living that characterised all the.digging townships of those days. We ;had done sometimes well, sometimes bad ly, and though we had not made any of the monster finds that set the world .ablaze with excitement, yet we had money in the bank, and were well .satis 

 fied- . 

 The diggings�which, by the way, I 

 mention, for reason* that those who 

 Have been there will understand, were not on Fiery Creek, but on one of its head tributaries�were not of any great extent; the ground was very patchy, and the sinking difficult; and many men pre ferred, after a few trials, to try the more extensive workings lower down, and on 

 the main creek itself. 

 Yet there was of course, the usual quantity of straggling stores aud grog: shanties to supply the necessities and luxuries for a couple of hundred men, for at about that number our little communi 

 ty steaaily kept. Taken for all in all, we were a peaceable loi ; for, although there were frequent quarrels and fights and drunken brawls, yet the good sense of the majority had sufficient restraint on the wilder and more reckless ones to pre vent any serious outbreaks. 

 I began this chapter by saying that it was in December, 1854:. Those who re member the end of 1854 will also remem ber that the season was an exceptionally hot one. While folks at home were shivering under the hard frost and heavy snow of Old Britain, those in this newer Britain were sweltering beneath the fierce heat of a semi-tropical summer. While they there were wrapping themselves close in their greatcoats and their then fashionable plaids, we here were doffing our garments, and almost wishing, with the humourist, that 4* we could take off our flesh, and walk about in our bones." .It was hot, hot, burning, broiling hot, from the rising of the sun till the setting of the same ; and then it was hot, hot, �hickly, humidly, oppressively hot, so hot, so densely, overpoweringly hot, as to render simple respiration a burden, a trouble, a nuisance, and a task, until long after midnight. There used to be an old story about a jackass in Liverpool that was too lazy to d�aw anything, and that when he wanted to die he sent for another jackass to help him to draw his last breath. "The bearing of this story lies in the application thereof," so far as the effect of the heat of that summer is con 

 cerned. Men felt, not with regard to their last breath, but with regard to breathing generally, as if they wanted assistance to breathe at all. Tiie only 

 time when men could feel themselves to 

 live, so to speak, was in the early morn ing, when the dew rested on the drooping leaves, and on the tents that shimmered whitely in the dim twilight, before the fierce sun came up abh-ze, like a barbaric Eastern potentate in all his glory, to chase the thin mist and the cooling mois 

 ture from the face of the e.-irth. 

 There had been no rnin for weeks and 

 weeks; the sky, unflecked even by the faintest shadow of the most fleecy cloud, was blue, blue, deeply, unalterably blue. Tnere was rarely a breath of wind, and when that did come, it was ever from the north and west�a wind that came over hundreds of lea cues of burning, sterile, sandy, and stony desert, of dried up salt lakes, and of otherwise the vast plains where the sad, silent abomination of deso lation reigns. It was ever from the north and west, and it beat upon our already parched and fevered faces like the blast of a furnace. Tiie earth was parched, and gasped thirstily for water ; the grass was sere and yellow ; and the trees and bushes hung languidly and dustily in the glowing sunshine. The creeks had dried up, or had shrunken into mere chains of waterholes or threads of runnels, and the lakes were salt-bordered swamps. Cattle drooped, and lolled out their long tongues beneath the delusive refuge of the shadeless trees; and men worked faintly amidst sweat and dust, and drank, and smoked, and grumbled the whole day long'. The cicadas which chirped their ceaseless song from mom to night, and 

 the mosquitos that p-r-r-ird round both morn and night, were the only living things that seemed to enjoy the fnn. Everything was saturated with heat�the earth until it cracked, the atmosphere until it quiv' red. The bush fires raged on the distant ranges to the north and the far away plains to the west, with dense clouds of dark smoke m the day, and a dull lurid glare in the night. It was as if "the earth should melt like wax, and the heavens be dissolved with fervent heat." 

 Day after day this lasted, day after day it became more intense, until the sparse herbage crackled underfoot, and the dried-up leaves of the gum trees darkened and hung hsilessiy from their scorched 

 boughs. i 

 One Sunday forenoon, just before j twoive o'clock, when the sun was beating I fiercely 011 the*b:tked earth�1 was lying j panting in my tent at the time, having ! given sleep up as a bad job�there was a ] sudden alarm, a cry, a rush �"�f hurrying feet, and I roused myself sufii -iently to get up and look out. I saw a sight which made my heart leap into my mouth. The rises close by wore in a blaze, and the fire, leaping from tree to tree and from bush to hush, and licking: up the brown grass beneath, was rapidly travelling 

 downwards towards the flat. Cattle and 

 horses were flying madly away in all directions, mobs of kangaroos flopping over the flats, blundering into the tents, or anywhere else in their terror, and flocks of parrots, laughing jackasses^' leatherheads, and other birds screaming overhead, or dropping into the blinding and suffocating smoke. Men were hurry ing hither and thither, bewildered, and not knowing what to do or where to turn, for the fire was on them on both sides of the creek. 

 Suddenly a voice�it was Jim Cragg's �rang out as if by inspiration, *4 Down the holes, men!" and it was passed on from mouth to mouth to the furthermost part of the flat. The efiect was electri cal; as if in an instant the flat was cleared. What was a few. very few. 

 minutes before a scene of busy life, was 

 now as barren, save for the presence of a j few empty and deserted shanties, and for j the heaps of washdi.'t, which looked like j gigantic molehills, as it had been before the foot of the white man trod it. Tents, stores, bedding, everything that would burn, tossed hurly-burly, higgledy-piggle dy down the shafts, with their owners sitting on them, waiting with beating hearte the coming of the enemy they were powerless to resist. 

 Kor had they long to wait, for, in a shorter time than it takes to tell, down came the fierce flame with a swish and a swirl amongst the brown grass, and a wild roar, like the booming of distant artillery, as it caught the dry plumage of the trees and the bare stumps and lirabs of those 

 that were dead. 

 This was a serious blow for some of the storekeepers; for, beside the fact that most of them had to leavre a great portion of their stocks in their shanties, to be consumed by the fire, a still greater por tion was smashed or irretrievably ruined by being thrown into the holes. Still, it could not be helped, and so they had to console themselves as best tiiej' might, by reflecting that it was the fortune of war, and that their profits were so large that they could alford it. One young fellow, a Jew, named Isaac Marks, familiarly known as Ikey," who had not been long on the flat, and who was only just commencing business, I was especially sorry for. He was a quiet, decent, civil chap, generally liked in the camp for his cheery and obliging manner. He was, although very close and exact in matters of business, liberal, even generous, in his way ; and many a poor fellow, both Jev and Gentile, had ample reason to bo grateful to Ikey for a free feed, or foi "tucker" for his swag, when, flat broke, he determined to try his luck elsewhere. 

 Ikey's store�a few slabs, hastily put up, and having a bark roof�lay back on the flat, some distance from the workings, and about a hundred and fifty yards from us, who were bis nearest neighbours. We tried to give him a hand when we had made all right for ourselves ; but it was only a little we could do, for sacks of flour and chests of tea were not handy tilings to carry. However, we managed to get away with some slops and blankets, leaving the heavier goods to take care of themselves. Ikey was as one demented, and it was with great trouble we forced him out of harm's way himself. I never saw a man so thoroughly broken-hearied. He sat down and cried like a child. 

 44 Oh, my beautiful goodth! Oh, I'm ruined, ruined�all gone, everything gone 

 � ob_! oh ! oh !" 

 We tried to cheer him up, telling him that he ought to be glad to have saved what he had, that it couldn't be helped, that there was fLo good to be got by grieving, and so on; but it was of no. avail, for still he sat lamenting. 

 ': Vat'll Phillipth thay to me�vat'll Cohenth thay to me, nectht month? Oh, I'm broke for ever�ruined, ruined! Oh! 

 oh!" 

 We pitied the poor fellow exceedingly, but we could hardly help laughing at his wild, irrational grief : for we knew well enough that neither Phillips, nor Cohen, nor all the children of Israel could help what was done, and that they would re stock him soon enough, and let his hills lie over for a time. We told him as much, but he would not be comforted ; and so we allowed him have his cry 

 out. 

 The flat presented a curious scene when we got out of our harbours of refuge. The earth hot, black, bare, with here and there a tusscck still smouldering. The smoke rose with a dense, acrid fume, and rolled in a thick, grey cloud overhead ; 

 aud the air was impregnated with the sharp smell of charred timber and burnt foliage, and thick with smuts that floated gently downward like black snowflakes. It was curious to see the men crawling out of the holes, like so many rabbits out of a warren, and hauling tip their treas ures as if they had been drawing water 

 from a well. 

 After all, there had not been so much damage done as might have been expect ed, for the grass had been so dry that the fire had passed by like a flash, and hardly any of the stores had really taken fire. Two of them were, however, blazing merrily, and in others the fire was smouldering. They were soon put out, though, for everybody lent a hand. We helped Ikey at his ; and when he saw how little lin<3( really been destroyed, he became as loud m his expressions of de light as he had been in his moans of despair. His dray was untouched�the paint a little blistered, that was all ; his flour bags somewhat singed; and his hams and bacon got a little preliminary touch of frying, which sent a rather un Hebrew-like aroma into our nostrils. Otherwise, the damage was very slight; aud when he got his things out of the iiole into which we had. thrown them, the place looked, almost the same as be 

 fore. 

 He was profuse in his expressions of gratitude, and his promises to o<j a good turn for us if ever he could (protuis-s which I afterwards fouud were really meant, and not the idle wind such pro mises generally turn out), and insisted on our having some champagne, a few bottles of which he kept on tLe sly. 

 It did not take long to put things to rights on the flat. The remnants of the fire were beaten and trodden out; and amidst the laughter and ringing merri ment of the men, who, now the danger was ever, began. to view the affair in the light of a huge practical joke, die white tents were'-.soon gleaujwig again in the sunlight. What was the eauas of this sudden lire? As the Snaniaids Fav. 

 - ymen saber' i'erhaps a lighted match thrown down amongst the dry grass by some careless swagiiian on the other side of the rises; perhaps a camp fire left burning at the foot of a hollow tree, which, catching, would blaze like a fur nace up the flue-like interior ; perhaps a bit of broken bottle acting as a burning glass. All these things have been, ere now, causes of conflagrations more ter rible and destructive than this.
