 ; Tiib sunset in. lurid redness, and the fading Warns loom�d{through tho. smoke,of countless tnilcfl of-taging bush fires, which for weeks had devastated theaurroundingcountry, closing with toCtt ;tto.'carcer- of. hundreds, of industrious; wdtlera,1 whoso hard-earned gains had vanished , vfore its fell breath. Orchard, garden, and 

 nasturo- had alike participated in the universal ruin. Sheep, -horses; cattle, and the fauna of the Australian forest,, were either consumed by tho conquering jflamOj or had perished of thirst in tho parched or burnt up meadow lands. Tho birds, half-suffocated by tho dense smoko which enshrouded . the neighbourhood, had cither porished with tho rest, or had taken flight to. other parts. No f sound was heard savo tho roaring of the vaBt fur - j,aco, as it rushed onwards and onwards 

 tn its; torrific: work of - destruction, with Ihecxcoption of, now and then, a disinal.wail, wrenched from the heart of,Borne ruined agri culturist,-, aa hobeheldtho labour of; years lioked up by the thousand flaming tongues around him. As; the short-lived twilight.of. ltopical;AttBtralia vanished before the invading toignt; the glare and: horror became intensified, wid tirgtd to' rapid flight the lingering land owners, -who,-.loath .to leave their hardly 

 acquired treasures, had, at almost their life's tiak, loitered listlessly about, hoping-against; hope that that God.by whose permission they had fought and won, wpuld yet pat forth His toowerful hand to arrest the dread visitant, and turn back the fiery, wrath. But it was not to bo: these peaceful, careful, laborious soil-tillers worn to learn the bitter lesson that :what; He 

 gives: Hoican rtake away, . that patient, plod ding ;industry,'..though it may bless for a time, is still subject to mutation, even as the careless unthrifty efforts of the indifferent half-worker, 

 and that what seems prosperity .is oftentimes , the progenitor of a deeper curse. Such,.what ever may be tho private . views of m\\* readers on tho subject, were at anyrate the deep con victions1 of thedespairing denizens ;of. this doomed locality, and fyit.too plainly was it pic tured onthoir begrimed and hollow-eyed faces. Not for them the pleasing notion of rewarded industry; not for them the blessedBcnsation of ? a respite from worldly trial, brought about by untiring and uncomplaining oxertion. , The guerdon of merited peace , and security was gone, and the old life of trial and labour, if life indeed be preserved to them, was to be repeated, with the additional disadvantage of knowing that their re-exertions might bear no fruit, and that th'oir prime vigour had been exhausted in their first endeavour to achieve, sucpess. 

 * Farms and homesteads had passed away in 

 smoke and flame,'.and the sullen doom-laden proprietors, with their wives and children, were wending- their way through the charred embers tif their destroyed belongings, towards the huts Und cottages of the settlers in moro favoured districts, where they hoped to receive, at, once, both sympathy and shelter. One house, a /miilding whose form and size ranked it. as the abode of refinement and ease, had as yet J escaped the attack of the all-devnuring enemy, 

 through.tho care and well-directed energy of the proprietor, who had taken the precaution to tomove from its vicinity the dead, wood and tangled undergrowth,' which arc so frequently seen in the narrow area Which surrounds,.the hut* of smaller settlers. "All' minor buildings and offices had been removed in order that.the main building might ,be completely isolated. Tho stables,' a range-of considerable length, although of inexpensive materials and construc tion, which adjoined a store, which, in its turn, 

 was connectbd with a small verandah room be

 ..'"Who was left in the house ?" he demanded of the terrified, horror-strickon group, whose sendeshad been.aroused by the.: horrible and unexpected yells; ""Who was left in the hous'o ?. Speak, some of, you I" ... 

 One man alone replied: f* To our knowledge no one was leffc behind; we went into.every room but Mr. Alford's, arid his you had, or said you had, examined yourself. At any raid he is not here,;and if there wo .cannot assist 

 him." 

 "Nonsense man; come some of you, let us make one effort , for his rescue," and running towards tho house, tho wretched proprietor made apparent endeavours to find an opening through the flameB. - Meanwhile the man who had spoken hurried to his side just in time to see a flaming figure rush from the house and Sink upon tho ground in. writhing agony. 

 The two men hurried towards him, but only to hear his last groan. ,
