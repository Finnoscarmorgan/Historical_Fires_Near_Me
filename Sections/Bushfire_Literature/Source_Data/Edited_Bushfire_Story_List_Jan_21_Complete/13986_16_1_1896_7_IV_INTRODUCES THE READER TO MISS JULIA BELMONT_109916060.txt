 CHAPTER IV.� (Continued.) 

 Bella, however, firmly believed in the bushranger, the 'ciive, and the hidden plun der, and was moreover persuaded that the faint pad she had discovered would eventu ally lead her to success. On this day she 

 was following: it wSHi tie patience and de termination of a tolack tracker. She had, indeed, got on further than at any other time; walking ahead with her pony's bridle over her arm, Winnie following until they were at last brouglit up by a flat expanse of rock. Following the direction of the trail she advanced resolutely, Winnie, who had also dismounted, close behind, while the hoofistrokes1 of the ponies rang out metalic elly. Bella stopped in the middle and look ed around. 'I am quite, quite sure,' said, the confident ycung leader, 'that I am right. Look, Winn, what a splendid view you have all over the country.' True there was a com plete panorama spread before them. They stood on the cap of a projecting knob of one of the main spurs, and, as Bella said, it was a perfect look-out from which any body of horsemen coining across the lower coun try could have been seen approaching from nearly three .cardinal points of the com pass. '?-?-'-????? -'??????- The girls stood and enjoyed the wide view, picking out particular places they knew, when suddenly Winnie's sharp ears caugb+ sounds like advancing footsteps. - 'Oh, Bell, there's smoeone coming � per haps it's the bushranger!' 'I hope he's nice if it is,' answered the undaunted Bella. 'I'm just dying to meet a bushranger; I've read such a lot about them in English novels.' The girls listened. Heavy, clumsy foot steps were undoubtedly coming down � the slope that abutted on the flat rock behind them. Bell glanced round them, then led the way to a good-sized boulder. ''Boot and saddle,' she said, and stepped on to the stone, and seated herself on her sturdy little steed. Winn was soon mount ed, too, and, confident in their game little aninmals and their own horsewomanship, they waited for the advance of the enemy, man. It was not a formidable figure who final ly approached iihem. A shambling old fel low, roughly dressed in the usual bush rag out Truth to tell, he looked somewhat dis appointed wneniheoaine in full view of them. He came on, however, and made a clumsy salute. 'Good dayj young ladies. I thought I heard voices, and being short of tobacco, I thought as there was somebody here as might have some.' 'Do you -live here. 13ien?' asked Bell, gaz ing curiously at this Rip Van Winkle of the range. 'I'm staying up here now on a kind of holiday, having a spell like. Therete a good spring back here, and I've pitched, my tent there for a bit. May I ask if you young ladies belong about here?' 'Belonged here aU my life,' laughed. BelL 'An! Then your name might be ? ?' 'Rossiter.' 'Surely now. You must be little Bell; she was the freckled one.' The two girls laughed merrily. Bell was not touchy on the subject of her sun-kisses, nor had she need to be. 'Matty's the year's work I did for your father in -dhe old time. Surely you must remembea: T-am the Hatter?'* '0* course, I've often heard of you, but don't rememb^ ' y&u ' ijersomally. What brings you up here, Dan?' 'Jost -wnat I said� a spelL When, fences came in. I gave the monMes best, amd went up tncrtih to 45he anew diggings. I made a ibit of a rise ap there, and thought I'd like to ihave a look at the old place, but tiiere� I couldn't stand 'the township, so I came up Ihere, -wittere it's quiet and homelike. Al ways ia hatter, you see, Miss Bell' 'Well, Dan,' said Bell, who, on the strength of former acquaintanceship, al though forgotten by her, had at once estab lished herself on terms of intimacy with the old fellow, 'is your camp far from here? We should like to. see it' 'Surely, Miss Bell. But who is the other young laidy? She's not a Bossiter?' ''This is my ?friend, Miss G-radng-er.' 'Of Rotta-rotta, Must have seen you when you were a baby, I expect; but you've grown since then. Sorry ito hear your farther lost the old place.' Winnie bent down, and shook jhands 'with the old -hatter, them he led the way across the rock in a different direction to itihe way he had come. 

 CHAPTER V. The old fellow's canip was on the head of the next gully; ithere'was the tiny spring he had. mentioned, wihiyjfc *jhe !had cleared out An old sheep dog was chained to the tent pole, and he rose up and barked indignantly at them � evidently, he, too, was a hatter. Bell slid down from her horse, and went up fearlessly and patted his head, and !he fawn ed upon her in return. Everything about the place was neat, and methodically tidy. Dam invited :ibjs guests.. to have some tea, and, on? their assenting, made lthe fire up and put the billy on to boiL 'Dan,' said Bella, 'do you remember the story aibout the bushranger who used to live up here?' 'I remember a yam of some sort about 'And about his cave?' 'Aye! and Ms oave, where the folks said toe had pianited a lot of watahes and things.' 'Yes, yes,' cried Ben, eagerly. 'Winnie and I have been looking days and days for tfhat cave. I've found an old track that I believe leads to it Now,- Fll tell you- what we'll do. I'll show you -the track; and while you're up here you can puzzle it out, and ?wiheai-you find it� which, of course, you ?will � well go halves in the plunder.' Dan laughed. 'Of course, I mil help, Miss BeH. On one condition.' 'W&at's that?' 'Tbait you let me have first pick out of the watches. Specially if (here's any ladies' watches among- 'em. There's a young wo man. I know as I should Hike to make a pre sent to.' 'Certainlny yon shall, Dam; although I'm quite shocked,'' at ~&n cid shatter like you knowing a. young woman.' The girls had a aneny tea, drinking ft out of the cteanly-polisbed pamniMns which Dan prodtioed. .~ 'SSiem. ?Hiey ; jfirepared to return.

 Followed by Dam, the two girls retraced their steps to the qtfrer side of tihe flat rock, then, -with a very*' uncomrenMonal naad soake they parted, and the two rode home talking gaily over -ttieir adventure. Next morning, Bella and Wjnnie, followed by Rossiter leading a pack-horse� as he called it, 'doing blackiboy'� climbed the range and arrived at the hatter's camp. There was a cordial greeting between him and his father's old servant, whom, of course, he had been old enough to remem ber well The stares were unpacked, and stored away, then Dan beckoned Bell mys teriously on one side. 'I poked about after you'd gone,' he said, 'arid again this morning. And I found the continuation of that track. T'aint a walla by pad, either. WfiH you come and see it?' Bell eagerly assented, and waving a gay adieu to Winnifred she followed in Dan's wake. Rossiter had been stooping over the old dog; raising his head he noticed Winnie etapding a little distance off. In her riding habit she looked older than she really was, and as he looked at her standing there enjoy ing the fresh air and some happy-day dream, it suddenly struck Bossiter that his old playmate had all at once shot up into a woman, and a very pretty woman at that Presently the two cave-hunters came back and a hearty meal followed, Dan proudly doing the honors. Then with tine packhorse, with the now empty saddle, trotting on ahead of them they descended the track, leaving Dan to follow tip the task a bonnie young girl with a slightly freckled face had set him to do. He washed up t(he pannikins and plates and tidied up the camp, peopling it once more with the memory of the bright friendly . faces that had lately been there, one in particular; Bell had evidently made a conquest His domestic duty finished, he took his old double-barrel, stuck his tomahawk in his belt and after patting the old dog went off again to the track. Slowly and patiently he' followed it for nearly a mile, then he came to an insurmountable block. The faint worn-out clue stopped at the foot of a precipitous cliff which formed the cap of the range. Dan looked to right and left, but could see no means of ascent He went back a short distance and looked upward. The cliff was about fifty feet in height, and about half-way up it was broken by a pro jecting ledge. The wall at the back of this ledge he could not see for the projection of the ledge itself, and if he stepped back still further the foliage of the trees shut out his view. A conviction began to grow on him. that there was a cave, and that the entrance was on that seemingly inaccessible ledge. The ledge on either hand merged, after a time, into the smooth face of the cliff. If there was a cave there the means of access was either from the top or the bottom, and one way looked as impossible as the other. He was active for his age, and selecting the tallest tree opposite to where he sup posed the entrance to exist he took his tomahawk, and cutting a few steps, black fellow fashion, in. the trunk was soon up amongst the branches. The foliage, how ever, still obstructed his view, and it was not until he had chopped down one or two boughs that he had a clear opening. He was now not far off the level of the ledge he had been looking at, and able to see almost to the base of the cliff that rose from it and there was a cleft, a fissure or aperture of some kind. But how had the mythical marauder reached his eyrie? By a rope either from the top to the cave, or from the cave to the ground? Hardly. In either case the rope would have to be left suspended there, and it would be rank folly to have a trail leading to a cliff on which hung a rope pointing' out the whereabouts of the cavern. Dan, perched in the highest fork of the tree, pondered over all the possi bilities of the case; he was a shrewd old buehman, and not easily thrown off a scent He descended and followed the trail to where it died out within a short distance. of the cliff, then he looked back at the tree he had ascended, and it struck him that the entrance he hail eeen was a considerable distance to the right of where he then stood. Dtermined to solve the riddle, he made a plain mark on the rock immediately oppo site the termination of the track, and then re-ascended the tree. The cave was nearly fifty or sixty feet to the right of the mark. This was conclusive. The ascent and de scent had certainly not been made by means of a rope, otherwise the pad would have stopped immediately beneath the cave. He went back once more and looked around. Close to his feet he at last noticed the stump of an old tree burnt to the ground. He traced it up in ^imagination. If~it leaned towards the cliff at all in the former days of its life, it would have afforded a means of access to the ledge, thence along the ledge to the cave. But this would nave been as palpable a hint as a dangling rope. Dan examined the stump on.ee.-r more. It was a ring only; the ring of the shell of an old, old tree. He had got it he firmly be lieved. The tree had been a shell when the outcast had used it as a stairway. It had been broken off short by wind or lightning, and the top did not reach nearly to the height of the ledge; the distance between the top of the riven trunk and the ledge could be bridged by a short ladder. When the occupant descended he would drop the ladder into the hollow .shell during his ab sence; when he re-ascended he. would carry it with :�him- -to the' cave. Why it was as easy as shelling peas. If Anybody climbed the shell it was too dose to the ledge for him to see 4he cave, and- not dose enough to get on to the ledge without assistance. Dan went home to his camp well satisfied. 'The little missy,' he reflected, 'would never have found it out by herself. She'd never have thought of the tree, and if she had she couldn't have climbed it' Dan's next move was obviously to go in and get a rope and lower himself from the top on to the ledge. He had no intention of antici pating Bell in her examination of the mys terious cave, but be must see that it was all safe for 'her to go there first; but he did not carry out this plan for a day or rtwo, he had some preparations to make first CHAPTER TL No break, in the iron drought, no sign of bountiful, rain-giving clouds mustering' up to shed their team over the parched land. Bush fires were ravaging' the country wiiere on any grass was left, and horses -were kept saddled at the principal stations ready for men to mount and ride and protect a threat ened paddock or line. of fencing. Still the Oasis kept a little verdure about it, and old Chevalier was beginning to pick up in flesh and put on frisky airs of eolthood which should have been long since forgotten. In spite of the surrounding desolation, of per ishing stock, fast sinking dams and fomfr^ and a general shadow of impending bamk '-ruptcy, *t 'WSfi a- Sialcyon. time for Winnie. Her -father was nome for a long spell, and the .vitality of youth and its enjoyment of the present was strong within her. Bell was plunged fin myetery; that 'was the only drawback. . Instead of confiding to Winu all Her hopes and a^iiadaims regarding iSie great discovery of the outlaw's cave, Dan Hhe ?Hatfcer was now jQer^coBfidant, and he made several' journeys to the station, and took away various tools used in bush carpentering jobs.

This led to a sharp passaged, arms between the two, BlacfcjLock accusing Eos eiter of eelectfing over iito liead, to which forjasriter to fifcmng famgmtgA inftvsnprl Mm that luerwas actually, engaged in pacing toe 

 boundaries when Blacklock came up.. There was still fortiher confusion in the Blaeklock camp w'hen Reggie 'stood up for rthe villain 'Bossiter. The land, he said, was open to anybody who applied first for it To wihibh the old man, who, with his acquisition of station property, had adopted 'raibid conser vatism, roared in reply, 'Wnat does he mean by going against his rown order, and standing by that old pauper Grainger?' To this his undutiful son, returned that Grainger was of Rossiter's order, and that the Blacklock family were only raw' re cruits. The old man nearly disinherited him on the spot, but the storm passed for a time. The drought threatened to ruin Blacklock, directly and indirectly. It was too late to save his stock by travelling, and he had nowhere to send them to, ; even if they could have staggered off the run. In^ directly, the trade of the whole colony was affected, and other investments, in which he was largely interested, were tottering to their falL Moreover, bills incurred by his two sons, particularly the elder one, began to come by every mail with alarming fre quency from Sydney and Melbourne. No wonder his wraith was aroused at Reggie's defection to the enemy. Lee had proved but a leaky vessel. Black lock bad got hold of him, and found out eM. about the supposed silver lode. In his own, came and those of Ms sons he took up minerai leases on the presumed run of the lodes, outside of the boundary of the selec tion he had vainly made an attempt to se cure. Others followed aim, for mining is the national Australian craze; parties were started out prospecting, and the quietness of the gully above the head of tihe Oasis was broken with the noise of pick and shovel, and disfigiii-ed with unsightly mounds' of earth! Rossiter held his hand. The samples -(he had sent down had not resulted as well as was expected, and the assay only showed a return that would barely cover working ex penses. Silver, too, was steadily falling. 'Let them do the prospecting, and� pay the expense of it' he said to Grainger, with a chuckle. 'Whichever way it turns up, we must profit by it If the true lode is struck worth working, we Shave it -on our ground; if it all turns out a duffer, why, the selection is worth the money spent' Grainger assented pleasantly. Work and worry were beginning to tell upon Mm, and he was glad of the quiet rest and the sup port of nis enemrgetic young friend. Al though by no mean's a man who wore his heart upon his sleeve, Rossiter had long ago offered to assist him; but Grainger had planned has own life, and while he did not mind the coarsest of fare and roughest of company, Ms fastidious nature shrank from tie burden of an unpayable monetary debt of gratitude, even as delicately offered as Rossiter managed to convey it. Meanwhile the dry weather continued, and old Dan had nearly completed Ms prepara tions for the grand exploration of the cave. By the aid of a rope, he had lowered him self from the top of the cliff, easily accessi ble by another route, on to the ledge, and thence to the entrance of the cave. As a man of many and varied experiences, ne knew a little about most outside things, and the exploration of underground passages amongst others. At the entrance he lit two candles, and, holding one in each hand, ad vanced a step or two into the narrow en trance. (To be continued-)
