 CHAPTER XV. � Continued. 

 Julian Lessing was then sworn. He gave Davenport, Devonshire, England, as his ad dress, stating that ho was a tourist in Aus tralia. Then in his customary cold and im- passive manner- 1i +1; 

 ->� uvovimcu i/iiu occur- roncos of the day of the' murder. Again he told how Hope had at first declared that the whip fopnd beside the . murdered man was nothis,' aml-how hchad said tliat bummers had .died from heat apoplexy, and that the,' soon er .lie was buried the better. lLastly, . he related Iiow;he.;(Lessing) had' as-' sis Led Afiss 'Sumiiiersto I)i'e|)are lier neji' hew's body for burial, ,an<l bliow she had pointed out to him :tlie. Wound on. the hcad.' With the- same rdcep' artfulness as lie liad shown at tlicpolice court, he was too scru pulous to state on oath;-\\vhicli temple was bruised; he could not be. certain,. but thought that the injury was on the right side. . . V ; That completed ; the Crown prosecutor's examination, lind I. was at- liberty to ask him any question; I said, "You state that you sire an English tour ist.' Have you ever been 'in Australia before your present visit?". : : "Never." - , :: "You wore, not living.liii .Victoria, twelve years ago?" . \\ " ' : "No," lie answered; and the hard, bold eyes looked steadfastly at .me. "Thank you; that will do," I said.- Then, as he turned to leave the box, Tasked, in an off band manner, "By tlie way, did you get a telegram from Godfrey yesterday?" For one instant a look of lurid malignity discomposed the mask in wliieli liis features wore habitually, set. : . Then gaining com mand over himself ragaih, he answered, "Yes." -i JvL.r -v - The Crown prosecutor now stood- up, and said that the ease for. the Crown was closed. The judge asked were There any witnesses for the defence. "Yes, "'I answered. ."Call Fenwick San- down." . While I was waiting for the detective I looked round the courthouse. It wns an oblong room. At one ; end was the raised platform, -surmounted by the royal arms of England, beneath which device wns placed the judge's chair. , In front, and to the right of the ' bench, was .tlie witness box, and then the forms, in tliree rows, .on which sat the jury. Immediately .below the judge's bench was the little railed' in desk belonging to the clerk and in front of that again wiis.the-table reseiwed for the lawyers. To the left of the lower iind of the table was the dock, in which was ICeitli Hope, guard ed by a trooper. Then eame a "harrier which ran across the chamber, in front of which the witnesses who had given evi dence were accommodated with seats, and beyond' which the public had taken every inch of space, so densely was the court thronged. - ; Tlie .detective .how tobk his place, on the witness- stand, and , in answer, to my ques tions' deposed, as follows: � ."My name is Fcnwick Sandown. I am a detective, in the service of the Victorian Government. I hold a warrant for the apprehension of James Cassidy, at one time a clerk in the Mel bourne Lands Office, on a charge of embez zling moneys, the property of the Govern ment of Victoria. I saw Jaincs Cassidy yes terday and to-day, and recognised him at once. I have reason to believe that he is at present in this court, passing under the name of Julian Lessing." Herclstoppedintlieexamination andasked the judge to read the warrant nnd look at the photograph which Sandown had of Cas sidy. These were handed up to his Honor. I then said I wished the photograph to be shown to the jury. After some arguing between tlie Crown prosecutor and myself, this also was done. Resuming my examina tion of Sandown, I said � "Look round the court, and see if there be any ' one present whom you recoguise as James Cassidy." The detective had evidently used the time taken up by my little argument with the Crown prosecutor, for he immediately an swered, "The man in the light suit, sitting to the right of Dr. Jones, is James Cas sidy." Then I said I would pause for a minute, till the jury could compare Lessing, or Cas sidy, with the photograph they had. It passed from hand to hand, and, as each of them scrutinised it and Lessing by turn, I rejoiced to see come on each face that brightening of intelligence which nearly always lightens the human features when some uncertainty is solved. Lastly, I said, and this question was for Lessing's benefit; "Have you ever seen a document showing tliat Mr. Summers pos sesses land in Melbourne?" "Yes, you showed me the paper four days ago." I then sat down. The Crown prosecutor rose, and endeavored to shake the evidence which took away the character of his most important witness. All his efforts, how ever, were of no avail. He only brought out that Sandown . remembered Cassidy when All Victorian rights In this story hava be.-n purchased by the proprietors oi " 'J'bo Leader. 

 he was a clerk in the Lands Office, and that the detective was certain that when the embezzler was conveyed to Melbourne 50 people could identify him. I glanced at Keith. There was a look of hope, in his eyes which I had not seen there since the day of the police court. Then I looked anxiously at Lessing. Would all my endeavors only succeed in prolonging the agony a little? Although the man knew that the wealth he had almost seized had been snatched from him, and that he was doomed to years of con finement, his face betrayed no sign of emotion. His stoicism and self- command almost forced me to reluctant ad miration. And yet my whole chance of sav ing my cousin rested on my being able to break down this very self-command and stoicism. Is it to bo wondered at that I al most despaired, as I drank a tumbler of water to moisten my throat, and arranged my notes, before I rose to address the court; �_"Gentlemen of tlie jury," I commenced, ' . let nie recapitulate: the evidence given in . cross-examination by tlie Crofrn witnesses. To. begin with, Dr. Liston admitted that the death of-.'ChaHSs vSunimors, after he re- ee-jiis:ihj�ryy.wi�ig�it deal.more'sud- .den..tlian;:lie:;woiiJd;liavo:e'xpectcc3;Next, iVj'.ah; WRliamvRichardsfivas before yoti, I demonstratbd tliat it- was' quite' possible for Dcssiiig to have had a whip concealed in Jiis clothes- witliout Ricliards noticing it. The -same witness told you how the whip handle was found close to the fire, and how from the place where it' lay, two tracks ran to the dead body of Charles Summers, beneath the tree. Fortunately for the cause of jus'- ltice, . lie also noticed that the murdered man's shirt had been pulled up about the body.- Lastly, he deposed that, there was at .least half an hour during which he did not see Lessing. "Now, remember tliat the case for the Crown rests altogether on circumstantial evidence. No human' eye, save that of the murderer, saw the deed committed. The Crown, has advanced the' theory of Charles Summers's death-' being caused by Keith Hope striking him on the head with a whip. Yet how can you reconcile with this hy pothesis Summers dying in such a short time: or what motive could Hope have had for dragging the body 10 or 12 yards from the place where the Blow was 'delivercd, as .indicated by the position of the dead man's bat; _ and last, and - strangest of all, why should the shirt have been' so disar ranged? .. "Twill now give you' what I believe is the .true .-account of the murder� an account which you will find explains all these mys teries, which The theory of the Crown leaves unsolved. " "When Keith Hope was at Currumbede, 'the.; afternoon before Charles Summers's death, lie forgot his whip when leaving. Some hours afterwards Lessing saw it hang ing on the garden palings, and some time that night possessed himself of it. On the same evening he stole this lint pin, which I show you, from a lint which one of the Oumunliede ladies had left for a few min utes in the sitting room. "The next day, when Lessing accompanied Summers and Richards to tlie bush fire, he had both these articles with him. After Charles Summers left them Lessing re mained a short lime with Richards, and when a favorable opportunity came to leave him without being noticed lie did so. He hurried along the margin of tlie burning ground till lie saw Summers working in the midst of tlie smoke. Then drawing out the whip, from which he had removed the thong, he crept up behind the unsuspecting youth, and dealt him a blow on the head to stun him. AYlien he did so Summers's hat dropped off, and he himself was falling for ward into the fire, when Lessing, dropping tlie whip, grasped him below the armpits, and dragged liini beneath the bibbel. "As soon as he had the body there, away from tig: intolerable heat of the fire, lie pro ceeded to carry out his design. Let me pause to remark that it was no part of Les sing's plan to fracture Summers' skullj all lie wished to do was to stun him. . He liad devised to accomplish his ends in a very subtle manner. "He now drew up the shirt, exposing the chest. Summers was lying on his back, breathing heavily. A minute later, and his breathing had stopped for ever. Lessing had driven this long needle into his eliest, entering at tlie left nipple so that it wou'd transfix the valves of the heart. Drawing it out, he laid it on the ground, where I found it more than a month afterwards; and ho proceeded to re-arrange the murdered man's shirt. Before this was completed, he glanced up, and saw a horseman approach ing. Without pausing to search for the hat Sin, or do anything further to the body, he ived into the smoke, and hurried back to where lie had left Richards. As soon as he judged he had got near enougli to him, lie stopped and commenced beating out the fire. -Thus it came that when Keith Hope arrived at the body and called for help, Lessing and Richards were working toge ther about a quarter of a mile away. Tin's, I am morally certain, is how tlie murder was committed. I will now explain to you the motive for the crime." I stopped for a moment to take a sip of water. I looked at Lessing, but could not detect the slightest change in his face. His eyes met mine, and he said, in his usual voice, "Better telegraph to Summers not to take any more of his medicine." Ilis watch was in his right hand, and as he spoke he pressed the spring; the back flew open, and lie took a small white wafer from it and put it into his mouth. In less than a minute his head dropped on Dr. Jones's shoulder, and lie was dead. "One of the new vegetable alkaloids evi dently," was Dr. Linton's curt comment, as ho dropped the limp arm, after feeling the pulseless wrist for a moment. And now for a few minutes all was coufu- sion. The people at the back of the court were standing on benches and leaning on tlio shoulders of those ill front, in order tliat they might view this fresh tragedy. Nor was it till the judge threatened to clear the court that order was restored. Meanwhile Keith had signed that he wanted to speak to me. On going to him he said, " For heaven's sake lose no time in warning Mr. Summers. Lessing has apparently been ad ministering a slow poison to liira. ' 1 was about to hurry away, when I noticed that tlie jury were very busy whis pering; their twelve heads were all in a duster. Presently the heads separated into the three rows of four each again, and when quiet was. restored the foreman said, t lour Honor, the jury have agreed on their ver dict; w'e find' ill. Hone not guilty. I at oucc told Keith that I would go and send Mr. Summers the telegram; and, giving him 

 Mr.' Cotswold's address, asked him to follow me there. CHAPTER XVI. The evening of tlie second day after the trial found a party of seven assembled in the Currumbede sittingroom. Sandoivn liad come with me to treat with Mr. Summers for tlie purchase of his Melbourne property, and Keith had brought Dr. Liston, being naturally anxious respecting the health of a patient whose medicine Lessing had known so much about. Ella was sitting between her father and Keith, and Miss Jane was also present. When we four from Pottinger liad ar rived early that morning, Dr. Liston had immediately gone to Mr. Summers's room and examined hiin. He told me soon after wards that he could not be certain what poison had been administered, but what ever it was it was a slow one, and enough of it had not been taken to produce anv very serious effects. Mr. Summers, al though still suffering a little from rheuma tism, rose in time tor breakfast, and ap peared to be much tlie same as when I last saw him. Ella was in the garden watching for us, and Keith at once went to her. I never ex pect to see two happier people than they looked half an hour later, when, hand 111 hand, they came up to the path. I was oil The verandah alone at , the time, and I noticed that Keith whispered, something to :hfe'r, lit which she blushed: very, prettily.; < ; "Dear-cousui .Anthony;" she said, "how lean I .eVcr thank you for'.the happiness you have ' giveii iiie?"/ She 'gave , me Tier 'soft little hand, and. held up lier. sweet face for me'to' kiss her." I stooped down and touched her pure ivhite brow' with my lips. "Heaven ideas you, Ella," I answered, "you have done a hundred times more for nie than I have been able to db'for you. You have restored to 'me the faith and some of the dreams of my youth." "Ella and' I have arranged everything," Keith said. "As soon as Mr. Summers is out of danger we will get married, and go home to England for a six months' holiday. While we are away I want you to live at my place--the men I have are good, and know their work, and all you will have to do will be to sign cheques. "Yes, cousin Anthony," Ella interposed, "and you must promise me now tliat when we return you will live with us always." And then we all went in to breakfast. When the meal was over Ella and Keith disappeared, and I did not see them again till lunch time. I had a long talk with Mr. Summers, during which he told me of the will Lessing Jiad induced him to make. The floor gentleman also recalled the drive he ad had with Lessing before his son's death, and how the conversation had turned on the subject of the risk of death from heat apoplexy when working at a bush fire. He made a promise concerning Sandown, w.liieli I was commissioned to tell him on a suitable occasion. Miss Jane I saw some time later in the diningroom. " I have to congratulate you, Miss Sum mers," I remarked, "on coming into a for tune. The land in Melbourne is worth be tween �30,000 and �40,000, and as your father made no will your share will be very considerable." ' To my surprise the woman looked miser able. , , " Don't speak to me of this wretched money, Mr. Rusden. I wish I had burned that fatal paper when I destroyed father's letters.. But for it Charlie would huve been alive to-day. In my own way I loved mv nephew and my brother. My nepliew is'dcnd, and though my brother seems to be alive, his heart is dead and in his son's grave. Even you� forgive me for putting the case so strongly� a man, who seems to have made a failure of his whole life, are loved for vour own sake by your cousin and Ella, and -that apart altogether from the service you have rendered them. In this volt have succeeded where I have failed, for in all the world not one one single human being has an atom of love to spare to the lonely woman called Jane Summers." With the dignity which great unhappi- ness always lends, the lady rose and left me. I felt sorry for her. Y'ct I knew the inexor able law of nature� tliat those who let tlie spring and summer pass without planting a seed will, when autumn comes, have never a flower. And now, as I said in the beginning of this chapter, we were all assembled after dinner in the sittingroom. All were anxi ous to hear from me the explanation of the mystery which had surrounded the murder. '"To "begin at the beginning," I said, "I think Mr. Sandown is right in his surmise that Lessing knew of Mr. Summers's Mel bourne property when he came to Currum bede. I believe that lie came here for the purpose of getting the title deed into his pos session. In this, ns we know, he suc ceeded. He liad next to decide how he was going to turn it into money. Remember that he could not go to Melbourne, for fear of being arrested on a charge of em bezzlement. In tills dilemma he hit pn a plan which meant the sacrifice of two lives, and very nearly sacrificed three. "First lie gets Mr. Summers to make his will, appointing him and Charles executors. Then the bush fire gave him the opportu nity to execute the plan he had matured. As' I said at the trial, I believe it was no part of his design to fracture Charles's skull. I think he meant to stun him, kill him with the needle, and then drag the body back again to the cdge.of the fire, where it would get scorched and the clothes be burned. In this way everv trace of the crime would be destroyed, and it would appear that Charles had succumbed to the heat and fallen where he stood. The unexpected appearance of Keith prevented hiin from carrying out his plan to completion. He had just time to escape, and no more. It is worth while noticing that, although he pointed out to Billy the suspicious circumstances that Keith's whip was found on the ground, and that Keith seemed to wish the body to be buried quickly, yet, for at least a month, he mentioned these things to no one else. He knew that had an inquest ben held at once, the injury to the heart would pro bably have been discovered. "Whether Lessing ever wished to marry Ella or not, I cannot decide. Had he mar ried her, and then informed Mr. Summers of the land in Melbourne, he could have counted on getting a considerable fortune. Again, however, Keith unconsciously foiled his plans; the lucky fellow had at last won the prize he had been trying to gain for years. Lessing's first object now was to get Keith out of the way. 1 am convinced in own mind that it was he who furnished the information which led to my cousin's arrest "Had Keith been convicted, and had Mr. Summers here continued taking his medi cine some time longer, Lessing would have been master of. the situation. As Ella's agent, acting in her name and through a firm of lawyers, lie would have sold the Melbourne property .without her ever know ing that it Delbngcd to her; and as soon as 

 lie got the money he would probably havfe left Australia. There are many places in Europe where a gentleman with thirty thou sand pounds could pass his life very agree ably." I stopped speaking, and we all sat in sil ence, thinking. When I had referred to the danger that Mr. Summers had been in, Ella had nestled up to her father, and was now sitting holding his hands. "What was that mother of pearl thing we found in the wicked man's box?" she asked. "Tliat, Ella, was the key to the cipher. You remember by that time I had found the hat pin below the bibbel, and Miss Almyr had told me of seeing Lessing handling your hat; in fact, he was stealing the hat pin." Every detail of the crime was then in my possession, written, however, so to speak, in a cipher which I could not read. Up till then, I had be lieved that Lessing was, as he pretended, an English tourist. To our finding that little piece of mother-of-pearl Mr. Sum mers and Keith owe their lives. It is a South Sea Island fishhook. - ; ' "Yeare ago, when I was in the islands, I learned how" the natives have a subtle me thod of committing murder by driving a long mat needle into the heart of the vic tim. As soon as I saw the' fishhook � which _ .is not the sort of thing "a mtin would' bring from England;� I - guessed that Lessing had been- iit. some, time in the South Seas, and had there learned the secret." .. i "Yes,",; SandowiT interposed;: ''you remem-' . her >1, told, yoirithat there was, a rumor that ' CaSsidyv or Lessiiig "as- you' call ; him;' had been there." :. " ' " ' ,'?I remember, Mr. Sandown," I said, "and very pleased 1 was : to have my conjecture verified. .It is a painful subject to all of us, .and I do not wish to dwell on it. I will only say that the theory that Lessing mur dered poor Charles in this way fits all the . facts of the case as no other explanation does." : ".Yes," Keith said, "and the man whose brain, uuravelled this mystery, which not one in a thousand could have solved, waa unwilling to undertake my defence, on the ground that he was a brokeu down old law- . yer. There is never to be any more of that sort of talk, -Anthony, remember;" "You are mistaken, Keith," I answered. "I ,ani among my friends, and I will say what I believe to be the truth. Alcohol has impaired my brain so that it is not half as good as it once was. All the greater glory is due to Providence, "Who has saved your life by means of so poor an agent. As Ella said to nie, 'God would not permit such a great wi-ong to be done as that you should suffer unjustly.' " Again we all sat in silence for some time, and Ella at least, I think, was returning thanks where thanks were due. Sandoivn broke in upon our thoughts by remarking, "I might have known that Cassidy would be cute enough to have some poison about him. A man like him would commit suicide any day- in prefereiice to going to gaol for some years." "As you. obliged me by not arresting him too soon, Mr. ..Sandown, you shall lose nothing by his death. Mr. Summers has promised that your commission in the mat ter of the land: sale shall come to over two hundred pounds." The detective, who liad worn a very solemn face since Lessing's death, bright ened up at once. "Thank you, sir," he said. "I always like to Have to do with gentlemen." Ella and Keith were married in June, and shortly afterwards sailed for England. A little later the land in Melbourne was sold. It realised the handsome sum of �36,897, to give the exact figures. And now it is a fortnight before the Christmas of the year in which these events took place. It is the afternoon, and I am sitting in the diningroom at my cousin's station. The room is pleasantly cool, as there is a roof of shingles beneath the iron one. This .morning I received a letter from Ella. It runs:� "Dear Cousin Anthony, � Keith and I will be home in time for Christmas. I think I shall he glad to get back to the sunny skies and wide, quiet, restful largeness of Aus tralia. It was lovely here when the lanes were lined with wild roses, and it was plea sant later on when autumn turned the green ' of the leaves, to golden browns; but now the trees are bare, and I vagree with the new.ehum Australian who arrived in Eng land at tliis time: of the year, and remarked tlTat .it was .a mistake to ;.ringbark all the timber. I. hope you have kept tlie pro mise you made me to write down the whole history of Keith's trial, so that lie and I can read it when we grow old. I hone, too, you have not softened. How cruel I was to him once. . I "need to be reminded, of it, for the dear fellow has always spoiled me, . and continues to do so still. I have seen all your relations, who send many kind mes sages to you, which I will deliver as soon as I sec you, and that will be in about n week from the time you get this letter. I have written to father,- asking him and Aunt Jane to spend Christmas with us, so you will have plenty of company soon. "Meanwhile, I remain, dear Anthony, "Your ever affectionate cousin.
