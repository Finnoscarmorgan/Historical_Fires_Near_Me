 CHAPTER IX.-(Continued.) 

 By "BULLOO." 

 Mike Finnegan was undoubtedly the leaser, although he had the smallest share in the station, not only forming the plans for raiding the neighbouring 

 stations but being the most active parti cipator. He was a tall, slightly built pian, of thirty-five yeara of age, but his oracles were like steel and his strength equal to his activity, which was very great. His temperament was sunny, his eyes blue and merry, surmounted by a crop!#f curly brown hair. He was a per fect bushman, being an excellent tracker, a fine shot with either rifle or revolver, while hits admirers boasted' truthfully "he bad never seen the buexjumper that could �pill him." When the other men came in Phil Hardy failed to recognise any of them, and was equally assured no member of the gang knew him, although he was sub jected to a keen scrutiny. When the evening meal had been con sumed and the men were sitting about smoking Phil told them how he had left Victoria to see something of the new country that was being so much talked ?bout, and admitted he had never seen finer grating land in his life, not even barring the western district of his na tive B*ate. "I guessed you was a Victorian when I twigged your ridin' breeches," inter jected Sam Butler with a knowing grin. /"You. 1 Victorians all come up here with ridin' breeches, but soon drop 'em ; "Thsjt Koolparrl run's good," continued Phi:, "but I didn't like the boes. He's too infernal lofty for me. He offered me a Job, ;but I reckoned I'd go farther on." "How did you find your way over here?" inquired Mike with a pleasant smile. "0n? of the stockmen told me about your place and gave me a start on a creek that runs up to the divide, and all �I had to do then was to come on due west. He seemed a decent kind of a chap, very different to a blatherin' kind of a galoot they called JLiarry. I felt inclin ed to put a plug in that Larry's Jaw once or twice. He was bio win' how they bad licked you chaps, too, and swore you'd never come again." "Ah !" muttered Mike, while the others exchanged startled glances. Phil Inew he was touching on danger ous ground, but proceeded in his assumed harsh voice, "It's all darned fine for blokes like them to skite about other chaps 4uffln' a few cows, but I wouldn't like to trust any of that push in reach of a little mob of cleansklns. The coves that blow about honesty so much in my experience have somethin' to hide. At Kangatook, where I was livin', the best man got the most calves, and if I won this time perhaps you'd do best next time." "I heard there was none of that in your country," remarked Harry Butler. "No more there isn't now. I was Just comin* to that. A bloke named Mon tague bought the next run, Quambing, and swore he wouldn't allow his men to do any duffin', and he'd put the law on his neighbours if they did. It was baily rotten, you know, for the Quambing chaps had made a good scoop on us a few weeks before while we were beltln' out a bush fire on the other side of the run, nnd the joke was badly on us. They rubbed it in, too, for they let their bally cattle on to our country, and we didn't like the looks of the new men they had." "Some of our chaps said the game was up and they wouldn't risk anything, but there was no love lost between me and their head stockman, Bill Short, and one day when we met in the township we got to it and I gave him a lamming, telling him as he went away that I'd have another haul in spite of him. I was up to my word, too, for I got two other chaps wound up, ami one dark night we touched 'em for about 20 head. We were hustlln' along when four blokes rode out of a clump of stringy bark saplin's and Went for us. Of course we did a bunk, but two of 'em were in front of me, and one of 'em grabbed my arm. There was nothin' else for it, so I let him have the butt of my stockwhip over the nap per and down he went. I dodged the other, Bill Short, but the beggar knew me and called my name after me. "Fortunately I had got my* money a frw days before, so I made up my swag and cleared for Ballarat, where I saw in the paper the man I had stoushed was the new boss of Quambing, and he was not expected to live. It went on to say that although the cattle stealer had bolt ed the police had a clue to his where abouts and expected to land him shortly. You guess I didn't waste much bally t.me in gettin' out of that, and I drew some sweat out of my prads till I got to the Darling, where I felt a bit safer. So here I am, and reckon old Victoria will never.see me again." There was silence for a few minutes, during which the Butlers were wondering if he would make any further confidences, and Mike was thinking deeply. 

 Phil, feeling the silence, rose and plac ing a fire stick to his pipe after a few puffs said : "After all, I'm not altogether sorry I came away ; the country down there is getting full of cockles, and there's no room for a fellow that likes a fife life. So, as I said, here I am, and if you want another hand I'm on. What's tbe Bcrew ?" "Thirty bob," replied Harry Butler. "We're not pushed for help, but we'll be musterin' presently, and you can come on if you like for a few weeks." Harry had received a nod from Mike before add ing the last few words. Accepting bis host's decision nonchalant ly, Phil sprawled at full length and smoked silently. As some of the Camardeen men had been in Victoria and Phil had spent two years there he was able to interest them with yarns about that State�or colony as it was then called�and they could not dispute his statements, even if they doubted their authenticity. Before a week had passed Phil had been freely accepted at his face value and enjoyed the fullest confidence of the rattle stealers, so that when the weather showed manifest signs of breaking he had no difficulty in getting away and sending up three or four smoke signals from the top of the range, indicating the party were preparing for a descent : upon the Koolparri cattle. The clouds were gathering thickly in the South when the party, composed of the two Butlers, Mike Finnegan, Duncan, and Phil, topped the range and descend ed the Eastern watershed by means of the gorge. , Mike, leaving the others, made. 

 straight for a spot where a faint cloud of dust indicated a mob of cattle were camped and throwing up the eartu to dislodge the flies that, in myriads, an noyed them. "About 700 head," he muttered. "There ought to be some good pickings there. Now for a scout round," A complete circle Bhowed him there were no fresh horse tracks in the vicinity and he rode back to his companions, when he was very much annoyed to find Phil lying under a tree looking very sick. "What's up ?" he demanded. "Phil's been awful sick," replied Harry Butler. "He's pretty near chucked his inside up." "What caused it, Phil ?" he inquired. "Can't say. I feel infernally qixer, but I'm a bit better now, and may be all right in a couple of hours." "Can you ride at all ?" demanded Mike. "No ; I'm too giddy. I'll be Letter by the time you're back." Mike and the others, proceeded en their way, and Phil, who was very white, for he had poked a crow's feather down his throat, smiled grimly. His first inten tion was to ride straight away towards Koolparri, but on reflection he realised bis treachery would be exposed if through any reason his companions did not at tempt to get the cattle. Several plans suggested themselves, and finally he mounted and rode until he saw the camp dust, when he sat on his horse under a tree and awaited developments. He was not long kept in suspense, for three revolver shots sounded faintly through the timber, followed by several others, and resolving to take part in the fray be galloped forward. In less than half-a-mile he met Mike 

 with one of tbe Butlers lying across his knees flying at top speed towards the gorge. He half checked his horse to in quire what had happened, so as to maintain an appearance of innocence, when Mike fired full in his face crying, "You treacherous dog !" Phil fell from his bor?e and lay still. When Jack and his little band saw the cattle duffers approaching tbe camp they crept silently forward to within 5U yards of the cattle and crouched behind bushes, being only a few yards apart. Mike and his men lost no time in be ginning work, and soon had a fine lot of weaners cut out from the mob. They looked longingly at some beautiful well bred calves, but realising they would be difficult to drive without their mothers started the wean ers towards the gorge. This was the moment our friends had been waiting for, and picking their men flrtd. Larry had naturally marked Dan can, and although he was seventy yards away shot him through the Ire.st and the horss galloped away riderless. Hardy shot Mike through the left shoulder, and Jack sniped Harry Butler, who was riding close to Mike. He fe!l against the latter, who pulled him across his sadd o and turning fired four shots at Jack and Larry, striking the latter in the thigh. Jack's second shot took effect in the younger Butler's back cs he galloped away. The lad threw up his crms and fell to the ground, but his foot caught in tbe stirrup and be was dragged through the bushes for half a mile be fore it became freed. In spite of the wound in his leg Larry 

 ran to bis fallen foe, who was lying on his face apparently dead. To make the matter certain he turned him over on bis bs.ee, when Duncan, with all his teeth bared in snarling hate, attempted to raise bis pistol ; but he was too weak, and Lexry kicked the weapon out of his nerveless hand. The would-te murderer died in a few minutes s;eechle-8, but bis eyes spoke their undying hate. Larry's wounded thigh was attended to and boand up. Fortunately the ball bad gone through and come out, so there was no painful probing to be done, and he declare! he was all right. Feeling certain Sam Butler would be found not far off, they followed his horse's tracks, and recovering the body carried it back to where Duncan's was lying. Had the dead men been blacks their bodies would have been burned and the incident practically closed ; but that could not be done with white men, and they considered what course to pursue. Finally it was decided to bring tools from tbe station and bury tbe corpses where they were, sending word to tbe police at Charleville ; so Jack and Larry rode away, leaving Hardy to guard the bodies. The occupation proving monotonous the latter followed Hike's tracks to ascertain it he had succeeded in carrying off Harry Butler. He knew he had hit him and thought it possible he would te soon compelled to abandon bis burden from loss of blood. He had not gone far when he saw a horse feeding without a rider, and presently discovered Phil ljing on his back apparently dead, his face and 

 breast covered with blood. Dismounting, he found the young fellow's heart was beating and that his wound consisted of a gash across the temples, the skull being uninjured. Muttering an inward prayer of thank fulness, he hung his brother's horse to a tree and placing the unconscious man across his own saddle carried him back to the camp, where a plentiful supply of cold water soon restored him to his senses. The brothers were thankful they had come so wall out of the fight, for both Mike and Dune in were fine shots besides being reckless men. "It was the surpriss did it," said Phil. "If you had not managed it so well some of you would have been shot to a cer tainty." �'I wender wh:it made him suspect you," said Hardy. "Goodness know? ; but he knew it all right when he fired at me. He must have had some lingering suspicion of me, I sup pose. Anyhow, be knew It and nearly had me." When Jack and Larry reached ths head station the Tatter's leg was so swollen that he was compelled to take to his bunk, and Jack, placing food and tools on a packhorse, returned to the scene of the fight. The bodies were buried next morning, when the three returned to Koolparri. The following day Phil Hardy started for Charleville conveying a letter from Jack to the police magis trate informing him of what bad oc curred and requesting instructions. In a few days he returned with a sergeant of police, a mounted constable, and a letter stating the P.M. could not attend, but requesting Jack to obtain Roger Wilson's services�he was a J.P. �to hold an inquiry. In due course Wilson arrived and writ ten statements were taken down by the sergeant, Roger Wilson's reports also being handed to him. Although there was no hop: of catching Mike Finnegan or Harry Butler, even if the latter were alive, the polic: visited Camardeen, where they found the young est brother, Dan Butler, and a stcc'.;man. From the latter they learned Harry had died the day following the encounter, and that Mike, who had not been danger ously wounded, had gone away. "The last words he said to me," add ed the man, "were, 'I'll mark them Kool parri skunks yet,' and I bet he will some day when they've forgotten ell about it " t _ Jkfr*"acf ounV"T?t ths fray of course got �*o\\th�}saiipiB\\and Koolparri tecame flulte""noted7 �Ce\\clev�r defeat of the ''rattle duffers'* being heartily commended. thttv'Hardy* wefted the promised re- L^iaMjnand washed /to remain on Kool- V*rri, but-lhd-.lfrotber would net listen ?to-44h^�tfrGvg/�Mike Finnegan would re- VuU'l vomer^day and exact a terrible "You must go bac't to the Inside coun try," he said, ''and the farther South the better.

It is not surprising that the Koolparri fight, as it was called, created great excitement throughout the district, and many travellers made a point of stopping at the station to obtain a full and parti cular account of the affair. Jack became heartily tired cf it, but Larry was in his glory, and the stcry lost nothing in its repetition. By degrees he had assumed the leadership cf the whole matter. He had procured Phil Hardy from New South Wale 3, had instructed him how to pro ceed and had led the attack. His brag ging, however, a t lcnjtb led to a personal encounter between him and a traveller who stayed for the night on his way up the river to Tarabo. The stranger was horsey from head to foot, wearing a cabbage tree hat, a calf- B'jin waistcoat, and well-fitting black trousers strapped with white moleskin. His boots were secured with a large silver buckle and he wore a snakeskin belt. He was onlj five feet seven tall and not beavily built, but he was beauti fully proportioned, being a young fellow who, to the expert eye, promised to be a good all round man. He had listened quietly during the evening to Larry's gasconading, making no remark, but in the morning when they were saddling up Larry began again, when giving his saddle a final shake, he turn ed, saying ; "I heard down the river you were a howling skiter, and now I know it," and smiling scornfully at Larry's astonished silence he added, "and you're an infernal liar." Larry sprang at him and they en gaged in a furious fight. Hardy, hearing the noiae and perceiving they were using only their fists, looked on, while wonder ing what c -uld have caused the trouble. Larry was both heavier and taller, which stood him in good stead, for his opponent was apparently the finer boxer. A number of blows had been exchanged when they closed, both falling. "Time!" cried Hardy, but the enraged men re gained their feet and flew at one another again without having attempted to strike a foul blow, evidently each thinking he wrp the better man. The fight continued for forty minutes, during which the contestants had punish ed one another severely. 

 "Don't you think jou've both bad enough ?" demanded Hardy? "I can donkey-lick him," replied Larry, "and I'm goin' to." "Come on, then," replied the other, and the fight recommenced. Jack and Nerangi had been spectators from the veranda and kitchen .respect ively, and were of course as much at sea as Hardy regarding its cause, but the former thought it was time the fight was over and walked across to the tent. He had just joined Hardy, when the combatants swung their right hands, each getting home on the other's jaw and falling. "We'll stop it now," exclaimed Jack. "They must surely be old enemies." � "They didn't show any signs of it last night" was the reply, "and I can't begin to guess what caused it." As the men staggered to their feet Jack stepped between them, Baying : "This has got to stop ; you've both had enough, and I won't have any more of it." "He called me an infernal, skiting liar," spluttered Larry through his swollen lips. "So you are," retorted the other^Ma unclosed eye flashing fire, and they n?ne at one another again ; but Jack and Hardy had little difficulty in holding the exhausted men apart. "What is it all about ?" demanded Jack, with a view towards a settlement of the quarrel. "Why did you call him � liar T" "That's my business" was the sullen reply. "But I'll give any man the same who says Mike Finnegan's a eneakln' thief." "Oh !" ejaculated Jack, noting tbe traveller's curly brown hair. "Well, you've vindicated Mike's reputation as far as in your power, for there are very few in this side of the country can stand Larry off for a quarter of an hour, much less nearly an hour. You had better shake hands now." Larry attempted a friendly smile, but the traveller, leading his horses to the water, washed his face and remounting rode away. "It strikes me if Mike has a brother that's he," remarked Jack ; "so I sup pose the trouble arose through Larry speaking of the fight at the gorge." "How the dickens wrs I to know it was his brother ? I'd have held my jaw if I had. J expect he came up here on purpose to lam me, but, by gum, I don't think he'll try it again. If he does I'll whack his bally socks off, and his mother won't know him for a year.'j?L "Oh, go and wash yourself or ywr borse will shy at yon," retorted Jade with a laugh as he turned away. In due course Alec and Toby returned with tire droving horses, the former bear ing all sorts of kind messages from Jack's numerous friends and an urgent request that he should revisit them. Don had almost tearfully' begged to be allow ed to accompany his brother, but had been refused, being finally somewhat re conciled by a promise be should go up to Koolparri the following year. Nothing had been seen or heard of the Wild blac'ss, but an elderly fellow known es Cobby, his two gins, and a Bmall child had come in from the Paroo oller ing to tring up the horses, in the morn ings. Toby, anxious to escape the duty, for it was net pleasant to tramp through dew laden, long grass on frosfy mornings, strongly-advocated their employment, suggesting the gins could look after some milking cows if they were broken in. "That's a good idea," thought Jack. "There are one or two old milkers in the herd and we'll get them in. Milk in the tea will be n great improvement to our fare." Accordingly two cows were driven In, though as their calves had been weaned they were useless for milking purposes, but two newly calved well-bred heJjws were brought in with them, and the r animals served to keep them within bounds. One heifer caused no trouble, but the other strongly objected to the bail and had to be roped and forced in. Nerangi was the milkman, and by the exercise of considerable patience succeeded in taming her ; but she was not completely con quered, as was proved one morning when all except Alec had gone away early, the latter suJtering from an attack of sandy blight which had rendered one eye quite blind and had half closed the other. The lad was bathing his eyes with warm water when Nerangi appeared at the door exclaiming. " That cantankyrous Daisy's up to her tricks agen and won't bail up. Will you come and give us a hand ?" 

 Mike fired full In his face.
