DAN�LYONS' DOOM SBy WAI:WANDER.: : CHA lIT I.. OOEOBIOOTITON. 'tAre thiself tie :place ?" thie. tall; refieod looking-young man asked; as he.seated him-' self on a stone upon the hillUside and sur veyed the country at his feet. " This is farranga you have talked to me so much about,.Tady ?" "'Tis, miether Leonard; we are in it at last, praises be. There farenint yeou is big lMount loban, with the little-township lying at the pit of 'it, juost the same as it was twelve years ago. � Andnow looklbelow.you to your right; do yon see the low house wid the trees a'most a-top of it, and Ioban Creek creeping along by itlike a thread iof:ilver In the grass ? Well, tbat'e St.'Herrick's plane.". "Ah, I see it, Tady;;and -your-golden olaim; where did it lie?". ; "Where it lies yet, please God., Do you see the, big dead -tree osticking white like a skeleton, out of the, slope behind-the house ? The claims were not twenty yards from that." 'Well; now Tady, just tell me the story of the St. Herrick'e:on the spot while I smoke a pipe. It <has always seemed'to-mie a very noreal etory.; perhaps I:may feel -more like crediting it if :I hear It here on the spot from which I can see.the scene itself." -: "Yoe, woer.; ever an': always a hard noti miether;Leonardiand Iwouldn't-believe the priest himself it he wint against' you; but 'ere you areenow, afther travellin' thoneande aymiles to make a ,liar.of me an' yoncean't Leonard Preseer laughed pleasantly as he nIanipulated-his tobacco, and-looked alyly at the comioal figure -seated' near'hini on the grass. : . : ::- - -' "I don't know so' much about that, Tndy. What witnesseaehave youeat:Marrangs?" -, "I was just wonderin',",Tady returned, thoughtfully. - "If.he's here yet, there's a, gentleman lives in one of them white houses beyant the bridge that can tell you the story as well as I can, an' bedad, he maU tell it, for I won't neveragain.. I'm tired of being mis believed andmitsdoubted." "If I'thoight.you were in earnest, I'd go shtaight back to:Cnrbally again," the young man replied, laughingly, as he put a match to his pipe and began' to smoke enjoyably,! but I know that, you cannot wish for a greater proof ofmy' confidencein you than that I should bave-:fllowod you half round the world to see Marraiga and the lost claim." "That's true;, sur, but all the same I'd like Mr. Pdllard'to tell yeu about it, if ho'e to" the fcre;'but twelve years is a long time." "Who was Mr. Pollard?" - ".!!He'was: a magietrate, an' 'a groat' friend intirely of Colonel St. Horrick's. But here, I'll say no more till we go down to the town. ship. See, there's the coach just turnin' rond the Gap road -she'll get in an hour be oSus'." , . The young gentleman did: not reply.' :He was thoughtfully scanning the landsoanle be neath and around him' with the doubly in tense enjoyment of a lover of nature debarred from a view of her, charms for the many weeks occupied by a'long sea voyage;,and thinking not a little about, the events con= nented with the St. - Horricle, of, whom- he' hades oftenheard from his humble friend, Thideas Conoor. As they are.seated -there, sil?ntlyit me describo the two dissimilar beings who play no uneventful part in this story. Leonard Prosser was twenty-three, and a picture of handsome and muscular health. In his bronzed face, every feature indicated an intelligent and loveable nature, his dark hazel eyes especially having the elar, .frank expreesion 'of a thodughtful yet frank,.and fearless nature. He was attired in eaervice able, wellout tweed, and had a soft brown fel hat on his short brown curls. Thadeus Connor was thirty.five, if a day, aud wea about an ordinary a specimen of hunanity as you could imagine. He was shoot of stature thin.limbed and big.jointed. His arms were too long for the size of his little form, and his eyes, set deep in their sockets under pent-houses of red hair, were ery and small like a ferrets. His round shoulders and odd figure were oeaggerated by Stightly.fitting coat and trousers of a bright blue, decorated amnly with brass buttons, and a brilliant peneock feather was stuck in the front of his stiff, low-crowned black hat. A very glittering Albert denoted the presence of Awatch in his pocket, and a great gold ring adorned one of his stumpy little ingers. Te expression of every line of his form and eery twinkle of his little eyes was of cunning and self-conceit, but thoso who knew the little Irishman well could have told how true and faithful was the heart few gave him credit for possessing. "There's a path close to us on the right; ronder where it goes to?" said Leonard, braking tso silence at last. "The place where the Colonel was buried 0 dup there on the side of the hill," replied t he haman, as he turned his face over his bhoulder to saon the track alluded to; "but by the piper that played before- Moses, wherever it goes to there's an angel comin' down it?" As was onlnatural, yocng Prossr, turned 41o to see what had drawn the exlamation fe mhis humble friend, and he too saw tbaicng along the green fair hillasde, a form I~a lght at leastiave been one ina dream of Sso5 sweet and adnsrthlny it was in the 

 faireet lovelinoss. It was a young girl of elevdn or twelve years, followed by a cool. black Newfoundland dog. So strange alto. gether was the appearance of this child that Leonard Prosser hesitated ere he decided she was truly an inhabitant of this lower world. About eleven years old, as I have said, the girl was small for her age, and by far too delicately' slender. She was attired in a pale blue dress, over which fell down to her very waist a cloud of the most lovely fair hair that ever grew on a child's head. It was not golden fair, but of that far rarer hue that re. sembles the side of a young fawn with the gloss of satin on every hair. Th pale face, overshadowed by the drooping brim of a broad Tuscan hat, was so delicately outlined in every feature that no waxen one was ever more perfectly modelled, nor yet had a brighter rose on its cheeks, and in every line of the face and form there was expressed a calmness and peace that was surely not of this world. As the girl neared the men 'she looked at them steadily, and without a trace of fear in the soft blue eyes over which the fair lashes fel' like a veil; but the great 'dog moved "oteadily to her aide and examined. the friends cautiously as she, paused before them and spoke. "You are strangers ?" she asked gently. "Yes, quite strangers," Leonard replied, with a smile that at once assured the child she was addressing 'one who.was to be trusted.' h' We hav' 6nly come to Marrrniga within thu hour; and'yo ? " i II- oh ram io'stranger.; I was born at Marranga." ' - There was a pause;in 'which' Tady's Small eyes seemed to settle themselves on,. the child's face with a great wonder in them. "Are you the gentleman who has taken St. Herrick'as ?' she asked hesitatingly, as, she gazed at Leonard, while she held more closely to her breast a cluster'of golden;blossoms she was earrying. 'I think not'; we have as yet made' no arrangements for residing at Marranga." "'I beg your pardon," the child said gently; ' St. Herrick's was mama's home once, and we heard some gentleman had rented it. JI did so hope it would be some one nice." The last sentence was repeated thought fully, as her eyes wandered down to the low house among the trees that Tady had pointed out as St. Horrick'e. "Stay Miss," the Irishman said eagerly,sae the girl was turning to go on her way. "Aro you a St. Herrick? " "Yes, I amliesignation St. Herrink-thelate Colonel St. Herrick 'wasmy father." ' 'II thought so," Tady rind, " you have the poor Colonel's eyes as like as two poea.", " Mbama says so ; did you know him? did you know my dear father?" and the rosy flush ,spread from the soft cheeks all overithe' fair face, . ' ' "Yes, Miss, I knew him well., I was here at Marranga I suppose before you were born." "Yes, it must have been. Papa was dead before I was born, that is the reason mama called me Resignation. Did you love my 'apa?" : ' - "Everyone respected andliked him 1" Tady said quickly. "' d, not everyone; there was a bad man you forget-the man who killed him."'; "Yes, the ourse o' God on him, I forgot Dan Lyons I" Tady cried angrily. "Hush, do not speak wrong words. God knows best himself... May .I shake hands with you because you know.my dead:papa? " "God bless the. child I " the honest.Irish." 'masnaid, as he clasped the little slenderhand that was tendered him. . '' You will shake hands with me, too,:as. a new friend? My name isLeonard Presser," the 'young gentleman said, putting ot his hand 'aleo, "and 'vill.youointroduom me .to 'your dog? Dogs and -I are always great friends." � "My dog is called Guardian, sir, for he takes'care of me, and is a very" faithful dog. Are you going to stay here sir? '. " Yes, dear, we think of remaining for some time near Marranga." ' I am glad, I shall see you again. Good. bye now." and the child made a grave bow to Leonard and Tady, and then glided down the, path toward St. Herrick's. "Isn't that.quaro now?? .the Irishman asked as.they stood and watched the light form.passing through the. underwood that. skirted the eminence on which' they had been seated,." that we should meet: Colonel Her. riek's ;daughter the very first'on landing in th place?" , "It is a.strange coinidenoo, truly.. This child, was not born then, when you left Mar, ranga, Tady? !' , :: "' No, but one was expected.if the meother. lived. God help her, it was ashard trial she had to boar.-- What do you .say togotting down to- the township now Mr. Leonard ? The, coach is nearly, in, and we'd better be ceein' afther our thraps." - CHAPTER II; H '. A few, hours iater found: Leonard Prosser and his companion, tholittle Irishman, seated in Mr. Pollard's office at Marranga, and Tady jubilant over ' the. fact' of that' gentleman being still a residant of that neighborhood. He. had- introduced his young: master, and given the J.P. a sketch of his doings during his absence from Australia, and now he was greedily inquiring as to the events of the last twelve years in quiet Marranga. i " And so you tell me that a pick has never been struck in them claims since, Mr. Pol lard ? " :. "Not since our poor friend's exhumation, Tady. None of the claims had paidwell, you know, and they were abandoned after that awful murder. Even you wont, Tady." S" I wint, yes," the Irishman said aggrese ively'; "'but 'twasn't on account of the bad prospect, for we had the best in No. 2, bhut on -?count of the place gettin' a bad name-you know that yourself, sir." "Y' e, a story of the claim being haunted got abroad, andevery shaft was deserted; but as I said before, there was not much temptas tion-no lead was ever found." "I don't know that," obatinately asserted Tady, " I had a fool of a mate, or I.believe we were on the right track. An' thin' I got the master's letter callin' me home to look either Mr. Leonard here." " He means my father," explained the young gentleman. "You must know that Tody and I are foster brothers, and his jaunt out to the diggings was an escapade of which his friends did not approve." " Well, I'm back again in spite of 'em," said Tady; and now, Mr. Pellard, tell Mr. Leonard thle story-no one knows it better nor your. It wasa sad'story,"'jtho pleasant-looking, middle-.agd genitleman went on, as he pushed the wino toward 'his new friend, youag tLeonard ; " and agr?et shook to me personally was the death--ol my- friend, Colonel St. Herriek. It is about fifteen years ago now, I think, since be first settled hero with a wifc, as beautiful as an angel, and a son who died shortly after their arrival at Mar range. n" The colonel had some independent means, and built the house known yet as St. Her. rick's on the ground he purchased; bat when, some yeare after; the gold fever found its way to efarcnnga, he was one of the Srct who sunk aeshaft and found, as he considered, suf thlentiindlIcations of the precious metal to indnce further efforts. "'For someltime, however, he could not seuceedininduling anyone to join him,thetfe' 

 residents being ooupied in' farming, or busi ness of one kind or other, and the place hav ing not yet become known'suflfiiently to en coorage regular diggers. At last, however, the Colonel came to me one day in great spirits with the news that he had employed a man who had accidentally called in travelling toward the Murray. "It was some time, however, before St. Horriok told me that ho had been previously and unfavorably acquainted with Dan Lyons, and when the facts came out and were made publio there were many who wondered that my friend would have ventured on such a step as permitting the man to work as his partner, as well as become an inmate of his home. The facts appeared to be that in Ireland, through the evidence of St. Herrick, Dan Lyons had been sentenced to ten years penal servitude for shooting with intent at a land bailiff, whom'he was obnoxious to, and that the evidence was never forgiven, the murder of poor St. Herriok was a proof." "It was Dan Lyons, thlien, who committed the foal dead?" Leonard questioned. ' "Undoubtedly, though the wretch has es caped and baled justice. It was Lyonshim. eelf that gave the alarm that No. 1 claim had fallen in. You remember that, Tady ? " ! Av coorse, I mind it well. There was a regular hallabulleo when he kem to No. 2 screethin' that the claim was fell in, an' that the Colonel was below. There was only four shafts an' half of 'et deserted, and reound about No. 1 was so druv wid drives that we know 'twae unsafe to stand anear where, the great gap of ground fell in. The way 'twas done at last was by putting a driveoin-from No. 4,an' it took us three days to do it.' Aye," responded Mr. Pollard,~ three ter. rible days for the poor widow who would hopet the last, though we all knew thatthe Colonel must have perished for want of air shortly after the ground fell in. Lyons pre tended to be one of the most active workers, but he w'asein reality retarding the. searob, and he disapjpeared from the moment that St. Herriek's corpse was seen with a note-book in one 'stiffened hand and a pencil in the other." ". The poor fellow had left evidenco against hie murdeer ?' , "Yes. In the few. scrawled words written in darkness and'in the oppressiaon of death, he told how Lyons had cut away the props and told him of the revenge he had planned--. told him of. it era he, escaped himself, and while theosoil was slowly-settling down be., tween him and his viotim. There was no more but a blessing oni his wife and his un born bab'e. .' "We saw the little girl to-day," Leonard said, and ho,related what had passed between R~esignation and them. " Sheis a lovely girl," he added, " but look very delicate." '!She has grown up with the very shadow of the grave on her," Mr. Pollard returned. " The very name given her was the, last, that should have been chosen, for her mother has. never been and never will be resigned. . She nourishes a morbid idea that .somehow and some day she.will see her husband's mur. derer brought to justice here on the' spot where' he died, and the dead father, is al. most the sole subject of conversation between her and her little girl." " Whore do they live now?" Tady asked. "In a little house' I had built for' them' altertthe Colonel'es death. On his' affairs being settled it was found that there wase' but a few hundreds left after the housee and land was paid off. St. 'Herricks being putin: the. market, I bought' it:myeelf,.and' oflered' to take Mrs. St. Herrickas as a tenant; but she'de olared'it would be impossible to remain where she �had been so happy; and' where every.' thing would remind her of her dead husband, so I built the cottage where they, now live ; it is 'on tho slope above the old plae, Tady; you will remember it ?" " Yes, sir, well." " The property has been a loss'to' me," the good man continued, "for a' story? of' its' being haunted stood in the way' of its being occupied. Now, however;'I have just eooured a tenant whose profession' ought to prevent any soupoertttioeus terrors-" from affecting him ." , '."' " '' " What is he?" "By his dress, I should say a member of some religious order, and hisemother calls him" eFather James." " He has a family, then?":' '? A'. mother and sister, and 'one nerving man,'as far as' I could see; And now about yourselves."' 'You really mean: to "attack thieold'ground again, Tady?"' ':' Wi' the help o' God. I'i''as 'hre as I sit here that there's lumps of gold in that gully, Mr. Pollard." =W. Well I hope there ny be, fioryour'aken;, and Mr: Leonard's too. Where are you going rbut up?" � . "At the hotel, for the present; Mr.' Pol. lard,": replied Leonard.: " I must' have alook at these wonderful claims before ITdecide on' entering on the lifelof a digger, for I must confess that I don't at all share -Tady's cer tainty of a golden claim." '" More shame for you to say it,"!.'ried Tady,.angrily, as he got up fromhis' seat; bhot if you're comin', we have no time to lose, Mr. Leonard." " - " .. ' We had proposed a visit to' the claims," young Prosser explained. '! It is'not a long walk, I believe." - '" About half a mile only. Stay Mr: Pros. ser;'if you have'no objectione I will walk with you. It is years einee I saw the place, which has, as you may suppose, sad 'rcollee-. tions for me." It was a lovely spring afternoon; and'as the trio crossed ihoban Creek and mounted the slope beyond, it was an almost simul taneous impulse that slackened their steps to admire the scene around them. The gliding waters of the creek, gliatoning among its fringes of ' sweestoented flowering wattle; the stately Mount Roban, heaving up his huge sides, laden with their wealth of forest, flushed in the warm, bright sunbeams; the sweep of fair pasture, dotted for miles with content sheep and cattle, until lost in the low line of blue hills. in the distanooe-all formed 'as sweet a landscape as Leonard Presser had ever gazed upon. "It is lovely," he said, "and so different from what I fancied. My idea of Tady's dig gings was of something wild and rough, and not of a loveliness such as this." "In ton minutes you will see something more like what you expected, Mr. Prosser," observed the J.P. " The gully is even wilder now than when you left it, Tady.. The curse of shed blood seems to be on its very grass." Turning to the right they passed the over grown garden that surrounded the dwelling known as "St. Herricks," and then entered a gully wild enough to fulfil all Leonard's dreams. It seemed to be a cleft in the hills down which the dry track of a winter torrent, and up the sloping sides of which streaggling trees grow, and wild folige flourished rankly. Here and there were broad levelspots that had been swept in winters gone by from the green hill sides, and toward one of these level places the stelops of Mr. Pollard turned. A spot that looked weird enough to justify all that Mr. Pollard had said of it, where the grass vainly struggled to hide' the suolenlevel and the thrown up heaps that denoted the place where they had dug to recover the body o[ a foully-murdered man. Huge trees with. out one sign of leafy verdure on them stretohed their bare, bleak, crooked limbs over it'as if in warning and guard, and among the scarred, hard soil, where no grass would grow, a few treaoherous holes wi~th lichons waving long tendriledown their cavernous depths, denoted 

 where the deserted shafts of the long ago miners had been. "Is this at all like what you expected, Mr. Leonard ?" the gentleman asked, as he paused on the edge of the sunken level. "It is worse," almost whispered the young man, while Tady gazed around him with horror. "I scearcely wonder that men would be unwilling to work here, even for gold. What do you asy, Tady ?" " I don't know what to say, sir; there's an awful change here sure enough, and they say that a curse will always lie where a man has been killed. What happened the trees,.Mr. Pollard? They were fine box trees twelve years ago." "There was a bush fire that 'helped the desolation, I believe, Tady. Can you point out your old claim ? " "For sure, sir. The Colonel's No. 1 was here where the ground's low, and our's was that one boyant there, whore the green thing is swinging about." They advanced to theo edge of Tady's old shaft and looked down into the darkness.. Leonard lifted a stone and threw it down, and as it splashed into hidden- water the Irish. man shuddered as if a cold wind had struck him. " I think your 'gid-digging, at" Marranga will never,be resumed, Tady;" young Proesser said. ' There is water, down there;,and a flooded claim is nojoke to tackle, At all events, I resign on the spot all.interest in No. 2,, it would seem: to me like digging. in a grave." SThe place of. graves has not always been repeted in the, search for gold in our new land," observed Mr. Pollard, ' but let' us' go; I own . shall be glad to get away from this melanchbly ;spt. ' What was, I sent here forat all? "mur. mered, the, Iriehean disoontentedly. , '!Day an' night I,was dreamin',of it for eleven year; warninsof all soits, I had to come back again to th.duld, place; what was it for if 'twas not for the goold'?. . "Maybe 'twas to meet the prieet, Tady,', Leonard said tmilingly. "Isthis your new tenant, approahing, air. Pollard? I should judge so from his dreos." . " Yes, it is he," replied Mr..Pollard, as he panused to speak to the clergyman who was. approaching. - a o 00 srn info.e.s pather James was a man so strange info i and movement as to draw the eyes of both Leoniard and his, foster-brother closely, upon him; he was tall and gaunt in make, and his Idng, priest-like black coat hutng!o loosely around himnias to suggest a debrease in 'bulk sides'it'had been made for him. Indeed, the face, showing. palely under the broad brim of the clerical hat that was drooped over it, was that of an invalid-the 'white, hollow, Close. shaved cheeke, the great, sunken dark eyes, with the bloe cirles. round them,'suggesting a far from perfect state of health. On meet ing him Tady, with the usual respect o his countrymen'for their clergy, made' him a reapeetful reverence, that was acknowledged by a'ourt ndd as the stranger stopped tb speak 'to his landlord, ' "A strange looking man and a sioily neo, I should say," observed Leonard when they, had separated by.some steps. "He belongs to some foreign 'order I think-oeh, Tady ?" "Aye; sir; the dress is different from our' clergy? but what eyes, he hase-they seemed :tolook right through .me, an' I; declare it seeme to me as if I'd seem 'em before some: where". "' Maybe you did, Tady. There were 'tivo or three continental priests at Corbally col. leoting for some charity last sumnmer."'. " I was none-of: them,'Mr. Leonard;, fr Il never lost a mass while they were there, an' I seen 'em all."- . . " I don't think you ever lost a mass if youe could help it,'Tady.:- What will you do here 7? I understand there is oo chapel here." " No I" replied Tady vioiously, "it's mostly Protestants that are at 'Marranga - the hathens; I beg your' pardoh, Mr. Leonard, I was forgettin' you wor one, but you. must own that if- there were as' many Catholics about;the place wouldn't be without a church. or chapel. Well, I'm 'glad; anyhow, that there is a priest;' If he's in orders 'twill be a great comfort to me." ' .They were now rejoined 'by Mr. Pollard, whose pleasant' countenaneeo had a broad smile on it as they moved on, Tady falling, as he always did, a little in the rear. �" You have heard something pleasant from ouio lerieal friend?" said'Leonard. '"I don't know that' it was exactly the agieeable nature of what Father James told me that' tickled me, but 'it' was the idea' of Paddy's sensations when-he hears it. What do you think the priest told me, Tady ?" "'He wouldn't tell you anything had, any-' how,"'the Irishman replied stoutly. , ."Of course not, but something very unex pected. What do you think he is going to do,' Mr. Prosser ? " "I can't guess." '?-:?, " He is going to open up'the'old ground we have just been inspecting. ?;He in going over to seea it pow. He says that he has a' mano with him who knows the ground, and who has a great opinion of the prospects in No. 1 before it was abandoned, and: he's going to take possession of that elaim.- What do you think of that,. Teddy-?": " I'll tell you what I think I " ried Oonnor, triumphantly. "I =think that priest or no prlesthe won't get No, 2 claim, for I'll go back and peg it out this minnit I By Jove, we can set all the ghosts in the country at defiance now when there's a Clergyman in.the ground, an' we'll take plinty ov gold back. to ould Corbally yet afther all, Mr. Leonard I "' OHAPTER' III. Lusa'c his. companions' suddenly, Tady Connor started book toward the'golly they had just left, but long before he reached it he saw the tall, black figure of the priest stand. near. the scattered spot which had'beeu the grave of Colonel St. Herrick, and it seemed to the'Irishman that in spite of the presence of that .old man, the gloom of the spot was deeper, and the gaunt branches of the dead trees even more threatening of aspect than they had been a short hour previons; but he cast the fancy from him with an execration on his own folly. "I was ever an' always a fool with the superstition, an' I must have suoked it wid me mother's milk, for she was just as bad I What'od make the place blaker because the father is there ?" and he trod toward him with a step that made the dry sticks crack, and the dead grass rustle. The clergyman heard the sounds and turned slowly to meet, as he doubtless expeoted, the gentleman he had so lately parted from, but a quick frown shaded the white face. as he drew the broad hot lower over it at sight of Tady Connor. .. . "Mr. Pollard toeld mo that ye wor goine to take up one of the' old claims,. your revereneo, and I came back to tell ye that No. 2 is mine. You see I worked it long ago, and it belongs of right to me, plaze your rovereeee.

Tady'e repentance was quiokly evinced. .. :'!I beg your reverence's pardon, humbly," he said; "but when I think of the scoundrel I forgets myself.'

".I tell you, man, I am not ind orders, and I don't want:any of your reverences," Father James repeated angrily, as he turned his thin white face away from Tady., . !Borra one o' me cares whether you are in orders., or ;not, your .'reverence,", reiterated Tady, Q:At all events, you wor once, an' I knows. my. duty. in reepeot to the clergy. Besides'"--and the speaker dropped his voice and looked around him timorously-" itgives me coainge. to stand here anoar a man that has stood before the altar." "What do you mean ? What- are'you afraid of, you fool? Do you think that a dead man has power to harm'you ?" "No, your reverence; but you know well that the place,where a soul has been parted from.the. body by. foul murder is acoursed.

S"My maeter, your reverence; you'saw him with Mr.Pollard a bit ago," and honest Tady launched into a 'volley of praises all devoted to Mr. Leonard. -. ' .-Very few were the words that the-priest said, but before-he parted from the -voluble Irishman he knew all about his long' ago e. periences' at Marranga, and his :fester brother's wealth and position, while of him. sell' or :family?Tadyfould not carry to'the township one iota of intelligence. " A holy man," was Tady's opinioin; self.: expressed, as he walked to rejoin his 3oung master, "and' I think he has some vow on him, he is so quint and still." -' S'-Aye I Father James had a vow on him, blint it was one that Tady Connor would no more have dreamed of than be would of- robbing a sanristy I Let us follow'the clergymian aid see what was his opinion of the garrulous -Irishman. At the weather-stained gate that opened to the overgrown gardens of .8t. Herrick's, he paused for a little to look down upon the township that was plainly visible from where he'stood, but had any one" been there to watch that pallid . conntenanea they must have -recognised the fact :that- his thoughts were not on the white houses by the roadside, or the: painted bridge over the-creek, near which the V.R. on the board at the white police station was plainly:.visible. In the deep-set eyes a lurid, fire burned. The long fingers with which he cltached,the top bar of the gate seemed to hold it with- a grip of iron,' rigid as the set teeth and compressed lips of the man. - A step oame down the garden.walk, lbut lie did not hear" it; for he 'started when a hand was laid on his arm. - "Has anything 'gone wrong, ; brother.? was the questlohn that' he hehid, and eaw re: peated in the dark face andthe keen eyes bent so near his oiwn. - '! No-yes,"- was' te' ' contradi?tory reply; I have been down at the old place. , : "At the claimse?" ? ed it hi .upset you :,i thought you were0of different'stuff, brother." " -" It was not altogether that; but I met a man there whise presence may be of evil in. ftneae for ue. Do you remember a little Irishman nanled Tady: Connor 'working in the Gully twelve years ago?" "Aye, do I; he was inNo 2.'"? '. -" Well he has coinm back all way from Ireland to'try that claim again, and I:am. afraid of-him." - - "Why? Do you remember im ? Does he know you ?" -"Brother, yon,, haveforgotten ?that Dan Lyons is dead; how should I,'whb have never seen Marranga before,, know this man, or he me?" "I stand corrected,'! the man who called Father James " brother" said ;".yet there are sometimes fancied resemblanoe." - " Yes," interrupted the-priest;', aod` i think this Connor saw something fi'my face that reminded him of the past. I'hope it is not so, but the idea troubled me."' : The brother looked long and steadily into Father James' face, and then he said'with decision "There is not the most distant family re semblance; there is not a line, or a feature, or an expression like Dan Lyons." "That is well. Cornolius, what sort of man was this Connor in those days? Dan Lyons, I think, knew very little about him.' "Connor was a fool; an ignorant,- preju diced, concoeited fool, who would believe any thing you told him, but was very religious in his way. Curso these religious people-they do more mischief than a host of devils! I How did he treat you?" "With the greatest respeot-with oxzagge rated reverence, in fact." "'As a alergymanm, of course" ,' p es - .. : " Oh, then it is all right; in.that cbaracter you can twist Tady Connor round your I' saw another old acquaintane of Dan'."B' "Who,?". - - -" John Pollard." " Ah I did he. see any family likenesa ?" :. " No I am oure he did not. - I told hpn?'o or intention to re-open the claim.' -/ ; ! That's right; and you told him also that you had one of: the old men who understood j" '"Then everything isgoingion -right ; and: now Ithank you had better go in to the 

 mother; she's been awfully restless since you went out."' ' :-Father James ;looked -toward. the west, wherein'a gorgeous robe of red and purple and gold the sun was saying farewell to Marranga, and a strong shudder shook him from head to foot. " Will you. never get over it, brother ?" Cornelius asked, with an almost womanly tenderness; " and you so strong-minded in every other way. You are ready to face the retribution we are working for at any day and any hour, yet you shudder at a phantom of your own fancy." " It is no fancy, Cornelius; I am ready for the living, but not for the dead. Fanoy I Is that fancy? Are these fancy ?" and he held out his emaciated, trembling wrists. ".No, but you are killing yourself by trying to fortify, yourself for the imaginary horrors of the night; the spirits you drink would kill the strongest man alive." . "It does not kill me, I should die without it." He turned toward the house, lialf' hidden by the trees, as he was speaking, and walked toward it, a tall unbending form that seemed shadowy enough to belong to some other world, yet had hidden beneath the black robe all the horrors that the crimes of earth could concentrate into one deed. The house known as St. Horrink's was a low-roofed building of small accommodation, and its dark stone walls were so covered with ivy, that only hero and there where the gleam of small windows made themselves known, could the material of which -it was built-be identified. It had more than the gloomy look, too, of a house untenanted for long years, especially at sunset, when the .tall aypresslike trees east their. long shadows acrose the-threahold." Standing on the threshold as the brothers approached it, was an indolent-looking young girl of low stature and a heavy build. Every feature in her face was heavy, from the snub nose and the slow, dark. eyes,; to the :thick fringe of blackhair, ut straight-anross her low flat forehead. She had a sulky look,!too, as ahe stood there watching her brothers', ap, proach listlessly, and her ungainly-figure was so bedi;ened with soiled finery, in the shape of lace and ribbons that the befringed and be Iounced .black dress looked .shabbier; than even it was under the contrast.; " - '! It isn't bad enough to to be in a gaol;like this, buit we must be starved-waiting forour sapper,"rshe said, sullenly, as Father James pasned; her, and went inside, but Cornelius only laughed in her face as hehe ehucked her fat, heavilymoulded chin. ,._ ; . . -.,;?,? "A. pretty girl like you, Nora, wont baein gaol, as you call it, long. You'll be having no end of sweethearts about you when the Ifarranga boys begin to find you out." - : '! I don't think there's any boys about,'! she said, ?ith a pout of her thick lihp. . n _" That's where you're wrong, -Nora ; there was one asking about you to-day." . - -, '! Now you're up to some of your. larks, Corney," she said,, doubtingly; but her eyes sparkled, and her brother saw it. "! Faith I'm not. - Oh, honor bright, Nora, he saw you through the trees, and he's bound to make youracquaintance."', - "Who is he ?'-. the girl asked eagerly. "?-is name i? Tady Connor," .... :' Tady Connor," she repeated thoughtfully;: and little guessed Cornelius Brady, as he called himself, what a bomb of destruction he had thrown under his .own -roof when he mentioned thename of Tady Connorito his sister Nora. - .-- ... .- ... , In -the kitchen of. St. Herrioks, which, it would seem, was used as a common room by the Brady family, a smoking supper was spread upon .the table, at whioh a woman ol some sixty.years was, standing when :Father James entered.: She was a tall, thin woman, with strong hands and wiry arms-the hands and arms of- a woman who had worked hard all her life, and was dressed in the;homely fashion of an Irish farmer's wife. Her grey hair was drawn up from her low forehead under. a white, muslin, cap, her -dress was pinned up over, a blue woollen petticoat,'and a checked apron was spread over all the front of her ekirts. -A small, shawl covered. her shoulders, and: was creossed on' her breast, and if a person had oursorily glanced at Mrs. Biady they must. have set her downcas an active, bustling woman, anda notable hbuse wife. - --. ? . .. ,- - - . - (lb be ceestiesne l;) - ,.
