THE OATH OF EDWARD 

 HARE. 

 By IVAN DEXTER. 

 On the afternoon of the 6th January, 1821, a convict gang from Macquarie Har- bour Station, on the West Coast of Van Dieman's Land, were engaged timber-cut- ting in a pine forest near the settlement. 

 It consisted of eighteen felons, in charge of Overseer Hawkins, with a guard of seven soldiers under Lieutenant Cuthbert. At that time the station possessed the most infamous reputation of any penal settle- ment, its tales of horror having since thrilled the world. The transport�e who once passed the harbour entrance, still known as Hell's Gates, might well banish from his heart the last gleam of hope. The swish of the lash ever resounded, while the gallows almost daily had its victims. 

 The wild and inhospitable district ren- dered escape practically impossible. Goaded by the awful agony of bondage, many at- tempts for liberty had been made, only to end in dismal failure. In one case at least the fugitives resorted to cannibalism to sus- tain life, but, even then, as Pearce's confes- sion proved, the surviving runaways ended their dreadful career on the scaffold at 

 Hobart Town. 

 On this afternoon ominous signs of an ap- proaching storm were manifest. To the westward huge banks of clouds had crept above the horizon, and were sweeping to- wards the zenith. Occasionally a rift in them allowed sunbeams to fall athwart the scarped peak of Frenchman's Cap, encir- cling with a golden halo its coronet of snow. In the glen, where the convicts worked, a dead calm prevailed, yet, on the summit of the high ranges the tops of the giant trees were agitated with advance gusts from the 

 coming storm. 

 ''Better get these scamps together, Haw- kins," spoke Lieutenant Cuthbert. "Some of them might make a break if they got the chance." 

 "They're not such fools as that, sir; but it's near muster-time, an' I'll round them up," replied the overseer, giving orders to 

 his men. 

 In a few minutes the gang were gathered on a small clearing, it being dangerous to seek shelter under the trees. Leg-ironed as they were, and guarded by seven armed soldiers, escape seemed out of the question. A few minutes after the bondmen assem- bled the summer storm burst upon them with tropical fury. Strangely enough, huge hailstones fell from the swirling clouds on the unprotected felons, and surprised their guards. Caught in the fierce wind, they were swept with pitiless fury against the exposed faces of the convicts, who fronted the storm. Even the soldiers, with their backs to it, felt strongly tempted to seek shelter. The roar of the thunder, mingled with the crash of falling trees struck by lightning, warned them of the danger of 

 seeking cover. 

 Lieutenant Cuthbert and the overseer were both noted martinets, and almost in- credible stories of their callous cruelty were told of them. They looked upon the felons as no better than brute beasts, and treated them accordingly. On the left of the cowering band stood a huge convict. Even with cropped hair and beard, and clad in the motley magpie garb, there was something superior about the man. The sensual brutal expression writ large on the faces of most of the others was absent. 

 Next him ranged a man with traces still remaining of the bluff, open countenance typical of the British sailor. 

 Lieutenant Cuthbert stood close to the first-mentioned, on whom the full force of the storm beat. The felon at length partly turned his back on the fusillade of hail, when the officer sternly ordered him to front it. Either the man did not hear him above the noise of the conflicting elements or decided not to heed him, as he remained immovable. Instantly Cuthbert raised his right hand and struck the convict a violent blow on the side of the head with his fist. Roused to sudden fury, the bondman faced round, and seizing the officer by the throat dashed him on the ground. 

 White with passion Cuthbert rose, and lifting his musket took aim at his assailant. Pulling the trigger, the firelock, wet with the downpour, only snapped. The act roused the instinct of self-preservation in the heart of the convict. Seizing the mus- ket he wrenched it from the lieutenant, and swinging it with terrible force dashed, out the officer's brains with the butt. 

 It all happened in the space of a few seconds, and before the surprised guard could raise a hand to interfere. As the officer fell Corporal Edwards shouted "Fire," and the seven muskets were in- stantly raised. Overseer Hawkins checked the expected volley by exclaiming, "Don't shoot, you d��d asses. "Twill be death 

 to us." 

 Their wits thus sharpened by the warn- ing showed them the danger of the situa- tion, and caused the trigger-fingers to relax. With empty weapons they would be at the mercy of the infuriated felons, and nothing could save them from vengeance. 

 Meanwhile the slayer of Cuthbert had not been idle. Fully realising the position, he turned and ran across the clearing to- wards the dense jungle on the right. As if actuated by a sympathetic impulse, the man next him followed, but the others, though wildly excited by the development, 

 remained. 

 As the fugitives, hampered by the leg- irons, ran slowly to the scrub, Hawkins ordered two of the guard to fire on them. One of the muskets snapped while, the 

 bullet of the other went wide of its mark. A few seconds later both runaways reached shelter. Under the circumstances, the overseer could not pursue. 

 "Fools," he muttered; "they will answer with their necks for this." 

 "Numbers 786 and 843 have taken to the bush after killing Cuthbert, you say, Haw- kins. This is serious news. We must run them down at all hazards," spoke the civil commandant when he heard the intelli- gence. "Tell Captain Gunn I want 

 him." 

 The two fugitives well knew that every effort would be made to effect their cap- ture, and they also realised the hopeless- ness of their forlorn situation. Without arms or food, and hampered with the leg- irons, it seemed impossible to escape capture for long. Yet the love of liberty was strong in them, and they decided that death would be preferable before capture. Creep- ing through the scrub, with the pelting storm sweeping around them, they made across a ridge, and descended to the gloomy depths of a glen. 

 As night fell they reached a narrow ravine, and turned to the west. "We must make for the coast, Ned," spoke the shorter of the two; "the bush would be our grave." 

 Silently acquiescing, the tall convict followed the sailor until darkness caused a halt to be made. Then they tried to free themselves from the leg-irons. For hours they worked with flint and rocks until the cross bar was fractured. At dawn the men r med the journey, until, climbing a hill, they saw the vast Southern Ocean stretching away to the mysterious pole. Both were starving, and, descending to the beach, a few shell-fish were gathered and devoured. 

 While so engaged a call from the tall man, whoso name was Edward Hare, at- tracted the attention of his comrade. The huge convict pointed to the north, and, looking round a portion of jutting cliff, the sailor saw a boat being rowed towards them. It contained pursuers from the station, and, turning, the fugitives made again for 

 the bush. 

 Wandering aimlessly about in the after- noon they reached the banks of a broad stream which emptied into the sea. They were proceeding along the bank when the keen eyes of Hare once again caught sight of the boat containing their enemies. It was entering the river, and the fugitives con- cealed themselves in the adjacent scrub 

 until it should pass by. 

 Much to their consternation, instead of pulling up-stream, the party landed almost opposite their hiding-place. The boat con- tained five soldiers under Captain Gunn, and four boatmen. Leaving two of the latter in charge of the craft, the captain started off with the remainder to search the vicinity. 

 Scarcely had he gone than Hare, with a fierce light in his eyes, turned to his com- rade and said, "We must make a venture and get that boat. There is food in it." 

 "Food," muttered the other. "Yes, let us try. There isn't any time to be lost 

 either." 

 Creeping through the scrub, the fugitives moved to within a dozen yards of the moored boat. One of the men was engaged lighting a fire on the bank of the stream, the other gathering the fuel. This fellow, while doing so, approached the spot where the convicts crouched, and, seizing the op- nortunity, Hare jumped upon and dealt him a stunning blow with a piece of wood. Without a cry the man fell, and then the two made swiftly for the second guard. Taken unawares, he could not offer success- ful resistance, as the attackers got be- tween him and the boat, where his musket lay. With a cry of alarm he fled into the scrub, while Hare and his companion un- fastened the mooring, and, getting into the boat, pushed off down-stream. 

 The sailor took the oars and pulled with the strength of desperation. Aided by the current, the craft swept swiftly down, 

 while the call for help of the guard echoed through the bush. 

 "Pull for your life, Tyson. We may yet get away," exclaimed Hare, sitting op- posite, and assisting the oarsman. 

 Captain Gunn speedily became aware of what had happened, and ordered his men to try and intercept the runaways. The rough ground and dense scrub prevented them reaching the headland in time to cut off the convicts. When they got to the huge cliffs overlooking the Ocean, the boat was nearly a quarter of a mile seaward. A dozen shots followed, but without effect, and, as Captain Gunn stood with hands shading his eyes, the little craft disap- peared from his vision in the gathering 

 mist of evening. 

 "Curse the dogs. They have outwitted us; but we must follow the coast, and have our revenge," he exclaimed, wrathfully, turning away. 

 At the same moment the escapees were congratulating themselves on their good fortune. Tho boat contained a stock of food suffient to last them for a couple of weeks. Even, more valuable, they thought, were the two muskets and the ammunition obtained. The sailor, now in his element, was boisterous in his joy, and fairly shouted in his exuberance of feeling. 

 After a drink of rum and a hearty meal, he resumed rowing, Hare taking an occa- sional spell. As night advanced, a south wind rose, and the sea caused the craft to 

 pitch rather heavily. Worn out with fatigue and loss of sleep, Hare lay in the bottom, and slumbered. Before midnight his companion, thoroughly exhausted, 

 aroused him, and took his turn of rest. 

 Two hours passed, and the motion of the boat became worse, causing Hare to put down the oars, and let the little vessel drift in the darkness. Soon a dull boom fell upon his ears, but he gave little heed to it until, gradually increasing in volume, his suspicions caused him to awake the 

 sailor. 

 Sitting up in a drowsy state; the man lis- tened with dull ears, but in a few moments the truth burst upon him. "Breakers," he muttered. "I've heard the coast is treacherous hereabouts." 

 Fully awakened, the fugitive seaman told Hare of the danger which threatened, and turned the craft away from the sound. The inky blackness prevented objects being seen, save the occasional glimpse of white, like a flitting ghost, caused by the breaking crest of a roller. 

 "I'm glad you roused me, Ned. If we got among those shoals, 'twould have been all over with us. Our best plan is to keep out. The sea is getting rough, too, but, perhaps, at dawn we may be able to run in 

 somewhere. If��" 

 As he spoke there was a fearful shock, as the boat plumped against a rock in the treacherous shoal off Point Hibbs. The next moment a giant roller caught it broad- side on, and dashed the frail vessel on the jutting basalt, overturning it, and plunging the men into the swirling surf. 

 As Hare rose he heard a faint "Good- bye" called to him from the darkness, and then he commenced a grim battle for life. Though a splendid swimmer it availed him little in such a place. With irresistible force the waves dashed him about like a cork, and several times he was almost knocked senseless against the rocks. For nearly an hour the struggle continued in the awful darkness until a huge roller caught him up, and flung the despairing man against a cliff. Grasping wildly at the face, he caught a sharp ledge, and held, to it against the un- dertow. As the force of the roller re- ceded he managed to pull himself on to the ledge, and clung there, waiting for day- light. 

 Occasionally the water broke over, and nearly was him him off, but he managed to resist the might of the sea. Less than half an hour after he had thus been providen- tially saved he was gazing on the dark waste of troubled waters, when a wave broke in phosphorescent spray against the cliff. The ghostly light revealed to him for an instant a white face almost within 

 a yard of him. Grasping wildly out, he, caught an arm, and, exerting his prodigious strength, pulled on to the ledge the body of his late comrade. With a faint hope that life might still linger he gripped the arm, and held his mate from the sea until the welcome light of dawn began to break. 

 Then Hare saw he was within a few feet from the summit of the cliff, and noticed with intense joy signs of returning life in his mate Tyson. As the sun rose the rescued man recovered his senses, and the two got on the top of the diff, where the genial warmth speedily restored them. 

 Their position was now forlorn enough, but still, buoyed up with hope, they decided to skirt the coast southwards, and watch for any passing whaling vessel. Towards afternoon they made for a high range some three miles inland, in the hope of securing rock wallaby for food. While doing so Hare stepped on a treacherous roof of creeping vegetation, and dropped through a distance of nearly 30ft. into the ravine it covered, a broken leg resulting. 

 With infinite labour Tyson managed to get his stricken companion out of the gorge to a cliff on the side of the range. Laying him on a bed of leaves, the sailor erected a rough breakwind, and in a clumsy way set the broken limb. This last misfortune overwhelmed them both, and death ap- peared inevitable. For a week Tyson ministered to his companion. With the aid of a flint and steel found in the boat, and secured by Hare, a small fire was kept, and wallaby flesh roasted. This afforded a precarious food supply. 

 It was not long ere an uncontrollable de- sire seized upon Tyson to press on. The spirit of comradeship and gratitude to the man who had saved his life urged him to stay and not forsake the injured convict. In his opinion Hare was doomed to perish, and why sacrifice himself. From the posi- tion of the camp on the range lay a fine view of the ocean. With wistful eyes both fugitives looked upon it. Far away in peaceful Devonshire Hare thought of the 

 home he had been torn from, and the loved 

 ones he would never see again. The sight of the ocean raised in the sailor's heart a great longing for its liberty and free life. 

 On the seventh night after the accident Tyson sat moodily gazing into the embers of the fire. His companion lay silent, ap- parently asleep, and tumultuous thoughts surged through the mind of the seaman. He must save himself if possible. Of what avail was it to remain with Hare? There was nothing he could do to aid him. Both would die unless he took a sensible view, 

 and looked to himself. 

 As he mused, half unconscious of his sur- roundings, the sailor muttered his thoughts in an audible tone. A wild exclamation from behind caused him to turn in startled astonishment. Hare, half-raised on his left elbow, regarded him with eyes which 

 seemed to burn. 

 "So you would leave me here to die like a dog, Tom, that is your gratitude, is it?" 

 he hissed. 

 "Don't be a fool, Ned. You have had a nightmare, surely. I have no��" 

 "I heard your words, Tyson�everything you said, but by the God above us if you leave me a judgment will fall upon you. Living or dead I'll have vengeance. If the 

 spirit can walk, you will never know rest this side of the grave, or the other either. By all that's holy, I swear it," almost shouted Hare, in a tone of concentrated 

 hate. 

 Overcome with the force of his passion he tried to rise, but Tyson firmly held him down, and tried to soothe him with kindly words. Next davy a barrier seemed to have risen between them, but in every possible way the sailor showed attention to Hare. Three days passed, and then the climax came. As the wounded man slept Tyson placed all the available food and water in the camp beside him, and then, with a lingering look of agonised regret, turned 

 away, and plunged into the bush. 

 It was almost evening when he forsook the helpless man in that awful solitude, and with a brain almost crazed with re- morse and the conflicting desire of escape he stumbled blindly on. Night wrapped the wild district in its sable mantle, and then the full moon rose over the moun- tains. Yet the dense darkness was prefer- able to the ghostly moonlight, which three weird shadows around. 

 For hours he struggled on, and at last emerged on a headland which overlooked the sea. It was crowned with groves of sheoak�those �olian harps of the Aus- tralian bush�and as the wind whistled through the long pendulous leaves a hun- dred voices seemed to mock him. Drop- ping at the foot of a tree, he tried to sleep, but soothing slumber would not come to his exhausted body. The curse of his for- saken comrade already at appeared to affect him. He was haunted. Above the strange sounds of the night accusing voices mocked him and upbraided his treachery. In vain the miserable man tried to reason. His sufferings and the solitude had weakened his mind. The advent of another day gave a brief stimulus to his courage, but it soon vanished. The solitude overpowered him, and soon after midday he determined to regain the camp. 

 The gloom of evening was deepening as he reached the range, and turned to the cliff where the camp had been pitched. With reassuring words on his lips, he walked quickly to the place and looked into the rude structure where he had left 

 Hare. 

 He was not there, the breakwind being 

 empty. 

 Overwhelmed at this unexpected develop- ment, Tyson remained rigid as a statue, gazing into the vacant place. Then he roused and began to shout the name of his lost comrade. Like one demented, he ran about the range calling at the top of his voice on Hare. Only echoes from the ad- 

 jacent cliffs and rocks responded. For an hour or more he thus acted, until the sound of his voice died to a whisper. Then nature came to his rescue, and he sunk to the earth in swoon of exhaustion. 

 A fortnight later the crew of the whaling ship Seahorse were engaged "trying out" 

 at the Port Davey works, on the south- west const of Van Dieman's Land. Con- tinuously day and night the labour was car- ried on, huge fires being lighted on the beach to melt the blubber. About 10 o'clock on the night of the 30th January two negro seamen were carrying a tub of blubber to the fire, when with a simul- taneous exclamation of surprise they dropped it and rushed across to the pic- turesque group of seamen, representing al- most every nationality, who were engaged 

 at the fire. 

 "Gor Amighty"! Just look!" one of the blacks cried. 

 From out of the scrub which fringed the beach a wild-looking, half-human figure had emerged, a few tattered rags still clinging to his form. With the voracity of a famished wolf he seized a piece of raw blubber and began to greedily devour it. Recovering from their surprise, several of the men approached, headed by Captain Mayne. "Some poor devil of a convict, I suppose," muttered tho skipper, whose sympathy was notoriously with such run- 

 aways. 

 A few moments conversation convinced him that his opinion was correct, and soon "Number 843", otherwise Thomas Tyson, was comfortably berthed on board the Sea- horse. Three days later the whaler left Port Dave, and headed for the north. On the deck stood a gaunt-faced, sad-eyed man, surrounded by a group of wondering sailors, to whom he narrated a weird story that was half truth and half fiction. 

 On Christmas Eve, 1832, the ship Dela- ware arrived in Sydney Harbour from Liverpool, having on board nearly two hun- dred colonists, who intended settling in the new land of Australia. Botany Bay and its convict associations were being super- seded, and sturdy men and women were laying the foundation under the Southern 

 Cross of a Greater Britain. 

 Amongst the passengers were two ladies 

 �mother and daughter�named Hyde, the latter being a charming girl of about 20. They were voyaging to join the husband and father, who had some years previously sought fortune in New South Wales, and found it. The first mate of the Delaware, 

 one Thomas Mayne, had fallen violently in love with Miss Hyde. The sailor, though some dozen years older than the object of his affections, was by no means an undesir- able match, and so Mrs. Hyde realised. There was something in his grave manner which impressed her favourably, and it must be said the daughter did not turn a deaf ear to his addresses. Before the ship reached Port Jackson the two were en- gaged. 

 By arrangement with the captain, Mayne managed to get his discharge at Sydney. He had nearly �600 of his own, and meant 

 to settle in the new land. His first task was to find Hyde, who did not meet the ship at port. Mrs. Hyde explained this by saying she had not acquainted her hus- band with the name of the vessel she would sail by, and, doubtless, he would await a letter. 

 He had written her last from Illawarra, where he owned a saw-mill in the cedar forest. To there it would be necessary for Mayne to go, and hunt him up. In those days postal arrangements were pri- 

 mitive, and letters often miscarried. Mayne, indeed, was overjoyed at the pro- spect of carrying good news to his pro- spective father-in-law, and immediately be- fore the end of the month set out for Illa- 

 warra. 

 The journey was a trying one. The 

 blazing sun had dried up vegetation, and bush fires raged around. Through miles of blackened country he travelled until the picturesque and beautiful Illawarra moun- 

 tains were reached. In the glens and valleys amongst them the stately cedar 

 grew, and a resident told him that Hyde would be found in a certain locality. Taking a guide Mayne plunged into the forest, and traversed the rugged country to the district indicated. Until then he 

 had no idea what a cedar forest in its primitive state was like. The dense foliage of the trees in places shut out the sun s rays, and for miles he walked in a ghostly twilight, stumbling over half decayed logs and heaps of dank vegetation. 

 Several sawmills were met, but at none of them was Hyde found. His location lay, so a woodman told him, across a deep ravine, which he pointed out. Late in the afternoon of the 3rd January, 1833, this was crossed, and Mayne seated himself on a log, while the guide made a fire to boil some water for tea. As he sat the sound of chopping reached his ears, and anxious to find the object of his journey, he went towards the place. Some three hundred yards away he reached a clearing where a huge cedar tree had been recently felled. Sitting on the stump, with his back to him, was a man, and Mayne approached. 

 "Can you tell me where to find Edward Hyde?" he asked, as he neared the wood- 

 man. 

 With a start as though an electric shock had been felt, the stranger jumped to his feet, and faced the newcomer. A strange light shot from his eyes as he looked. For a few moments the sawyer hesitated, and then, with a suppressed cry of passionate fury, he leaped on Mayne, hissing as he 

 did so. 

 "Ah, traitor and coward, my vengeance 

 has come at last." 

 Taken unaware, Mayne was borne down before the fury of the onset, and then re- covering himself a fearful struggle com- menced. Thinking for a moment, he had to deal with a mailman, he shouted to his guide for help, who came hurrying up, but before he reached the spot the combat had ended. Mayne�or rather Tyson�recog- 

 nised his assailant. 

 "For God's sake, Hare," he gasped, half- strangled as he was, "let me explain. I come from your wife and daughter." 

 Gradually the fearful grip of the sawyer relaxed, and the appearance of the guide in- 

 duced him to listen. 

 "From my wife and daughter," he re- peated. "Go away, man. We have a score to settle, and you must not interfere," he added to the guide. 

 "Yes, leave us for a few minutes, Joe. You would be none the wiser if you lis- tened," spoke Mayne, alias Tyson. 

 In a few minutes the escapee from Mac- quarie Harbour penal station told his strangely-found companion in misfortune what the reader already knows. When he spoke of the sudden remorse which seized him, of his return to the breakwind, and his wild agony at finding it tenantless, with the vain quest, the hard lines on the face of Edward Hare softened. 

 "As God will judge me, I meant to die with you, Ned, if I could not save you, only a mad, uncontrollable impulse caused me to leave the camp." 

 Hare remained silent for a full minute 

 Then he said, "Let us forget the past, and its terrible memories. Tell me of the pre- sent, and what brings you here. You spoke of my wife and daughter. What do you 

 know of them ?" 

 Tyson told him everything, even to his engagement with Amy, and to his surprise Hare did not offer objection, though he did not at once acquiesce. " Come to my camp and have a rest. I'll start back in the morning," he said. 

 During the evening he told Tyson, who, of course, was quite unaware of his move- ments how he had got away from solitude and death. When, next morning, it be- came clear to him that Tyson had gone, the energy of despair seized him. Crippled though he was, Hare managed to crawl through the bush to a ridge overlooking the ocean. There he made a fire, and next morning, as fate willed it, the crew of a passing whaler that had put in for fresh water saw it and found him. For four years he remained on the vessel, and at length reached Sydney. With two other members of the crew he left, and began cedar-getting at Illawarra, and, on the first possible occasion, managed to acquaint his wife with the fact. Caution was extremely necessary, and thus time rolled on before he thought it safe for wife and daughter to join him. 

 That was the gist of the narrative, and Tyson's story was just as prosaic. Captain Mayne, of the Seahorse, befriended him, and, through his influence and good offices, he managed to ultimately get a berth as third mate on the Delaware, where he rose to first officer. 

 The ex-convicts did not long remain in the cedar forests. Tyson and Amy Hyde were married, and the two families settled in one of the agricultural districts, where they lived in peace and amity.
