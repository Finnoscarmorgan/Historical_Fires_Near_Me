Chapter 2. 

 Mr. Barill was naturally choleric and bad tempered. He was on the camp cursing everything� the men, the cattle, the country, the weather, the bush fire, even himself. As Jack and Toby had arrived from the direction of the fire he flew at them like a tiger. The reader whose sensibilities are not ofthe two refined type may try to imagine the language used ; the gentle reader I hope will not try. 

 Toby, when the storm of words ceased, soon threw Mr. Barill on the wrong scent. 'So there's some d ? fossickers on my run, is there? No wonder the cattle's wild and the grass on fire. Suppose these are the fellows tfiat came in to the station the other week for beef, and gave cheek because I wanted to give them some of the old dried stuff. They reckoned they could get it better and cheaper from Lawn Valley� con- found 'em ! Here ! you boys ! Take the whole mob to the yards. Hunt, you and Toby come with me.' The three rode back in Hunt and Toby's tracks. The bush fire had got a big hold, and nothing could be done. 'Show me track longa diggings, Toby,' said Barill. Hunt and Toby daren't say a word, but no doubt the thoughts of both were similar. The old track to the diggings was picked up. Sure enough it looked as if Tobys surmise was true. A traveller with two horses had hut recently gone along. No doubt he had set the grass on fire. The little camp of fossickers was soon reached. Two horses were grazing tfear, riding-saudle ? and pack-saddle lay under a bough dining shed, adjoining a tent. Two or three diggers were standing round a man who appeared to be a new comer. Say, you men, which of you owns these horses?' The voice was imperious, the manner dis dainful. The new comer's back was towards the squatter, but with a quick wheel he con fronted the speaker. 'They're mine, Mister Barill. What have you to say about them ?' 'Ah, it's you Conroy, is it? WelL I haven't much to say about your horses, probably you've got them on the square,' and Barill's lips curled sneeringly as he spoke,' but I have something to say about yourself. What the devil do you ' Yuur grass ?' and the mocking laugh that issued from Oonroy'slips sent the uncontroll able black blood surging and boiling through the squatter's veins. 'Yes! my grass! Conroy, this is my country. You infernal agitator, when are you not inflaming men's minds against those who feed them and against law and order, your selfish, envious, turbulent nature compels you to set up as a destroyer. What good will it do you to burn grass that should go to fill the empty stomachs of cattle ? Perhaps you knew I had lately bought theplace, and you wanted to pay off old scores in this mean cowardly way.' .1 owe you no grudge, Barill,' replied Oonroy, whose eyes flashed, and over whose mobile face various shades were passing� now anger, now restraint, passion, dignity, pity, all chased each other in rapid succession over Conroy'8 striking and expressive features. 'It is year's ago since I learned that 'Man is the child of habit and the creature of circum stances,' but learning and even believing a truth unfortunately does not enable human nature to live up to it, and plant in our hearts that charity that makes us hesitate to throw the first stone � nevertheless, Barill, I tell you / owe you no grudge.1 We are both the children of habit and of circumstances. Some of your temperament and of your mental qualities you probably owe to your ancestors acquisition in spite of Weismann's new theory, but whether you and I were rough hewed by many unknown projenitors in the misty generations long gone by this is at least cer tain�we are more the creatures of the present life than the past. Our environment from the cradle to the grave is the principal motive power, is the principal cause of the effect. Thestruggle for existence is a perpetual attempt to burst our environment, and may he the original cause of all past progress.' Conroy'8 face altered as if an overpower ing remembrance had suddenly come to him � He changed his voice, and in a raised and angry tone ho said � 'But this iis only agitator's talk, Mr. Barill. JuBt now you charged me with burn ing grass, and insinuated that I was trying to pay off old scores in a mean and cowardly way.' 

 'Listen ! I can talk a smattering of SociaUsm, and evolution, and phUosophy when the mood suits me, Now, the devil� the result sf say environment principally, but aome of it no doubt due to my prehistoric ancestors having transmitted to me what Tennyson calk the 'inobd-of tiger or of *pe'fHnow, I say, the devil impelB me to say something, and it js this� You lie both In your direct accusation and insinuation, and I T�^l�nge -^ou to either get off your hoi^imd prove y^ ijiTorda, or apolo gise to one who is wiUwjg *o show that he is not a coward at any rate. These men will see fair play. You*re� heavier man than I, but no matter, right is on my side.' Without a wond save---** Hold my horse, Toby!' Barill stepped lightly down. His was a peculiar temperament, ordinarily hasty and choleric, yet in danger he grew calm and nonchalant. 'Your talk's not half bad, Gonroy, I've learned tt- think better of you during the last five minutes than ever I did during the strike out West last year. Perhaps you've learned something since then. To tell you the truth Fd sooner have an argument with you than a fight, particularly as you seemed to admit that the struggle for existence was probably the cause of our progress, such as it is� and mind you, Conroy, our civilisation is a great one� the greatest that ever existed, in spite ofthe intense culture and brain power of the ancient Greek, and in spite of the fact that Gladstone has said that the men of the sixteenth century were greater than the men of to-day.' 'No civilisation is great, cannot be great,' respondedOonroy, 'wnereprogressand poverty go on side by side. Suppose that I admit that the struggle for existence has been die original cause of progress. With the struggle for exis tence came the struggle for the life of others ' � A smile crept over the squatter's lips. Conroy saw it, and the humour of his last words taken in conjunction with the situation caused him to smile too. In the meantime Jack Hunt had been fidgeting about in his saddle, his tongue ready at any moment to blab out something in order to prevent a serious quarrel. Toby tookjtlungs more philosophically, and regarded the 'yabber' as the usual and necessary pre liminary to a fight. The more words before the battle the more it seemed in accordance with aboriginal ideas on the etiquette of single combat. The whole scene was as incongruous as it could possibly be. Btebard HI. making love Hfco Lady Anne whose husband he had killed, and in the pre sence of !the corpse of murdered Henry is a reality hard to imagine, and not less difficult is it to conceive of two individuals like Barill, the squatter, and Conroy, the shearer, dis cussing sociological problems, whilst at the same moment they were preparing to spring at each other's throats. Conroy's smile died away almost as fast as it came. His sense of humour was evidently not his strongest point. Labour and sociological problems had perhaps been studied tod much, and a naturally serious temperament had been hardened and darkened by dwelling too oon stantly on the shadowy part of life. Men and women of refined and acute sensibilities, of great perceptive powers, possessing sympathy and imagination, over-estimate the sufferings of the poor. It is, perhaps, well they should. It is better to go to the extreme in that direction than the other. For some thrifty and wealthy people to only imagine the possibility of having to live from hand to mouth, their earnings spent as soon as obtained, nay, in hundreds of thousands of cases before they are obtained, would be a torture; .yet we know that the poir, having been accustomed to this condition of things from their childhood, dont fret and worry half so much over it as plenty of rich or moderately well-circumstanced people do from envy of their neighbours, or from a drop in the price of shares, or from some social agony. The' little urchin playing in the gutter with his tatters and patches and his crust of bread and treacle, is happier than the rioh man's child surrounded by every luxury but with liberties curtailed. But when the crust of bread and treacle is missing� ah ! what then ? It is not often missing in * sunny Queensland, thank God 3 But m other lands and harsher climes the little children of the poor do suffer. They pine away, and die in thousands of cases, from lack of that nursing the poor mother cannot always give, for lack of that nourishment that only people with means can afford. The absence of fresh air and sunshine, the lack of infant's foods when the wretched broken-down mother's milk begins to faiL send thousands of babes every year into their little graves. And it was thoughts such as these, only more intense, more turbulent, less balanced, that made Oonroy a labour reformer and leader. During the strike times, Mr. BarilL then the ownerof a sheep station, had proved his pluck an6T3etermination amidst crowds of angry men. He was athletic and vigorous, and few men cared to face him single handed. He was usually reckoned as being mean in pecuniary matters. He was niggardly in small things, as was shown by bis restriction of the black boy's tobacco ; hence he had amongst the many an unenviable reputation for traits of character that the populace despise. His well-known pluck would have been reckoned a redeeming feature had it not been associated with a blustering manner. But here and there were ToundTTren to say a good word for him, and bank managers might have thrown some light on certain cheques drawn for charitable purposes. When Conroy's smile vanished and 'the mood of tiger' again appeared Barill's blood also rose, though he could not help admiring the plucky shearer. ' Come on, Conroy ! We'll soon see who is best man.' ' YeB, from a wild beast's point of view ; but even that is something. I'm ready. Now!' The two men put up their hands, and were measuring each other with flashing eyes, when Jack Hunt decided it was time to interferev ' Stop, boss, stop ! It was me that set the grass on fire. This man is innocent.' Barill's arms dropped to his sides ; his chest heaved convulsively j his eyes softened ; he made an effort, so it seemed, to direct his anger on Hunt, but the attempt failed. Hunt's manliness in confessing took the fire out of 

 his heart, #o 'Swtfi a nervous tmtching of hk lipa iwiiti i la WHWiro -$f pain shooting aoross his features, Barill extended his hand to Conroy. *Wm ha*� w�& ; t3on�^1~Tt1ve you beet ; I apologise. Gome and see me at the station. Thei� are no unions amongst the cattle men or fossickers, unlea8'~*nd here the squatter gave a sharp but haU humorous glance around � 'unless your ounning tongue has been Already at work in this district. We meet on neutral ground, Oonroy, jao come to the station and spend your Ohrlstnias. I want to have a talk with you on WeisnuinniBm. I can't make up my mind whether Herbert Spencer has the best of the argument or not. Then I think I can prove from your own admission that pro gress is owing to the struggle for existence that the poor we must always have with us.' Conroy stood in perplexed thought. He had been in the habit of receiving more kicks than ha'pence from the squatters, and Barill's manly apology and hospitable invitation to his home unnerved him for the moment. ? 'There is no bribery and corruption meant, Conroy. I am now out of the fight, and have no unions to quarrel with here. Make up your mind.' Smilingly, he continued, in the words of the Salvation Army hymn, ' Will you come ? Will you come?' - ' Conroy's hand went out, and Capital --and Labour met in a hearty and loving grip. 'Yes, I will come, Mr. Barill ' � there was no scornful emphasis on the Air. now. 'Perhaps we both stand in need of conversion ; perhaps we can both learn something from the other. You will be able to show the almost insuperable obstacles in the path of Socialism, or even in the path of 'equal opportunities for all j' I will be able, I trust, to demonstrate from Kidd and Brummond, from 'Social Evolution' and 'The Ascent of Man,' that the progress of Society is in the main altruistic ; that whilst the evolution of man's body has reached its fullest development, the mind and the ethical principles attached to it may be only in then- dawjn, and only slowly taking shape from our possibly still clumsy attempts at adjustment; that, therefore, the law clearly written above every other law, above even the struggle for Existence, is the struggle for the Life of Others. Commencing in Motherhood it will culminate fin Love� love for all� the love that Christ pleached when on earth. This is the Further Evolution, the page of history that lies before us, the dosing act of the drama of man.' In Conroy's eyes shone the light of inspira tion and enthusiasm. Mr. Barill was affected momentarily, but he shook the magnetic influence off � ' Just now we had our hands at each other's throats, Conroy. In a few moments you and I were transformed int) the savages and apes from whence we have sprang. What is the worth of the Moral Progress you speak of if we have such a poor result to show ? Unless you can fit our minds into different bodies and transform human nature, all will be in vain� but there, Oonroy, never mind replying. You shall have the last word at the station. Turning to the few miners who all this time had been interested observers and listeners, the owner of Greenlands said, ' And you men come over too. There's plenty of room. Ill open my heart this Christmas if I never did it before/' Laughingly he went on � '111 practice for once a little of the 'SociaUsm in Our Time' business that your Labour papersnpreach in season and out of season. By-the-by, how many men are there in your camp?' ' About a dozen,' one of the men replied. ' Well, tell them all to come, and there'll be a fifty of beef for each of you when you leave.' Mounting his horse, and with a wave of his hand for a farewell, Mr. Barill rode away followed by Jack and Toby. For the present the play is done, and the curtain must drop. The writer cannot look into the future. Some other day Conroy and Barill may again appear to point a moral and adorn a tale. It may interest the reader to know, however, that on the ride home Barill, by dint of skilfully cross-questioning Jack and Toby, managed to elicit the truth about the bush fire. 'You're white, Jack, anyhow !' was all the squatter said. , George Jackson.
