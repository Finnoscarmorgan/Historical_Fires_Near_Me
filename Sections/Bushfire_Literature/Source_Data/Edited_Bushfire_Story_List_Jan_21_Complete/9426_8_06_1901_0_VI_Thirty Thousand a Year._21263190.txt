 THE STORY OF A SELECTION. 

 CHAPTER VI.-Thirty Thousand a Year. 

 By ETHEL TURNER, Author of "The Story of a Baby," "Seven Little Australians," &c. 

 Ah! for a man to arise in me, That the man I am may cease to be. " I should think we might get the bag of corn now, eh, Bart?" Cameron wiped his 

 brow and stepped to survey the patch of ground that looked so smooth. Bart looked at it critically. " I think we'd better give it another turn, dad," he said, and hitchaed the string-mended harness a little more securely to the jaded horse; " it's such a lunatic plough�it misses twice for every time it hits." Cameron looked at the wide space of ground to be gone over yet again. " I'm very anxious to get the seed in," he said. " You see we're a month late as it is, and it will be a big saving in feed when we have it to cut." "Yes, but it is no good unless the ground is ready," Bart said; "we have no manure or anything like the ' Journal ' says. We'd better give it an extra turn." " You're quite right�quite right, my boy," Cameron, said, and led big horse on again, up and down, up and down the furrows. " I don't like such a lot of stumps being left in," Bart said the seventh time in anhour   that the plough had gnashed on one. " In the 'Journal ' there's a picture of a stump eradi- cator�a grand little machine�we'll have to save up and get it, dad." "Ay, ay," said the father. "Still I don't think the stumps will interfere very much. The corn can easily come up between them." " It would be easier ploughing," sighed Bart, following the horse about in a waved line. " You're tired out, lad; knock off for a spell," Cameron said. " I keep forgetting how young you are. We have been working here since 8�five hours." But Bart would work till he dropped rather than leave off a minute before bis father; he took a long drink at the oatmeal water Miss Browne had made, and went on, stooping, picking out the stones, digging spots the un- faithful plough had left untouched, following the horse while his father dug. Cameron was thin as a rail. Ever since they had come here he had worked like a man possessed, for he spectacle that came to haunt his nights was ohis children in actual need of   bread. He had left debts behind him in the township, a hundred pounds worth of them; there was a hundred and fifty yet to pay on the selection, and the patching up of the house, tough as it had been, had taken money. There was seed to buy, there were tools to mend or replace, interest to pay on the money he had borrowed on the place�a thousand other things. And not one word of all the changes did the letters carry across the secret seas. "There is no need to worry Mama un- necessarily," Cameron said to the children. " When we have made a great success of the place and paid everything off then we will tell her." Across the acres came the insistent sound of the dinner bell. "I don't think I'll stop," Cameron said, " I'm not hungry. Off you go, Bart, and don't come back for an hour." But Bart was learning the art of managing his father. "The poor old nag wants a rest," he said; " we must take her up and give her a drink and same oats. And I'd come in to dinner, dad, if I were you; Hermie will be disappointed if you don't." So they went up to the little patchwork house together. It was not to a very tempting repast the bell had summoned them. Hermie, no longer able to order macaroons and whitebait, and tinned oysters to make delicacies with, had, childlike, lost interest in the culinary department of the house. And Miss Browne was no artist; to her a leg of mutton represented nothing but a leg of mutton, and fricassees and such tempt- ing departures seemed but tales in the cookery book never to be put to practical use. To-day there were chops�fried. Years, back when Lizzie came fresh from the "State" to Mrs. Cameron's tutelage she had been instantly instructed into the fine art of grilling. But   now that there was no one to insist upon these delicate distinctions, and the frying pan was so much easier labour, Cameron was slowly for- getting the taste of grilled meat. There were potatoes too; the family took it for granted that these were necessarily nasty things, either watery or burnt. Bread and jam�no longer silverpan conserve, but cheap raspberry, in which the chief element was tomato�finished the pleasing repast. Miss Browne sat at the head of the table, ex- hausted and dishevelled, for she had swept the room and sewn on four buttons and dressed Floss, and set the table. Cameron, before removing to the selection, had dismissed her again, gently enough; he knew it would be impossible to continue to pay her ten shillings a week for being a nuisance to them. And again she bad wept and wrung her hands and entreated to remain; the tears streaming down her cheeks, she told him the time she had been in his family was the happiest in her life. She would not dream of taking money now, she said, but she implored him to let her work for her home. So here she was still at the head of the table, faithfully apportioning the dish of chops and keeping the smallest and worst-cooked one quietly for herself, and pouring out tea, which all the family drank with each and every meal, so slowly and confusedly that her own was always cold before she touched it. " Not a chop ?" she said to Cameron. " Oh, but you really must. Think of the severe physical labour you are continually doing. Just a small one? You touched no meat yesterday nor the day before." She looked on the verge of tears. "Don't trouble�l don't care for any." Cameron said. "I'll have some�some�" his eyes wandered round the table in search of 

 something nicer than the potatoes�"some     bread and butter." But Lizzie's prentice hand at bread! And store butter three weeks old ! He reached himself "Pendennis," and helped by the pleasant gossiping of the Major managed to swallow a few mouthfuls. All through the meal Miss Browne lamented over his appetite, but he heeded her voice just as much as he did the flies that bussed round his teacup�both were integral parts of life and to be endured. "May I put you a chop aside and warm it up for your tea?" she persisted anxiously. He put his finger on the place in the book and looked up for one second. " I am going to try vegetarianism," he said. "I have come to the conclusion that meat does not agree with me." And it did not. Every second Saturday now with bis own hands he was obliged to kill a sheep for the sake of his family; he found a man would charge ten shillings each time to come the distance. The physical nausea from the task was such that from the time he first took the knife into his shuddering hand to the day they buried him no morsel of animal food passed bis lips. The children were still�a month after they had come�full of magnificent enthusiasms. Hermie and Miss Browne were going to restore the fallen fortunes of the family by raising   poultry. Hermie worked intoxicating sums on paper, and even Miss Browne, distrustful of the child's arithmetic on checking the figures could find so little wrong that she began to be a-tremble with delight at the prospect herself. Bart himself, the only one of the family touched with caution, found they had left suf- ficient margin for losses, and assented that a   fortune might assuredly be made. For who could dispute the fact that the grocer charged from one to two shillings a dozen for his eggs, according to season ? Let them reckon on a basis of one shilling. And   Small, the butcher, charged three and sixpence to four and sixpence a pair for table fowls. Let them be very safe and say two and six pence. They were starting with the twelve fowls the Dunks had left on the estate. Now if one hen in one year brought up three clutches of chickens, how many would that make? Hermie with shining eyes cried thirty-nine, but Bart, who had seen mortality among chickens, refused to put down more than twenty. " Very well," said Hermie, "count twenty if you like, only I know it will be thirty-nine, I shall be so careful of them. Twelve hens with twenty chickens each, that will be�that will be�what are twelve twenties, Miss Browne." "Two hundred and forty," replied the lady, amazed herself that it could be so much� " two hundred and forty ! Why, I have never seen so many together in my life." Bart wrote down the figures two hundred and forty. "Fowls grow up in six months," Hermie said. "Lizzie says so, and her mother used to keep fowls. The 'Journal ' says�l read it this morning�that fowls generally lay 200 eggs a year. "Say 150," Bart said. "Very well," said Hermie. "Please, Miss Browne, what are two hundred and forty times one hundred and fifty ?" "My dear," gasped Miss Browne, " I�l really need a pencil for that."     Bart offered his stump, and Miss Browne was five minutes working the sum, so sure was she she must have made an astounding mistake somewhere. "It�it certainly comes to 36,000," she said at last.   " Would you please multiply it by a shilling a dozen and say what it comes to," was Hermie's further request. Miss Browne again took a surprising time to do the simple sum. " A hundred and fifty pounds," she said. "That is for the first year," Hermie said; " but now would you please work it out on this big piece of paper and see what we should get the second year. Two hundred and forty fowls " "And the twelve you began with too," said Roly. Hermie was quite willing to be cautious. " We won't count them, we'll allow for them dying too," she said. "Two hundred and forty fowls with say twenty chickens each in the year. What's that?" Miss Browne's pencil worked� "Four thousand eight hundred," she said. " And they lay 150 eggs a year." Miss Browne looked quite shaken at the result her arithmetic produced. " 720,000 eggs ! �30,000 !" The excitement made her work out the re- sults of the third year, and she was weeping when the sum came out��60,000. She was weeping for her gray, spoiled life. Exquisite dresses, travel, health, even marriage, and little children of her own, would have been all possible had she worke d these sums years and years ago and set to work with twelve fowls. Bart still had misgivings. " More might   die than that," he said. Hermie was quite pale with the excitement. " We have counted that half that come out die," she said, "and Lizzie says her mother always reared ten out of every thirteen. We have only counted six. But count three if you like, still that is thirty thousand pounds. And we have not counted selling any." Even Bart saw the moderation that only counted three chickens to each hatching, and his doubts died away. Visions of all this wealth intoxicated the children; they tore their father from his book; Hermie told him, with eyes ashine with tears and little heaving breast, that he was never to do any more of that dreadful ploughing, that in three years they would be making thirty thousand a year at least by no harder work than just feeding the fowls and packing up eggs. He smiled at them very gently�he could not bear to damp their ardour. In very truth he could not exactly find out why these figures should not be as they seemed. "Of coarse you would have a huge feed bill and want a big run of land," he said. Bart gave a comprehensive sweep of his young arm towards the scrubby bush land that 

 lay around them. "As much as we like for a shilling an acre a year," he said. But the feed bill ?" " Five thousand a year would buy enough at all events, and still we'd have twenty-five thousand left," Hermie said jubilantly. "You will give up ploughing, won't you, Daddie?" Cameron temporised and said he would just do a little while the chickens grew. That night a violent wind came up with drenching rain. Cameron lay listening to it, wondering what skies were over the head of his beloved whom the seas held from him. Then he heard doors opening and shutting, whispered words, and finally a series of very angry cackles. He threw on some clothes and went to find out the meaning. In the living room an oil lamp was flaring in the draught; a Plymouth Rock was roosting on the piano top, a white Leghorn was regarding the sofa suspiciously. On the floor sat Hermie, rubbing a wrathful fowl dry with a Turkish bath towel, and presently in staggered Bartie and Miss Browne, the former with five fowls by the legs, the latter nervously holding one at arm's length. Cameron fell into a convulsion of silent laughter, so earnest were the children, so absorbed. And Miss Browne�poor Miss Browne!�how ludicrous she looked with her scanty hair flying ragged round her shoulders, her figure clad in an ancient mackintosh, her. mouth frightened, her eyes heroic with the endeavour not to let go of the fowl which twisted itself madly to peck at her trembling hand.   "I don't know what you are laughing for, Papa," Hermie said, a trifle offended, " the fowl house leaks dreadfully." " But it has rained half-a-dozen nights since we came; you never brought the things in here before, my child!" he urged. Hermie received Miss Browne's contribution on her knee and fell to drying its dejected feathers. " We didn't know before that each of them was worth two thousand five hundred pounds," she said. " Please, Papa, will you hold Bar- tie's fowls so that he can light the fire. We are going to'give them something hot to   drink." 

 CHAPTER. Vll �Come Home ! Come Home ! " Oh that 'twere possible, After long grief and pain, To find the arms of my true love Around me once again." Fire year dragged on. Sometimes word came that the travellers were at last coming home, and Cameron's heart grew warm, only to grow cold again as he realised he dare not let them come to this. Then, while the agony of dread still was crushing him, the next mail would bring the bitter relief that the time was not yet�the agent or the mosic masters or some one else had found another year was necessary, or the great career would be spoiled. Not one word all this time of the Selection, else had the "career" been in instant danger of the rain predicted, for the Mother would have journeyed at the greatest possible number of knots an hour back to them.. Her Dreamer of Dreams depending on a Selection, her children depending on her Dreamer, become his own master ! Yet heaven knew the man had had his lesson, and toiled now marvellously, piteously. Five years and not one idle day. Five years' bewildered straggling with unknown enemies� drought, hurricanes of wind, bush fires, devas- tating rains, a soil that the farmer born and bred could hardly have made pay. Never a complaining word. Hermie, growing to woman- hood, broke her heart over his life at times. There was even a day when she fell down on her knees at a chair and covered paper wildly with a pen that commanded her mother to come home. Cameron, working obstinately on one fright- ful day, the thermometer 117, had a " touch of the sun," and even after the doctor had left him quietened, his head in cool clothe, his temperature falling, he still moaned for his wife, cried to her like a child, stretched out his arms, raved, besought her to hold his hand. It was then that Hermie broke her promise� down on her knees, just hidden by the bed curtain, writing wildly with the pen she had brought for the doctor to write his prescription. "By the next boat," she wrote," if you wait for the one after it will be wicked of you. How ran you stay like this! Challis ! Challis !� all our lives spoiled for her to have a chance. We have no chance�Father's life is worse than any dog's. Cballis�l think I hate Challis. Going along quietly and happily, are we ? Miss Macintosh taking your place ? We are starving�worse than starving, the food we have to eat is worse than none at all. He needs delicate things, ice and invalid dishes, properly cooked. I have just been to the safe to look what I could get, and the mutton has gone bad�it goes bad nearly every day in summer here; there is no milk, for the cows have no feed, there is some nasty mouldy bread and bad butter and golden syrup with flies in it, and sugar alive with ants. You ! You and Challis are eating the best things that can be bought with money. I hate Cballis. The Doctor says we are to keep his head cool with water and to stand vessels full of water about the room to cool the air. The well is nearly dry, the sun has turned the tank water bad, or else a wombat or a bird has fallen in; it is poisonous. Bartie has gone a mile with the cart to beg some from the Dalys. " Miss Macintosh taking care of us all so nicely! We have no one in the world but Miss Browne�oh, yes, we have told you lies and lies, but you ought not to have believed them, you should have come to see for yourself that he was happy and well. Oh, if you could hear him crying !�just to hold your hand, he says, and to hear yon talk. Ah! Mother, Mother, Mother, how cruel you are!" But the spirit of the man, just learning to be indomitable, kept him back from long illness. In four days he was up again, easily turned sick and faint, but able to lie on the sofa and even take an interest in the delicacies that Hermie set before him. She had ridden Tramby into Wilgandra herself, gone to the grocer and implored him for nice things�calf's foot jellies, and white-bait, and Canadian tinned fruit. "My sister�Challis Cameron the pianist, will be back soon�l have written for them to come�so you will be sure to be paid." And the grocer, a kindly spot in his heart   

 still for the youngest housekeeper he had ever taken orders from, made up a big basket of tinned goods and said he would wait for Challis to pay him. "Hermie," Cameron said from the sofa on the fifth day, "my head is still confused, but I seem to remember when I was very bad that you kept telling me Mama was coming. There has been no letter, has there ?" Hermie grew a little pale. No, there has been no letter, Papa," she   said. "Hermie," he cried, after spending a minute trying to find the reason for her curiously averted head, " you did not write for Mama, Hermie?" She turned to him then, her blue young eyes on fire. " I did," she said. "It is time, more than time she come. If she does not come soon you �we�we shall all be dead." " Child, child!" he said. He had risen from his sofa and gone to the window to look once more with aching eyes at his wretched lands. If this had been the green isle in the sea he had dreamed of making it, he would have sent long ago himself. But these desolate acres. "Child," he groaned, "I couldn't let her come to this. I am only half a man, half a man. God left the manliness out of me when he made me and gave me womanish ways i- stead. And I have never fought them down as it must have been meant I should do. But I will begin again, I will work harder; things must take a turn, and then I can meet her and she will not despise me. Child, God has no more awful punishment than when He lets those we love despise us. Send another letter, tell her not to come yet�not just yet. Let me have one more chance." Hermie was sobbing at his side, pulling at his arm, trying to urge him back to the sofa. She knew he was not talking to her, knew he was hardly aware she was there, but her sensi- tive spirit, leaping at his troubles with him, was bowed down with the knowledge and weight of them. How she loved this man� this gray-haired, blue eyed man at her side. Hardly the love of daughter for father; her feelings for him had in them something of the passionate, protecting tenderness of a mother for a crippled child. "Lie down," she said. "There�let me move these pillows�that is better. She must come�she should have come long ago. And I told her to be sure to come by the next boat. Now lie still, l am going to get your lunch." The exertion and emotion had tried him exceedingly. He lay still, still, his face to the wall; and now his mood brought a tear from under his eyelid. It was too late! She would have started! Ah! well,praise God for that �God who took these things out of our hands. She was coming, he might give up for a little time and lie with his head on her breast; she who had always forgiven him would forgive him still and clasp him to her and call him " Dear One." Then all he would ask would be the happiness of dying before the world began again. The happy tears rolled down his cheeks. Hermie, tiptoeing back with her tray, saw   them and was filled with dismay.' What had she done by this interference ? "Darling," she said, dropping beside him, " don't mind, don't mind. The letter is not posted yet�Bertie was going to take it in this afternoon�it is not mail day till to-morrow. We will not send it." "Not posted! Not posted ! She was not coming! She might not know of his extremity, his need for her! The chill wind passed over him and dried his tears, dried hie heart. "Here is the letter," the poor child cried. " Don't look like that, darling. I would not vex you for the world. Shall I tear it up ?" He looked at it piteously. Oh ! that Bartie had it, riding with it through the bush, summoning her, summoning her ! "Shall I burn it?" said the poor little girl. " Yes, " he said, " burn it." His voice was   lifeless, his eyes stared dully at the wall. (To be continued.)
