"Passing the Love of Woman." 

 AN AUSTRALIAN STORY. 

 CHAPTER XIII. 

 BY ELLERTON GAY. Author of "Drifting Under the Southern Cross," "Across the Gulf," "Gathered Rue." &c. 

 "Have I dreamed, or was it real?" Philosophy is but a cold and unresponsive companion on the troubled way of life ; it rives no friendly handgrip, 

 no answering gleam to an eye seeking comfort, no echo of ringing tread accompanying the lonely footsteps, no cheery Voice giving assurance of a pre sence. It is at best passive and im personal, a mere makeshift for all there good things that serve to strengthen and cheer the flagging wayfarer. David realised this as he gazed bHndly at the sunset, where crimson and gold gold struggled for mastery, then blended into pale violet and faint green before joining the expanse of blue. To him it seemed pale and colourless, void of any beauty or sentiment of beauty, as he felt himself alone with philosophy. He had closed the door on the light of his life, it only remained to turn the key, and leaving it in the lock (lest a gleam of tremulous light should spring forth through the keyhole), turn his back on it for ever. It was his own choice, and he indulged in no vain re piningB�philosophy was there to prevent that�but he shuddered as he contem plated the road before him, stretched out, a deed level, a blank gray plain, hopelessly dreary and uninteresting, never a flower by the way to give it a charm, nor a bubbling stream to lend it a voice ; not oven s hillock In the dia- 

 i tance. which, onoe reached and mounted, might.from Its small elevation reveal some happier landscape ! And David, ffazing unseeingly at a great lemon tree at the corner of the house, with hoards of yellowing: fruit among tts glossy leaves, saw nothing but the darkness ' that filled his soul. He had come out at the back of the house, from force .of habit, and had reached the sta/bles before he remem bered that he had left his hat behind in the drawing-room. There was" no one J*o^ 1 at the stables, the. ceremonious taking of- his horse when he arrived had been arranged by Mrs. Wentworth to mark the difference of his present visit from those that had gone before, but she had forgotten to give instructions that the man should be in waiting to saddle the horse and bring it round again. David was loth to go back again to face Mrs. Wentoworth, but he could not well ride home without his hat. He tapped at the door, but no one answered. He entered, and found the room empty. Mrs. Wentworth was on the veranda, sitting with her back to the open French windows, fanning herself and rocking her chair restlessly to and fro. Gay was walking up and down Wore her mother, in short, excited turns, talking fiercely and eagerly. David did not -wish to listen, all he wanted was to seize his hat and be off cub quickly as possible. It was good of Gay to see that there had been some hardship in his case ; she wa� nobly Jurt. he thought. He had no desire, however, to be unsettled by hearing her arguments ; his own heart had done its best in that line, but he had conquered .it�stifled it to a dead submission�and he would not for worlds have it quickened again, only to have to go through the same benumbing of the little brood of nestling hopes engen dered there. But he could not find his soft gray hat : most likely tt had been swept off the chair on which foe had laid it by their gowns. He searched every where in the darkened room that no one had thought of lighting when the sun got low. " You are wicked, you are mad, to take his part In this way !" Mrs. Went worth exclaimed, angrily ; "if I could believe it possible I should be inclined to fancy you must be in love with him." " Ah," thought David, " she is speak ing of Jaok. She, too, think� Gay is .in love wUth Mm." Involuntarily he waited with hushed breath for the reply. " In love with him ?" Gay aaid, paus ing in her walk and facing her mother. " Mother, you know what love is. Is it love to feel that you would see your life blood flow drop by drop to save him a p"ang ?. Is it love to tremble and grow cold at the sound of his voice ? To long to isee him, y?t fly to hide when he is near ? To cherish the least word he has said, to .feel your ?whole being thrill at the light, careless .touch of his hand ? To say that if there be shame or sorrow you would take it on youraelf to spare him ? x If this in love, mother�lt is you who have called it by its name�this is what I feel for PhiHp David !" 

 David had hojieatly been looking everywhere for his hat, but at the moment Gay's burning words rushed forth with impetuous passion, he caught sight of It where he hesitated to go and take it. Mrs. Wentworth had doubled it up and�certainly unconscious of the contaminating ownership�was using it to fan herself with. As Oay concluded her impassioned speech with his own name, he had turned to leave the room but. shot .through and 'through with a feeling of inexplicable joy and gladness, he turned and looked once at the slight gracious figure, standing there with long nervous hands gesticulating pic turesquely, and with a deep, unwonted glow in her gray eyes. It was but a momentary glance, but io.tf 6."1^ 1 h. a\\s been "omethlng mag netic in 'the air between them, for, across *we^!.� Ht v^nda and beyond within tne dim room, their eyes met. For the space of a moment Gay gazed steadily, as though she thought it was a vision called up by her words, then her cheeks became slowly suffused with colour, amd she buried her face in her hands. You may well stand there ashamed !" MTf- Wentworth said, after some in articulate murmurs of anger, in an in dignant tone, and unconscious of her �a n U,f h�r' B Mnovery- D�iMd heard ho Joor'b'ehind^fm" " -�ffiy Cl�Bed th*

As Dayfd mounted to ride off there HSLiI^S: a "k 06 c? mmon native flnch, �* ,F on a branch of a peach tree actually singing in Imitation of Gwe?s canary ! David listened with a SJ?" SK, Ur Hi: the *i nBrln� Beemed *o come from his own heart, caused by some, thing new and wonderful that he had never experienced before. It was I something holy and consecrate, not to be touched or handled, only to be in haled as a heavenly perfume, or to be listened to as an entrancing melody � but, oh, how oweet it was ! Nothing was altered, nothing could be altered and yet now there was an Ineffaceable Joy over ail the dull blankness of the way he had to tread. He had no longer to rack his brain for some explanation of his absence to Jack, which should not reveal that he had been to Bende ""1? L. i l6 couM *"* t0 hln� *n enlg matteaa terms of this wonder that had come unsought into his Hfe As he came in sight of Coomdurra. he dwelt on the prospect lovingly. This was where Jack would live and be happy with Owen, when he himself had consummated his sacrifice and was far ?r a$L, wii h w.notllinaf but tne memory of his friendship to cheer him, and tbat 

 other memory, that pure fragrance that had come to him when life had seemed at Ha dullest and deadest. � . � '. .The view from Ooomdurra was over a wMe plain, hemmed in,, except away to the west where It touched the horizon, by a chain of low purple hills ,in the distance. . . The plain rolled in billows like the sea, looking like the furrows ploughed Vy i a race, of giants in primeval days ; it \\ was. yellow, like stubble-fields in Sep l terraber, except where crimson patches showed where bladed grass grew In. coarse tussocks, or where a tongue of bush fire had left blackened ashea, on whidh the first shower would start sweet' green grass, but over all wavered shadows of passing clouds. The creek took a wide bend before the house, and the dam judiciously placed had made a lake of it. Here the bitterns boomed at night, and wild fowl of all sorts, from the.shy grebe to the balder native com panion and black swan, flocked in num bers, and where yellow and white water lilies bloomed, framed in reeds on the calm surface of the water, blue from reflecting an unending succession of cloudless days of blue aky and starlight nights scarcely (kss Wule. Tall aloes reflected their thorn-edged leaves in the shallow water, and tall bare poles and a 'clump of drooping willows contrasted their grace with the bold and faultless symmetry of Norfolk Island pines on the ibank. The garden extended to the water, with rows of vines and peach trees, patches of sweet potatoes and cucum ber and melon vines, and tomatoes itmnnlnar riot in, wild profusion. One cultivation paddock was red with tas selled sorghum, another was deep in purple-flowered lucerne, ready for 'the' scythe. The house had no more pre tension to gracietfull arcMtctoture than other bush dwellings of its day, but it was bright wlith green jalousies and gaily-striped veranda roof, painted like a canvas awning. The roof, on Mr. Wentworth's suggestion, had been divided and gabled to oateh as much mlnwater as possible, so that the outline, in spite of the general sparenees of the mass, iwtas not (unpleasant! to ithe eye. Within, the rooms ?were large and lofty, dHrtgned so as to be thoroughly airy durtng- fhia Jo�g summer, yet capable of' being made cosy and warm during the^ short, sharp winter, when west wtods freeze the marrow and oh 111 the blood. " Where have you been, Davie ?" Jack asked listlessly, making, as It seemed, an effort to speak. " You w4M never guess," David said clwwrily ; "i w4H give you ten, twenty, a hundred guesses." Jack could think of but one place to name, but he would not say Bendemere. " Tell me, old fellow," he said, wearily. "You W:m Sn good *plri'ts, at all events." " Don't ask me to say where, , Jack, but�wHl you believe It ?�I have heard a woman declare she loves me ! Isn't Hhat wonderful enough ?" "Who is ahej?" Jiack asked, half jealous that anyone beside himself should presume to have an affection for Davle. " I must not breathe her name ; the dharm would be broken. It is fetish. Her very ream? is too sweet for words, lit could not be expressed even in a sigh," said David, signing uncon tsciously as he spoke. i "Do I know her ?" Jack was becom ing interested. V You have seen her, but I am sure you do not know her ; not as she has bo3h, revealed to me. Here is Mrs. Smith with�what ? An egg ! You �wiHl �bon be well, Jack�an egg is tfho flrtet mile-post pn the road to conval escence ; a chop is thie second. When ere we to give Mr. Ogllvy a chop, Mrs. Bml Vh ?" 41 To-morrow, sir, if he does not have a bad night," said Mrs. Smith, as she helped David to slip extra pillows under Jack's head. " But there's no fear of that; you are both looking a sight bet ter than you did this time yesterday. If ever anybody's face was the reflection of another*, yours is, sir, of Mr. Ogilvy's. And the reflection looked gloomy enough the first few days. Now, there's the top off your egg, sir ; and .the albumen is Just coaggylated to the right degree ; so eat it up like a dear." Jack obeyed with a promptitude which indicated the first glimmer of an appetite. He was satisfied *with David's explanation, so far as it proved that there would now be no danger of his slipping off and disappearing, like a snowflake on a duckpond, not to be seen again. Later in the evening when David, having perfunctorily despatched the meal Mrs. Smith had placed before him, was again sitting by Jack, reading him out scraps of news from the papers, Jack broke In suddenly in a more ani mated voice than before : " Do you love her, Davie ?" David did.not answer at once; he folded the papers softly, then he rose,' and took a turn up and down the room. " I don't know. Honestly, I don't. It depends on what you call love. Is it love, ,do you think, when the thought of her makes ray head swim and my heart feel like fire, and thrill as never before ? To be Intoxicated by the vision of her presence in every spot my eye falls upon? To long to go on listening to her voice saying she loves me as long as the world lasts ? To hear it in every mur mur around me ? Yet to feel that I would not lay a finger on her to make her mine. To be content to set her in a shrine arid worship her, and not even allow the burning of incense before it, lest some unhallowed beholder should divine the mystery of her presence there ? She is too sacred a being for me to assail with love ; to dream of conquer ing by passion. Jack, perhaps it is vanity, aroused by her confession. Per haps I don't love her at all, and it is nothing but the perfume of an absorb- 

 ing passion that has got into my blood, and is working riot there in some Inex plicaJble way." "When you lose your head, Davie, try and keep your feet," Jack said, with a wan smile. "I think you have lost yours in a lake in the labyrinth of love, and have fallen in head over heels'." . " Then I shall scramble out again the best way I can." "Cynics would say that marriage is the surest bank to land high and dry on, with perfect certainty of a recovery from the immersion." " I shall never marry, Jack. The pivot of love is change, but the pivot of friendship is constancy�a diamond that cannot wear away. To know you are happy�some day�that will be happiness for me." "If we are together, we need neither of us be very miserable," Jack said, stretching out a long, lean hand, blanched by illness, oh David's brown one, lying on the edge of the bed. He felt a weak need of sympathy, and wished David would talk to him of Gwen. " Of course we need not, and" we are not going to be," David said, grasping hia hand warmly. " See the clouds roll up and sweep my vision from my sight to be forgotton for ever ; while the mists are clearing from the hilltops, and you will presently see a hand beckoning you to come up there and be happy." The allusion was clear, and David did not enforce it by further words. " I will climb no hill without you," Jack said, doggedly. " You will go before and make smooth the way. Now, if you are to have a chop to-morrow you must begin your good night's rest," said David, making Jack's pillows comfortable and shading the light. Then he went and smoked on the veranda, and .somewhere out in the dusky garden a bird sang� or was it in his heart ? It mlghit well have been there. Jack's recovery was very slow. The first day (he was out on the veranda Bobbie WentwDrtto and! her fiancee, Frank Stanhope, rode over together to see him and David. Jack flushed pain fuHy at their approach. He would have avoided meeting them if he could, but they canie in, laughing gaily with David, who had been out on the run and had seen them arrive, and, wflvo tided over the first awkwardness of the meeting by an nouncing Bobbie as the future Mrs. Frank Stanhope, Which she promptly corrected to " Mrs. Bobbie." " I have been longing to come and see you both, and so Has} Gay, but we �couldn'it get her tto come to-day ; she said it was too hot�she who always prides herself on never complaining of the heat, so that she may grumble as much as she likes at the cold !" ? The conversation kep'tf to the safe ground of generalities and Jack's ill ness, but both visitors were unfeignedly cordial with Mr. David, and Jack was satisfied so far. No mention was made of Owen or of Mr. and Mrs. Went worth. Qay, they said, had got some new books, and had interred herself in their leaves like a babe in the wood. Her mother had been haranguing her for half-an-'hour for not da/ring a row of pins about something she ought to care for, when Gay looked up placidly at last from " Sordello," wfhich she was. read ing, and said : " A row of pins ? I am afraid I canjt muster more than two or three, but I will go and look." Bobbie waft rather amusing with her little airs of disdain towards Frank, who looked supremely happy, and begged Jocosely that, as she was strong, she might be merciful. " Yes," she said ; " you are weak, but weakness really is strength�a finer quality, nursed carefully, and excused from bard labour �such as brainwork !" " I think I told you before," he re taliated, " that amongst the ' doxes' to be carefully avoided are paradoxes. And you don't know yet, Bobbie, who ate the first oyster ?" " No ; nor whether the primeval oyster didn't eat the first man !" she said. Mrs. Smith brought in tea, and Bobbie poured it out with dainty graclousness,. remembering that Jack took sugar and Mr. David preferred a slice of lemon to cream, and Frank had brought them a lot of lemons from their tree, and when she had ridden away again with Frank, the two men looked at each other with a blank sense of loss. " I wish I knew the girl who lov<3S you, Davie," Jack said, wistfully; " I would find (her out and bring, her here and marry you to her by force !" " She never breathed a word of mar riage ; she might not be prepared to go as far as that; but you know she is only a dream-woman, not common flesh and blood." "Ah !" sighed Jack, and in the dusk he poured out all his heart to Davie, im pressing on (him, however, that for no earthly consideration would he have acted differently, Davie must. not think for a moment that he would have retra.ced his footsteps, even to >keep Gwen for his own.

 We have received from W. H. Paling and Co. a copy of a new song, " Star of the East," by August W. Juncker, com poser of the well-known and popular "I was dreaming," also the songs "All in All" and " Love's last appeal." " Star of the East" is the best of Mr. Juncker's songs, it being full of melody, and very stately in parts, with a fine accompani ment. It waB composed expressly for, and dedicated to, Mr. Philip Newbury, the celebrated tenor, and, being sung by him, needs no further recommendation. This song is sure to become as popular as the composers other works, which, in our opinion, it excels. The words are by W. R. Russell Rogers*
