 i,Tala of Westwn Love. 

 Chaffbb X. 

 Tom Drysdale and Ned Blue were in love -with the Bame little dark-haired, blue-eyed, ditople-cheeked, maiden-as madly in love as men could be. 

 They were stockmen on her uncle's utation, and as brftve*bearted young colonials as ever cracked a whip in a moonlight muster, or rode a brumby over 

 a two-railed fence.

 Molly was the maiden's name; The " Prairy FlowV' of those great myall downs, where love thrives like Bathurst Burr in a Roma paddock, or a bush fire on Cooper's Greek. 

 Love is said to be the "Breath of Heaven." It is more-it is the " Motto of Heaven," and cements Jbhe universe. You may stop the 'flow of the Brisbane River, the jaw of Billy BrookeB, the Telegraph newspaper, bnt true love, never. 

 Don't try.
