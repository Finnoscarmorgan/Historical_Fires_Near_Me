 . Liko the apostles, lie toiled with liis liandB and wont about, in his unloarncd way, striving to do good. Who shall �ay that somo of tho seed thus unskilfully sown did not fall upon good ground, and bring forth increaso V It wns a strangely solemn sight to seo . n cotiplo of hundred rough, sun-bronzed, tearded men, clad in thoir clay-stained . habiliments, standing bareheaded under the tnll trees, through whoso boughs the wind sangagentlo requiem over tho dead, listening to 'tho words of blessed pro mise,' nnd to tho rattle of tho earth on 

 tho coffin of their late comrade.. After tho funeral a committee was ap tiointod to deal with tho deceased man's belongings. HiB mining implements, blankets, tent, and so on, wero, of cotirqe, given to hiB party ; but a portrait, a ?Biblo, and a watch, which wo found in his swng, and a look of his hair, woro sent, with a nolo containing a tow words of sympathy, to tho addrosB on a lettor from 3] is mother, in Boston. Tho mystery was novor cleared up on the flat, nor could wo fairly fix suspici on'' on any individual. Cortninly thero wero sonio queer characters amongst us� mon cnpablo, probnbly, of any villainy� but that (old nothing; and amongstTraon whoso hands had to keep thoir heads, and who were not slow to avenge an inBult or injury, it was not a safe thing to hazard a suspicion that could not bo substantiated. I Truo, hnd tho outrage been sheotcd homo to anyone, it is likely that, immediately after tho murder at nil ovents, a short shrift and a long cord would, have been bis doom ; for, although lynch law never obtained on tho Australian goldfields, still the diggers of tho early days wero ^ * ' Uio men to stick at trifles. '.If was very unpleasant, this uncertain ly. Oloarly onougli the doed had boon committed, but who was to blamo? Men� evon in some cases mates� grow strnngo and shy of one another ; many loft for other places ; and heartburnings, dissension, and jealousy reigned iu our litllo community, until ono day camo a terrible eatastropho, thnt drove the mem ory of tho murder from mono minds, and gavo them other affairs, in which thoy were more immediately interested, to talk of. ^ ' : - 

 . ' CHAPTER XVI; - FIRE ! FIRE I It was December, 1854. Wo� lhat is, Jim and myself, for somo of our party hud left and gone , to one or othor of '.tho now .diggings that woro brooking out' every day�had boen on tho crook for more .than a year, and, taking one thing with another, had dono very woll'indbcd. Wo had lind Iettora from homo, con staining but littlo of interost to me, save thoso which camo from my uncle, and whioh mortly told mo of tho wall-being of himself, tho family, and of Bella. I 'ncvor wroto to her directly, nor/the to mo,' for there was a tnoit understanding thut I was not as yet an Accepted lover, and myprido forbade my doing anything underhand to win lii-v. but nevor a .lettor camo from him that did not contain a bluo_ 'Forgot- liie-not,' withered and faded it is true, but still a ''Forgot-mo- nof.' I know who sent it.' How it got into tho lettor I did not know. Whether it was put in by stonlth, or whother tho old man hnpponed to bo looking another way whon tho lettor wns sealed, I could i not toll, but thero it was. My father's letters woro as rogulnr and as niothodicul ns his own book-keeping, and oneo I. had u missive from Charlie, a kind of duty lettor, whioh I aa dutifully answered. That ho hnd not aped in bin wofting I well know ; tho bonuio bluo llowera told me that, for I know that Bolla was too lionost nnd trno a girl to givo her hand to ono, and to send lovo tokons Io another. And thus with ino had tho time gono on, toiling hard at tho precarious labour of gold digging ; 1 had gono on stondily making monoy, and, although noitlior Jim nor myself- woro either; mean or . stingy* wo did not, as too ?ninny did, - ? pluugo recklessly into tho wild whirl of mad, riotous living that characterised all the digging townships of those days. Wo ' had dono sometimes well, sometimes bad ly, and though we had not made any of tho monster finds that sot tho world nblnzo with excitement, yot wo had money in tho bank, and wero well satis . ? lied. , , ? : ? Tlio diggings� which, by tho way, I may mention, for reasons that tlioBe who have boon thorp will understand, were not on Fiery Creek, but on ono of ita head tributaries� were not of any groat extent ; tho ground'wnB'veiy patchy, and tho. smiting difficult ; and iiiany men pro ierred,,aftor ii fow trials, to try tho moro . extonsivo workings lower down, and on : tho main creek itself. : Yet there was of courao, tho usual ? .quantity of straggling stores and grog shanties to supply tho necessities and luxuries for a couplo of hundred men, for ' at about that number our littlo communi ty steadily kept. Taken for all in all, wo woro a peaceablo lot ; for, although thero were frequent quarrola and fights and drunkon brawls, yet tho good aense of . tho majority had sufficient. rostraint on tho wilder nnd moro reckloss-onoa to pre vent any serious outbreak si- I began this ohaptor by saying thnt it : was in December, 1854. Those who ro member tho ond of 1801 will also remem ber that tho soason was an excoptionnlly hot ono. Whilo folks at homo woro shivering under tho hard frost and heavy snow of Old Britain, thoso in this newer . Britain woro Bweltering beneath tho ficrco heat of a semi-tropical sumpior. Whilo they there woro wrapping! themsolves close iir their greatcoatB uiidTTrSh-thon.. ! faBhionablo plaids, we hero 'woro dolling our garments, and almost fishing, with ' the humourist, thnt 'wo co'uld tako off our flush, and walk about :in our bonos.' It. wiis hot, hot, burning, broiling hot, from tho rising of tho sun Jill tho sotting of tho same ; and then it was hot, hot, Olickly, liumidly, oppressively hot, bo hot, so densely, overpoweringly hot, as to render aimplo respiration a burden, a ' trouble, a nuisance, and d task, until long t ; lifter midnight. There used to bo an old '? story about a iackuos in Ltvcrpool that was too lazy to tlnuv atiyt)ii|ig, und that ,� Jlfi. I ' if ? ' i I. 

 when ho wanted to dio ho sent for another jackass to help him to draw his last breath. 'Tho bearing of this story lies in tho application thereof,' so far as tho offeet of tho heat of that summer is con cerned. Mon felt, not with regard to their last breath, but with regard to breathing genorally, qb if thoy wanted assistance to hreatho at all. Tho only timo when men could foel themselves to livo, bo to speak, was in tho early morn ing, when tho dow rosted on tho drooping leaves, and on tho tonts that shimniored whitcly in tho dim twilight, beforo the liorce sun camo up ablazo, like a barbaric Eastern potentato in all his glory, to chase tho thin mist and the cooling mois turo from tho faco of the oartli. There had been no rain for weeks and weeks ; tho sky, undecked oven by tho faintcBt shadow of tho most llcecy cloud, was bluo, bluo, deeply, unaltorably-bl'uo. Tlioro was rarely a* breath of wind, and whon thnf did eomo, it was ever from tho north nnd west � a wind that camo ovor hundreds of leagues of burning, sterilo, sandy, and stony desert, of dried up salt lakes, and of otherwise the vast plains whero tho Bad, silent abomination of deso lation reigns. It was ever from the north and wost, and . it beat upon our alrondy parched and fevered faceB liko the blast of a furnace. Tho earth was parched, and gasped thirstily for wator ; tho grass wa3 soro and yollow ; and tho trecB and bushoB hung languidly and dustily in tho glowing sunshino. Tho creeks had dried up, or had shrunken into mero chains of waterlioles or threads of runnels, and the lakes wero salt-bordored swamps. Cattlo droopod, and lolled out their long tongues bonoath tho delusive refuge of tho ahadelesB trees ; and men worked faintly amidst sweat and dust, and drank, and smoked, and grumbled the wliolo day long. TJio cicadas which chirped their ceasolesff song from morn to night, and tho mosquitos that p-r-r-red round both morn and night, wero tho only living things that seemed to onjoy tho fun. Everything was saturated with heat � tho earth until it cracked, the atmosphere until it quivered. Tho bush fires ragod on tlio distant rangos to the north and tho far away plains to tho wost, with dense clouds of dark amoko in the day, and a dull lurid glare in tho night. It, was bb if 'the earth should molt liko wax, nnd tho lioavens bo dissolved with fervent heat.' Day after day this lasted, day after day it bccamo more intense, until tlie sparse herbage crackled underfoot, and the driud-up leaves of the gum trees darkened and hung listlessly from their scorched boughs. Ouo Sunday forenoon, just beforo twelve o'clock, when the aun was beating fiercely on tho baked earth � 1 waB lying panting in my tent at the time, having givon sleop up as a bad job � there was ,i sudden alarm, a cry, a lush of hurrying feet, and I rouaod myself sufficiently to get up and look out. I Bnw a sight which made my heart leap into my mouth. The lisea closo by wero in a blaze, nnd tho fire, leaping from tree to tree and from bush to buaii, and licking up tlio brown grass beneath,- was rapidly travelling downwards towards tho flat. Cattlo and horsos woro flying madly away in all directions, mobs of kangaroos flopping over tho flats, blundering into tho tents or anywhere elso in their terror, nnd flocks of pnrrots, laughing jackaBBes, leatherheads, and othor birds screaming overhead, or dropping into the blinding and suffocating smoke. Mon wero hurry ing hither and thither, bowildored, and not knowing what to do or whero to turn, for the firo was on thorn on both sides of tho crook. Suddenly a voicc � it was Jim Cragg's � rang out as if by inspiration, 'Down tho holes, 111011 1' and it was passed on from niuuth to mouth to tho furthermost part of tho flat. The effect was electri cal ; as if in an instant tho flat was cleared. What was a fow, very few, minuteB boforo a scone of busy life, was now as barren, save for tho presence of a low empty and desorted shanties, and fpr tho heaps of wnahdi.'t, which looked liko gigantic molehills, as it had boon before tho foot of tho white man trod it. Touts, stores, bedding, everything that would burn, tossed liurly-burly, higgledypiggle dy down tho aliafts, with their owners Bitting on thorn, waiting with boating hearts tho coining of tbo enemy they wero powerless to rosist. Nor had they long to wait, for, in a shorter time than it takos to toll, down came tho fierco flamo with a swish and a swirl amongst the brown grass, and a wild roar, liko the booming of distant artillery, ns it caught the dry plumago of tho troos and the bare stumps and limbs of thoso that wero dead. This was a sorious blow for some of tho storekeepers; for, beBido tho fact that most of tlioin had to leave a groat portion of tlioir stocks in their ahanties, to bo consumed by tho firo, a atill greater por tion was amaBhod or irrotriovably ruined by boing thrown into tho liolea. Still, it could not bo helped, and so thoy hnd to conaolo thomsolvcs ns beflt thoy might, by reflecting that it was tho fortune of war, and that thoir profitB wero so huge that they could ull'ord it. Ono young follow, a Jow, named Isaao Marks, familiarly known aa 'Ikoy,' who had not heon long on tho flat, and who was only just commencing business, I was especially sorry for. Ho was a quiet, decent, civil ohap, generally lilted in tho camp for his cheery and obliging manner. Ho was, although very closo and oxact in mattere of business, liberal, ovon gonorouB, in liia way ; and many a poor fellow, both Jo1* and Centilo, had nmplo' reason to bo grateful to Ikoy for a free feed, or for ' tucker' for his Bwag, whon, flat broke, ho determined to try his luck olsewhore. Ikey's atoro� a few Blabs, hastily put up, nnd having a bark roof� lay back on tlio flat, Bomo distance from tho workings, and about a hundrod and fifty yards from us, who wero his noarost neighbours. Wo tried to givo him a hand whon wo had mado all right for ourselves ; but it was only a littlo wo could do, for Backs of flour and clioBts of tea wero not handy things to carry. However, wo nianagod to get away with some Blops nnd blankets, leaving the heavier goods to tako caro of thomselves, Ikoy was as ono demonted, and it was with great trouble wo forced him out of harm's way hiniBolf. I novcr saw a man so thoroughly broken-hoarled. IIo sat down and criod like a child. ' Oh, my boautiful goodtli 1 Oh, I'm ruiiied, ruined� all gone, everything gono � oh I oh I oh !' Wo tried to cheer him up, telling him that ho ought, to bo glad to havo saved what ho had, that it couldn't bo helped, tliaF'thero waB no good to bo got by grieving, and so on ; but it was of no avail, for atill ho Bat lamonting. 'Vat'll Phillipth thjiy to mo � vat'll Cohenth thay to mo, noctlit month? Oh, I'm broke for over� ruined, ruined I Oh I oh 1' Wo pitiod tho poor follow oxcoedingly, but we could hnrdly help laughing at his wild, irrational grief ; for wo knew well enough that neither Phillips, nor Cohen, nor all tlie oliildren of Israol could help what wns done, nnd that thoy would re stock him soon enough, and let bit bills ? % 

 lio over for a time. Wo told him ns much, but ho would not bo comforted ; and so wo allowed bim havo his cry out. Tho flat presented a curious scene when wo got out of our harbours of refuge. Tho earth hot, black, bare, with here and thero a tussock still smouldering. Tlio smoko rosp with a denso, acrid fumo, and rolled in n thick, groy cloud overhoad ; and tho air was imprognatod with tiio sharp smell of charred timber and burnt foliage, and thick with smuts that floated gontly downward liko black snowllakes. It was curious to seo tho men crawling out of tho holes, liko bo many rabbits out of a warron, and hauling up their treas ures as if they had been drawing water from a well. After all, thero had not boon so much damago done as might have been expect ed, for the grass had been so dry that tho firo had passed by liko a flash, and hardly any of tho stores had really taken lire. Two of them wero, however, blazing morrily, and in others tho firo was smouldering. Thoy woro Boon put out, though, for everybody lent a hand. We helped Ikoy at his ; and when ho saw how littlo hud really been destroyed, ho bocamo as loud in his exxiressions of do light as ho had boon in his moans uf despair. His dray was untouched � tho paint a littlo blistered, that was nil ; his Hour bags somewhat singed ; and his* hams aud bacon got a littlo preliminary touch of frying, which sent a rather un Hebrew-liko aroma into our nostrils. Otherwise, tho damage was very slight ; and whon ho got his things out of tho hole into which wo hnd thrown them, tho placo looked almost the samo as be fore. Ho was profuse in his expressions of gratitude, and liia promises to do a good turn for us if ovor ho could (proniia- s which I afterwards found were really meant, and not. tho idlo wind such pro mises generally turn out), and insisted on our having some champagne, a fow bottles of which ho kept on tl.o sly. It did not tako long to put things to rights on tho flat. The romnants of tho fire were beaten nnd trodden out ; and amidst tho laughter and ringing morri ment of tho men, who, now tho danger was over, began to view tho affair in tho light of a hugo practical joko, tbo whito tonts were soon gleaming again in the sunlight. What was tho cause of this Buddon firo V As tho Spaniards say, ' Quien sabe't' Perhaps a lighted match thrown down amongst tho dry grass by some carolcas swagman on tho other sido of the rises; porhupa a camp fire left burning at tho foot of a hollow tree, which, catching' would blaze like a fur nace up the flue-like interior ; porlmps a bit of broken bottle acting as a burning glass. All these things have been, ero now, causes of conflagrations more ter rible and destructive than this. CHAPTER XVII. WATER.' After all, wo wero moro frightened than hurt, for in reality tho damage done was not to any great extent, aud savo that it took us some time to gob our cattlo back from tho swamps where they had instinc tively taken _ refuge, things wero very soon in the' samo Btate as thoy had been before the firo. Christmas and the Now Year had eomo and gono � wo had eaten tho conventional roaBt beof and plum pudding, in our shirt sloevcs, nnd in tho open air, under tho shade of a friendly tree that sheltered us from the fierce rays of tho aun over head � and wo wore getting far into autumn. It had been nn exceptionally hot season, and save a fow showers, which barely sufficed to keep tho water holos from failing, wo liad had no rain during tho year. But it came at last. We wished for it, and wo got what wo wished for � a littlo moro than wo wished for, as you shall soe. It was a sultry day in March� about tho 201'u, I think � when tho rain com menced to fall. It had beon singularly dark and hoavy for days boforo � a muggy atmosphere, ns thoy say, hot and unpleas ant. The cattlo Boomed uneasy and rcBt lesa, and the flies woro exceedingly troublasomo. It was ob if the air woro lndon with somothing that mude every body feel dull and dispiritsd. Electri city, perhaps, or a prescience of coming calamity. On tho day I havo named, tho sky bogan to gloom, and tho atmo spliero to thicken. A few fitful gusts of wind lind been blowing from tlio south east during tho night, wailing mournfully through the trees ; nnd about noon, black, low-lying clouds began to steal up from tho horizon. The rain was heralded by a few light pattering drops, followed by a sharp shower that fell away to Scotch mist. This continuod until night fall, and then came tho Btorm. Anything grandor than that tempest in the bush can scarcely be conceived. Tho rain fell in torrents, and our tents, the ropca of which had boon Blackened by the hoat, bccamo tight aa drums. Tho night was dark as pitch, save when every fow seconds tho surrouuding country was literally lit up with a woird, unearthly glaro o� vivid lightning, that played on every hand, and that shot athwart us with a blinding flash, rendering tho black darkness still moro dark. Tho thunder broke incessantly � now with a deafening crash that seemed to shako tho very earth beneath our foet, now rolling in a low rumble amongBt tho ochoing hills, - Happy those whoso tents wore water tight and had flies to them, that dismal night ; happy thoso who had had the foresight to erect bunks in them to keep thorn off tho ground. Toward inovniug the thunderstorm bore away to tho north. Not ao the rain. That continuod to fall harder and harder, thicker and faBter, with a steady down pour, aB if tho windows of heaven had boon unloosed. Ab tho day broko darkly and gloomily, the aspect was ono the revorso of inspiriting. Tho rain com pletely shut out tho viow of tho surround ing country ; and tho creok, which yes torday was a moro chain of littlo pools, waB now ruBhing hoarsely by, a raging torrent. Tlio trickling waterfalls wore transformed into fierce cataracts of yollow water, that leapt from rock to rock, with a harsh roar, into the troubled pools benoath. Fast ns tho rain fell, however, there was no wator on tho flat. That was a pleasure to eomo. Tho thirsty earth drank up tho gratoful moisture as fast as it fell, and although walking iu tho mud was unploasant, it waB not difficult, as the earth wns firm underneath. It was a diamal day in good sooth. The cattle stood moping unilor tho trees ; dogs woro shivering under tho drays, or whorovor elso thoy could find Blieltor ; and hero nnd thero might bo soon a minor wrappod up in hiB oilBlcinS, piling up his fuol in n dry placo, or droarily keeping His firo up. Most of ua had chimney tiro I'iao.'B, bo that, although tho hoavy rain boat down them, nnd liissod and sputtered amongBt tlio glowing ombors, there was no fear of our fires going out � whilo wo had wood.� To de CoNmyEi), L F '
