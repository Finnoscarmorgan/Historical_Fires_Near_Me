 CHAPTER XIX. The New Governess at Yarhamundoe. 

 Onb of the first movements of Mr. and Mrs. Wilton, after seeing Kate eff, was to look for a suitable governess for their daughters. But they soon found (as so many other families in the bush have done) ( that it was not easy to secure the services of a lady 'who posseted all the essentials as a tutoress and also j the desirable qualities of an agreeable home com- !

At length their advertisement introduced them to a lady, whose testimonials from persons with high sounding names in London, promised much for her abilities as a governess ; moreover, her manners were ladylike and her disposition seemed amiable in the extreme. Her references' to persons in Sydney were also satisfactory, so far as they went, but as Mrs. Glyder had only been a month in the colony, her Sydney referees confessed that their acquaintance with her was not a lengthy one. She stated that she was the widow of an officer in the Indian army, and that she was in receipt of a small pension. She was desirous of securing a home with a respectable family in the country, and salary was but a secondary con sideration. Aftei much deliberation, Mr. and Mrs. Wilton de cided to engage Mrs. Glyder, as she was by far the most eligible of the few applicants for the situation. They were not much pleased with the readiness she showed to adapt herself to circumstances, when Mr. Wilton, with his accustomed delicacy, asked her to which section of the Christian Church she adhered, and they formed the not unreasonable conclusion that the was sadly careless of the all-important concerns of life. They were too liberal-hearted, however, to discard her on that account, and they hoped that by and-by they might � through the influence of example � see her 'more stablished in her views of religion as a duty. Emma and Jenny grieved very much for the loss of Kate ; and they could not at once reconcile themselves 1 to their new governess, although, her demeanour was soft and affable to a dfegree, and her school discipline even lees rigid than Kate's was. But after a while they got to like Mrs. Glyder, for though she was quite as old as their mamma, she had a wondrous adaptability, and could at times be as merry atid frolicsome as Jenny herself. She had travelled a good deal, and was evidently very observant, and her young pupils were never weary of listeningto her descriptions of life on parts of the Continent of Europe or in India. She could' not be induced to venture on horseback, but she was iond of taking long rambles in the bush, on half-holidays or on summer evenings. Emma and Jenny usually accompanied her, and when she had exhausted her tales of travel she would read to them from story books, of which she had quite a large stock In her trunks. Several months passed away without anything oc curring to ruffle the even tenor of life at Yarramuu doe. Emma and Jenny were making satisfactory progress with their studies, in music especially, for Mrs. Glyder was an excellent, pianist, and Mr. and Mrs. Wilton were pleased that they had been so fertunate as to secure so proficient a tutoress for their dear girls, when by a mere accident a discovery was made, which at once destroyed all their confidence in Mrs. Glyder's honesty of principle. One afternoon Jenny was sitting in a sunny part of the front ver andah, and was so deeply absorbed in a book that she did not notice the approach of her papa until he was seated beside her. � You have grown a surprisingly close reader of late, Jenny,' he said in a playful mood. ' What are . you studying bo abstractedly ? ' ' It is a book Mrs. Glyder lent me, papa. It is so very interesting, and I want to finish it before tea time.' Without the least suspicion of the subtle character of tbe book, Mr. Wilton glanced down the page Jenny was then reading, butjthat hasty look was enough to incite him to examine the book more carefully. It is needless to .describe too minutely the concern of Mr. and Mrs. Wilton on discovering that for several months their confiding girls had been assiddously reading books supplied by their governess, the covert design and the tendency of which were to undermine the religious principles and doctrines which their * parents had so sedulously inculcated. That little episode in my story is not fiction, [what ever other parts may be. Judicious parents will doubtless know how to exercise the caution it sug gests, without any farther hints or explanation from me. Mrs. Glyder left Yarramundoe for good in a few days, and soon afterwards her place was filled by the daughter of a neighbouring settler, who, though not sd highly accomplished as her predecessor, she was in other respects thoroughly reliable. Mr. Thompson keenly felt, the absence of his be loved Kate, but there was no mawkish sentimentality in hiB nature, so he did not perpetually strive to make his face Ipok van and woeful (as not a few love-sick youths have done, in order to enlist the sympathy of thtir friends), and his manner in the family circle was almost B8 cheerful as it was when his heart was free from love's emartings. He sometimes spoke of Kate to Mrs. Wilton -with a hopefulness in ms tone which both pleased and surprised her ; but for all that he had seasons of depression during which his hope grew very feeble, and his prospect of conjugal bliss seemed es- undefined as the footway through toe brush by the river bank, which was entangled by wild vines and oeepere. 'Ah! well! it will be all right, which ever way it may turn out ? that point is settled in my Blind. I have done all I could oo .that wflfi f&ir and honourable, and now I must patiently await the re sult.' That was usually sometning like the summing up of his dreary cogitations. In order to give hiB mind 2ess encouragement to wear itself to waste ovexainatter which no amount of thinking could alter^ he bought 

 some of the works on geology and chemistry, and bt gan to study those sciences in earnest. About seven months after Kate's departure Walter rode out one day with the stockman for the purpose of driving some young colts into the branding yard. To persons unacquainted with bush adventures, I may say that perhaps no equestrianism is more hazardous to life and limb than that of riding over a thickly timbered country after young horseB ; and it is espe cially so if the ground is ofra rocky uneven character. Part of Mr. Wilton's run was on the slopes of a moun tain, and was intersected by numerous ravines or blind gullies. When galloping down one of these steep places, in the attempt to head a mob of young horses, Walter's horse fell and he was thrown across a log, and his left thigh waB fractured. As quickly as practicable he was carried to the homestead, and a suTgenn was sent for, who set the broken bones, and poor Walter was doomed to lie quietly on his back for an indefinite period. A person who has always been exempt from bodily ailments, and who has perhaps never been confined to his room for a single day by sickness, is seldom found to be very patient nnder a similar mishap to that which kept Walter to his bed, for the first time in his ? life. His surgeon fully impressed him with the ne . cessity of lying perfectly still for a time, and he yielded implicit obedience ; but O what a trying, wearisome season it wbs for him ! Who can even imagine it, 6ave one who has had a like pkinful ex perience. Mr. and Mrs. Wilton were unremitting in their attention to the sufferer, and Emma and Jenny often eat in hiB room and read to him. He was grate ful for thekindness of his friends, and tried to show that he was so ; but all the comforts which hiB gentle nurses could minister to him, and all his reflections on the unhappy position of some poor mortals, who have to suffer agonies of pain in the midst of squalid poverty and neglect, did not long console his chafing spirit, and he sometimes � when no one was near him � covered his head with the bed-clothes and howled, not with pain, but with impatience at his helpless ness. But by degress his unruly spirit was convinced that it must be passive, and then he grew calmly resigned to his lot. His fracture was a compound one, and it was nearly four months before he could venture out of his room on cratches, and two months more before he could discard those useful but much abhorred helps. No poor wretch in a prison cell ever longed for liberty more ardently than Walter longed for the power to mount his horse again. Time kindly brought him the much wished for boon, and how his softened spirit gushed over with gratitude and delight the first time he took a canter through the bush, and heard his old pets the wild birds chirping out their notes of welcome, and felt the warm sunshiie enlivining his bed-worn bones ! But he soon found that his constitu tion had received a shock from his late accident, which would not soon rally away ; his strength did not return, his appetite failed, and he was most reluctantly obliged to own himself an invalid. Sympathy poured in upon him from all quarters, but it did not make him any better, neither did the num berless homely remedies which friends and neigh bours prescribed, in the excess of their kindness : he gradually grew weaker, and a dry hacking cough dis turbed his rest et night, and Bometimes made him fancy that his days on earth were numbered. At length he was persuaded to consult a physician of high repute in the district, who recommended him to take a sea voyage to some warmer climate, as the most likely means Jo restore him to health and vigour. ' Do you think a voyage to England would benefit me, doctor ? ' asked Walter, and his heart leaped at the idea ot duty leading him right up to dear Kate's door, which was just the direction he had for months past longed that duty would point his course. 'By no means, sir. Too cold for .you, at this season of the year especially. I think you told me that you were born in the tropics ? ' ' Yes sir, and my father .is at present living on one of the islands not far frohi Tahiti.' ' Then go and see your father, my dear sir. Nothing in the world, that I know of, will do you more good than the voyage to that part, and the sooner you start away the better.' * * * ' I wish I were sick enough to be ordered away to some nice mild quarters for a change,' drily remarked Jem Brown, one of Mr. Wilton's convict men, as he was cording up Walter's travelling trunks. ' Do you mean to say you would like to be an in valid, Jem, for the sake of being coddled.' ' My word I would, sir ! Stewed chicken and port wine, and other nice fattening tack, and a long spell with nothing to do, would be a rare change from my hard rations and bursting bush work.' �' Well, let me tell you seriously, Jem, that you make a mistake. You have not had much sickness, I dare eay�' ?- Never was ill in my lite that I can remember, sir. I have had toothache now and again, and a few bites from centipedes in the bush, and lots of splinters, but feem sort of trifles ar'n't worth talking about.' ' Depend on it, Jem, that a sound body is one of the greatest blessings in life ; and you have that, whatever tlse you may lack. There are, I dare say, thousands of men in the world who would, if it were SOBsible, willingly exchange wealth for robust health. [any pain-tracked lords would perhaps gladly give their titles if they could insure such health as you have ; so prize it, Jem, and do not commit any excess that will tend to make you an invalid, for there is .much less satisfaction in being coddled than you imaging ; and even 6tewed chicken is not a luxury to a man who has no appetite for it.' ? . A few days afterwards Walter sailed for Tahiti. CHAPTER XX. Tee Voyages of Walteb Thompsons The vessel that Walter sailed from Sydney . in was a large American schooner, with very taunt masts and fore-and-aft sails ; a favourite rig with the Americans. No doubt they find it handy enough for their lake navigation, but it is not a desirable rig for a sea-going craft, especially on a long voyage ; and it is not always possible to ship a crew who are smart enough to handle such a craft in a strong breeze. Most of the crew of the Sylph had been used to square-rigged vessels ; and it was mainly owing to that circumstance that a series of mishaps occurred, which protracted the voyage, and made it too dangerously exciting, and withal too ex haustive ot the steward's stores, to be very restoring to the health of an invalid. Soon after leaving Sydney one of the crew, who was dozing at the helm, was knocked overboard and drowned, by the sudden surging of the ponderous main boom ; and a few days afterwards, when running in a strong breeze, the boom guy broke, and the mainsail jibed over and sprung the head of the mainmast.. Then a hard gale of wind set in from the south-east, and the vessel, in her crippled condition, was set so far to leeward of her course, that it was deemed expedient to make for the Friendly Islands to refit. , The Sylph lay in the spacious harbour of vavau for three weeks, and during that time Walter was the welcome guest cf one of the missionaries at Neucalo foa. Did my space permit, I should be tempted to give some extracts from Walter's journal, which ex press, in almost rapturous terms, his admiration of the natural beauties of that little group of islands, and hiB gratification at the happy results of missionary labours, which he had many opportunities of observing. 

 About a fortnight after leaving Vavau the Sylph reached Tahiti, when' Walter learned' that 'his father was stationed on an island about two degrees to the eastwaYd. Thither he proceeded in a small sloop, and met with a* very loving reception from his father and his excellent step-mother. The particulars of Walter's sojourn for seven months among the Society Islands would make several interesting chapters, but I must hasten on with my narrative. The revivifying influ ence of that genial climate soon told upon his weak ened frame, and his pure native air proved far more beneficial than physic. In a few months his strength returned, and the horrible depression, which had so long kept his mind hovering over his grave, dispersed like mist in a valley when the sun pours down his meridian beams, and the world again seemed worth living in. Often he regretted that his health had not permitted him, in early life, to continue the studies neceBsary to qualify him for this mission. field ; for though there was not much in a missionary's every day routine to arouse an enthusiasm such as. is often displayed at valedictory meetings, it was a work in which he felt be could cheerfully devote his life's enegries, if he had a wife who was equally earnest in the good cause. After taking a tender farewell of his beloved parents, he returned to Tahiti, and in a few days he embarked in the brig Hornet, which was bound to Sydney direct. He had been at sea about a week, when one night he waB aroused from his slumbers by an unusual noise overhead. He hastily dressed and went on deck, but at first he could see nothing to warrant the bustle and excitement which was going on, and the captain and crew were too busy for him to put any questions to them just then. It was a fine moon light night, the sea was as smooth as glass except for j the long rolling swell ; there was not a breath of wind, i and the sailB flapped lazily against the masts. At length Walter summoned courage to ask the captain j what was the matter ? | 'Matter, indeed! Can't you see the reef yonder?' Walter looked in the direction indicated, and after a -while he could discern something like a curl on the water, upon which the moonbeams were flickering. It did not appear very formidable to him, so he was not at all alarmed, and walked the deck calmly looking at the crew in the boat ahead, who were trying to tow the vessel in the opposite direction. He soon 1 saw, however, that they were nearing the reef, and he could at times hear the sullen roar of the surf. 'Lay alongside with the boat!' shouted the captain ; and then he muttered to himself, ' It's no use towing ; the current is setting right over the reef, two knots an hour.' ?? Would not the anchorB stop her, captain ?' asked Walter, in a deprecatory tone, conscious that he was asking a question on a professional matter, of which he knew little or nothing. ' It you can find the bottom, I'll let go an anchor, pretty quick,' replied the captain, testily. 'Onto the reef we shall go in half an hour, unless a breeze springs up. You had better go below and stow a few traps into your carpet-bag, Mr. Thompson, and bear in mind we can't take much luggage. Now, then, all hands, hoist out the longboat. Steward !? get some' ' small stores ready to put into the boat. Look alive, all of us ! ' ! Walter went to his cabin in a state of trepidation that he had never before felt at sea.. He hastily packed j a few articles of clothing and the contents of his writ- i ing desk into a small portmanteau, and taking his | cloak over his arm he re-ascended to the deck. It ; cost him a severe pang to leave behind him his books, 1 and the large collection of island curiosities, which his father and other friends had given to him ; but there was no alternative. The longboat was safely hoisted out, and several casks of water and bags of biscuit and other stores were put into it ; the crew were then ordered into the boat, and were followed by Walter and the captain. A few minutes afterwards the brig was grinding broadside on to the reef. ' Half an hour of that work will rub a thoroughfare through the old Hornet's bilges,' muttered the cap tain, with a sorrowful look at his doomed vessel. ' Well, we can't help it. Mortal man can't stay the ocean currents. We have done all we could do, any Low. Light your pipes, boys ! You'll have a long pull by-and-by. We'll lay by her till daylight, if she floats so long.' Walter had often read tales of shipwrecks, and used to fancy that there was a lively excitement in ths danger, somewhat like riding through a bush fire, or galloping across a rough country in pursuit of a mounted bushranger. His experience of sea life � as I before stated � was very limited. Except regret at the loss of bo many valuable effects, he felt but little personal concern at the mishap, which had left him with thir teen other men in an open boat, . and several hundred miles away from any civilized land. The reef was an isolated coral patch, which rose up straight as a cliff through the blue waters, and was . only dry at neap tides ; and after the brig went down, close beside the reef, not a vestige of her could be seen, except some loose gear which floated off her decks. But all the lively excitement he felt was not worth much, , and the eclat he anticipated in the future at the narration o'f; hiB shipwreck, by his home fireside, did not long promise an adequate compensation for the real hard ships he was doomed to endure, and which tested his newly-restored strength to the utmost. Gently rock ing on a glasBy sea, in the fall moonlight, waiting to see the Hornet Bink, while the crew were quietly smoking their pipes, was the only bit of romance which Walter could afterwards recall from his ten days and nights weary cruising in the longboat, exposed to a tropical sun and often to fierce thunderstorms, and for twenty hours to the fury of a gale, which threatened every moment to engulph the boat and all on board. Nor were the perils of the sea all he had to dread, for three of the crew became mad, through drinking to excess from a cask of rum which waB un luckily put into the boat, and the lives of all the other men were in peril from the fury of the wretched maniacs, one of whom jumped overboard. The other two were at length overpowered and bound hands and feet. But their horrible imprecations, as they lay huddled in the fore part of the boat, were far more appalling to Walter than the hissing waves and the blue lightning. One dark, squally night, Walter was coiled up in his usual place in the sternsheets of the boat. Every article of his clothing was wet through, and his strength and spirits were, alike almost exhausted. Suddenly he was aroused from an uneasy doze, by the captain, who was at the helm, shouting out, ' Ship ahoy ! Ship ahoy ! Don't run over us ! Port ! Port ! ' He threw his wet cloak from off his head just in time to see a lofty^ship, under a press of sail, dash close past tile boat. It had, indeed, almost ran over them. The excitement was intense, as, notwith . standing the repeated shoutings of all in the boat, the ship passed rapidly by, apparently without noticing them. Then for a few minutes despair seemed to have settled into each heart ; some of the mtn wept like; children, others raved out oaths and curses, and one i poor fellow was with difficulty restrained from throw ing himself overboard. The captain sighed heavily, i and muttered to himself, as he thought of his wife, I 'Mv poor Nelly! I am afraid you'll have to struggle alone for braid for our young ones.' During that terrible interval Walter's mind was, for the first time is his life, darkened with blasphemous thoughts ofthe providence of God, the bare remembrance of which ever afterwards made him tremble. Just as he was 

 ' resolving that 'he would never again offer a'prayer for Divine help, a rocket was seen sparkling through the darkness, and then a blue light, and it was at once evident that they had been seen by the watch on board the ship. ' Hurrah ! hurrah ! ' shouted the poor, weather worn men in the boat, as with one voice. 'Lower- down the sails, and out with your oars, my bonnies ! ' cried the captain. That was the only cheerful sentence he had uttered since he had left the wreck. Out went the oars, and the men put all their remaining, strength into their stroke. Guided by the blue light,, the boat was steered a straight course, and soon all hands were safely on board the barque Waterwitch, bound from Sydney to Lima. The weary castawayB were speedily supplied with dry clothing and warm food, and several of the sailors gave up their sleeping bunks to their brother-sailor�, in distresB. Walter and the captain of the Hornet were entertained in the cabin, and the best fare on board, was liberally provided for them. Never, perhaps, is kindness more willingly shown or more keenly appre ciated than under such circumstances. The sudden transition from his wretched plight in the longboat � wet, hungry, heartsick, and death seeming to gape at: him with a thousand mouths, in the rough waveB � to- the well- spread table in the comfortable cabin of the barque, was overpowering, and he could not express his heart's gratitude with his tongue. That rocket, which shot upwards through the midnight darkness always seemed to hiss before his memory's vision, if * he were, in some gloomy moment, tempted to doubt the eternal promise of ' help in every time of ' need.' A few days afterwards a ship was signalled, which proved to be the Janet, whaler, homeward bound t y New Haven. As the provisions were running short oda board the Waterwitch, it was decided to transfer seven of the shipwrecked men tothewhaler. Lots weredrawn.. and Walter was one of the party who were forthwith : transhipped to the Janet, which soon filled away on a~ straight course lor Cape Horn.
