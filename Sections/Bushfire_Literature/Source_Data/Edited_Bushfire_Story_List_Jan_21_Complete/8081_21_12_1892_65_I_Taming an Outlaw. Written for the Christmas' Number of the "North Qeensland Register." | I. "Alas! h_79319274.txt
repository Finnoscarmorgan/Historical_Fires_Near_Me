 of their lives up to date, but until we |iear them speakand watch. their actions, we practically know nothing at all about the people who are intro duced to ns in newspapers or books. But, bless me! it will never do to wastetime arguing iuthis fashion, for here are Miss Alice Lteigh and bier father waiting for an introduction. Wbe.;;\\^ne/'w^;^'::-A_slit�a. Vale, 200 miles back from the coast Mr. 

 lieigb is jnsfcr_ descending from his horse, looking very red m the face, very dusty, and wry angry. 

 Alice Leigb gave asightbut imme diately contr died her feelings, and assumed a pleasant, bat still sympa 

 thetic countenance. Not that Alice 

 could at any time look unpleasant at any rate nobody bad ever seen ber except as an object tobeadmired and loved, for her sweet disposition as well as for her beautiful face and ^orm. . 

 *fiere, father, drink this'-holding out a big tumblerful of lemonade.. * Have youhad some heavy riding ^to^dayF PoorPrince,' she continued, stroking the horse's strong, perspir . ing neck, Hooksasif he wereastired jas yon.' * , 

 This delicate, smoothing stroke of sympathy and flattery (combined with "the longs cool drink of lemonde)-for 

 what male <reature can resist a 

 woman's condolence on bis fatigue after a long day's work -had a trans forming effect on the old matf^ fea tures, though the storm wasn t quite cleared away yet. 

 * Heavy riding, . eh, my dear ? I 

 should- rather think I have. Con found that fellow Williams, and his mob of brumbies 1 ' If they were v ine I'd shoot evfery head of �em. They're as wild as deer, and hot one of them fit for any deeejat, careful man to throwalegover^ * /

 been doing-, father, that you should bother your head about them ? ' Tm sure joa wol^ 

 attending- to, your own stock, without racing aboutafter his.' - 

 Mr. Leigh's eyebrows went up, his ?-eyes-. Qiaened wi<Je, anxl hetried to took as if his daughter had j ro pouaided some idiotic Question that it washardly worth hiswhile to answei\\ 

 ' What have the man's horses been doing, dlice? Why, what they are always doing. Aren't they always where they shouldn't be? Aren't ^hey alisrays running on my side the river, racing about aaawmgsit -cattle, kicking tbeir heels up in the air, eat ing my giass, and trying to make my 

 stock almost as "wild and miserable lookiogas theowd^es't:/ 

 Ubw, Alice Leigh, though nob stfictty speakiuga bash girl, had 

 <�uutiy long enough to kno w, and was calm enough to recol lect, that horses that were miserable looking didn't usually raee about and disturb other stock, but. were too intent on putting \\ on condition to gallop about jriAmg their lieels up in. the air. However, she said' noth ing, being a wise, as well as a good girL ? . 

 Then ]Mh*/laei|gh continued- , 

 * What on earth Williams and that 

 good-for-nothing cub of his -here 

 Alice's coolness threatened to tem 

 porarily forsake her-* are doing half their time bests me. Will ams is getting a bit old like myself, and-can t knock about same as he used to in the old times when we mastered tHe 

 ranges together.' Mr. Leigh's voice quivered slightly here, hut clearing his throat he continued. 'Still, I reckon his son Harry, if he was worth his salt-- Whyr what's the matter girl F You look hot and flushed.' 

 * Oh, it's nothing father,' said Alice, rising and reaching down a . huge Chinese fan. 1 I'm a Utile hot, that's all. If the weather keeps getting hotter like this, I'm sure it will be 

 unbearable at Christmas.' 

 'WelL,mydear, as I. was saying, if Harry W Hiatus had any gritm him,' -gijeat agitation of the fan- he*d^do his utmost to keep hi6 father's horses off other people's property.' 

 * Well, father, to be quitefair, don't you think that Mr. Williams' son 

 does come over this side of the river 

 pretty frequently after the Coulbarra 

 horses?' 1 

 * Tut, tu*, child! What do you. knowof Harry William's visitsto my country after horses F and Mr. Leigh glanced suspiciously at his daughter. 

 .' * Only what I've heard in floating gossip between Jim aud Echo and Judy ^-sometimes a word here, some times there,' replied Alice. * Perhaps 

 there was no truth in their talk.' 

 ' Truth !not a bit of it; nothing but a pack; of lies. r Young Williams is too lazy {fan very active) for anything except to do the swell when he goes to town, lie about the verandah of thehousewith a bookin 

 his hand, or perhaps take a tide out onthe run when the heat of the day is over. Why, God bless me, he was ; too indolent to assist his father to-day. But wait, let me begin at the begins ning, and yon s^all hear the adven tures of the day.' 

 Alice Leigh stopped fanning jher self, andiixed her now calm eyes and face on her father, but she still held the useful, if not ornamental shield 

 W'^tt was about noon when I, Jim and Eeho came acrcssabout thirty head of colts and fillies, aU pretty well WBT brand. . . hey were on that nice patch of green feed at the head of Oakey 

 Creek. 

 * Send the brutes down the creek und over the river,7 I shouted . ' hut there was no need for us to even 

 crack a whip. With a sniff and a snort away they went, their heads up in the air, their tails flying out like 

 streamers in the wind. All we had 

 to do was to keep them together. I 

 feefrt tSclio and Jim to and lett flanks, whilst I kept the reir, as I wafe lietermin&l I would loot leave 

 a hoof .&� WiHiims' >qj|my side ^ 

 liei�h"s fap w<nt Up far a*n instant, and a faint, but l$aiid!yfemile came to her JJfjK whenshe remem bered the, oearo! ^he^lyii^hoEses was 

 the easiest ��S tier good oldf fatter to be in, though lie " meant x> take the lion'js share of credit-if a,jy cteilit was tobe attaehedto the pro-; ^be�iaii^gs-''r7 ~T" "?7-'- '? . 

 W�lI, my jiear,' Mr. Leigh con tinued, - tire ride was a stiff one. I kept the warrigats well together in the rear,andby dint of jelling oat orders, and, ahem! curses to Jim and Echo, we kept theleaders straight over the sandy flat, heading them for the river crossing. Gross ing J the flat was a- caution. The horses threw the dust np in clouds, thougti it is only a we�-jk since a thunderstorm fell the e. Ugh ! I feel as if my throat was fall of fand and grit yet.' 

 Alice took i he hint, an<l poured out 

 another tumblerful of water intc 

 which she squeezed the juice of a 

 le non. 

 ' 1 conid no more s-e the horses than I can see th- canals or lakes in Mars with my naked eye. I kept my whip going, and Jim and Echo took the hint, and the fasilad** was some thing tremendous. I just followed 

 the dust and the thud ! thud! <�f the horses' hoofs. The ��iseand thed��st 

 and now and again a shrill scream or a whin �y fiv�tn * mare or a. colt were all we had a-- guides. How Jim aud the nigger missed getting their brains dashed out is beyond tuy comprehen sion. As for me, A ice, I've not been in the saddle these forty years, for nothing. But my eyes are not so goo! as they used to be, and I shaved seve ral overhanging limbs of trees by only 

 abairsbteadth.' 

 At which words Alice Leigh drew nearer the old man, and placing one arm round his neck, gently scoMed him for running such risks for the sake oi a few head of horses trespass ing on his ran, 

 'Pshaw! my girl! yon know its not f >r. what the horses eat that I-put them. ofiray;.country. 1*1* be even with that scouidrel across the river, even if I do ran the risk of breaking my neck after his worthless rubbish.' 

 We catne to the river bank at last, and aswegot on to hard ground the dost clenred away, and, hang me! if there wasn't a fresh in the river. It 

 mu^t hav^rained up at the head, and there was the water rushing down soihe ten feet deep. But the fresh wasn't �he biggest surprise I got. Right across cm the other; bank was WilliaHip, his lazy scamp of a son, and a couple of niggers. They had some twenty be *d of my cattle, an-1 were actuallyibout to rush them into the river, which wa3 pretfystrong, nearly running a banker.' 

 * Are you quite sure, father, Mr. Harry Williams was assisting his father*to rush yonr cattle into the water f queried Alic^. 

 * iny dear, that'- just the fault 

 I hrtve to find with him-he wasn't assisting his fatherat all. As I was goingto saysome time ago he was too indolent to evengive his father a hand topufcihy ca1 tie across the river. 1 here was old WUliamsgallopmo; about like a madman, and th*> two niggers seemed to be getting into each other's way all the time; while Mr. Harry sat there as still as a monument, leaving the old man and the niggers to do all the work. What sort of a l*d do you call Mm, eh ? A very dutiful eon, isn't 

 he* Bah!' - 

 4 But, jiiy drur father, must children obey their parentsif they are ordered to do wrong. I kno iv yon h�ve -never told me to .dd anything wrong, and never will-will yoanow ?'(a cud?Ue and a kt&sneed itisertionhere). 

 As^U'iii g a very brave and enquir ing 1-iok Miss Leigh continued in slow 

 ? tones 

 . 4 Let us supp >se, father, that Mr. Harry ; WiUiinuR disapproved of his fathers con uctinshifiing your cattle from Couibarra, not to Speak of rush ing f'em into a floodedriver-iww, what *��su'tlaai

 Evi^oilrtiib view of the situation hail not itself befo�e to Mr.

 'MKkSw^* ^tflid the young lady, *sup

 cat.t le into tiie flooded rivfr. 

 ' Bosh I at! bosh ! What interest could Harry Williams have in doing me a good turn j'* 

 Here t he writer must pause for owe 

 second to rem�rk to the discriminating*' reader that if love is blind, as it un doubtedly is, yet parental love is often equally deficient in perceptive power, as the silly question j��st asked by Mr. L igh clea ly indicates. 

 The yon<g lady never answered her father's r&therdelieatequestio.>, though 

 l.have no doubt she could have siied a flood of light in the matter of * icte est' had she been s < minded. 

 No, no,' Mr. Leigh went on, 'Harry Williams is no friend of mine. He thmks too uiach of his confounded old 

 father for that.' Then judging that he was getting somewhat inc msistvut he stopped -hort and plunged into the 

 account of what occurred on the- river bank. * 

 * Of course when 1 saw what Wil liam's game �ag I sang out to Jim and Echo to flog the ho ses mto the water. The " hoi sea had st-opped on the brink of the stream, and the poor frightened wretches didn't half fancy facing the turbulent river. One big 

 yellow bay mare, that Jim tells uae is j ah outlaw that nobody can ride, broke, and n* ither Jim nor Echo could head her; bat as for the others, they had to go, and to tell the truth they breasted 

 the wayes that were rolling dovyq. ^ beautifully.' , - 

 , * And your cattle, father ?4 

 'Oh, Williams got a few of them into the water, but the rest broke and got away. I wonder Williams keeps such a couple of useless niggers.' 

 4 -A_h !' . thought Alice, ' he's leaving Hairy alone anyway.' And again 

 the question of the uselessness of the Couloarra niggers Miss Leigh could have shea , some light had she been 

 so inclined. 

 It was with a rather heavy heart 

 that she took her father's arm and led him aw ay to prepare for dinner, which was now nearly ready. 

 * * . 

 Hardly anything needs to be said to further explain the situation of affairs at Ashton Vale and Oonlbarra. Originally the two runs had been: taken up as one, for no squatter in his senses would have applied for the frontage to only one batik of a water course, but Mr. Williams, who was the original applicant for the lease hold, had, after a few years, got into monetary difficulties, and judging,also that the station was too la-rge for his requirements for many years to come, he decided on parting with the country on the opposite side of the river to Coulbarra, that side being in his opinion the least valuable portion of his run- For a long time he and Mr. Leigh got on well together. Leigh was a man of education, whilst Williams was not; but they had many interests in common, and for Several years everything worked beautifully, WiU%ms t often giving 

 way,, even where hie knew be was 

 right and Leigh was wrong, simply out of the chivalrous idea that he had taken Leigh's money for the station, and heought to mafce Leigh's life on the piace he had bought from him as - coiiwortabi^ as h# WiUiai^ was also inclined to give way on 

 aceonSit of Mr. Leigh being his J superior in the accident of birth and education.; Mow the quarrel first sfarfced w�nM b#e been difficult for eit her of the old men to say. 

 A something light as air-a look - A word tmkmdor wmng-ly faVfn 

 might have-commenced the rupture, and bo:h Mr Leigh and Mr Will�ams 

 immediately 'discovered, that- , 

 Sude words will soon rash in 

 To spread the breach tha*words ^)egiu' 

 l^fjfeigh^ too, fotindout now his 

 neighbor was property rqu^ecl, he *- was equally as bitter aad 

 molent as himself, and lost no opjjpr tuuity of showing his dislike 'for tie 

 mud^ i&e^cafctle of Ashton Vale. ^ _ fleeasion in particular s was xfeinfctftbered lay Mr Leigh. �kjme trifling^ snub or mother* liad been ad ministered to Williamsiby Leigh, and the former was biding his time to repay the offence, lie opportunity came the following week. 'Jueigh nd ja black boy bad been mustering in. some wild desert country adj oing bis mm, and had found a WBT bullock there Leigh, tenting to do bis neighbor a good turn, and forgetting thft quarrel with him, took thebul lock along with his cattle, and as - it ^wasn't much out of his way borne. 

 homestead, intending to drop the bullock at the station yaaxl-_Asit happened Williams waspacing his verandah as Leigh and the blaekboy drew near with the-cattle >' . , 

 1 Good evening, Williams!*' shouted Jjeigh. * I've brought you a bullock I found with mine over there in the spinifex.' 

 Williams jumped round witha bang and a snap-'Can't yer cut the - thing out, Lei*�li ? If yer can't, let the blaekboy do it.' ; ^ 5'^ : ; 

 Then he wheeled round and went inside the house. - v 

 Leigh never forgot this insult, and the memories ot the old times when they struggled and helped each oth^r ; thrbngh the musterings and. floods, 

 and droughts, and- bush fires, were scarcely ever allowed to obtrude. 

 As I'coinmenced so I must close this chapter with a little mobilising. The abolitionof the competitive system, and the introduction of the new order, are going to regenerate the world, ^pj^ding .Ito sop^r--^^ 

 according to many thinkers ? Poverty ; is the cause of nearly all the troubles that afflict humanity, and the com petitive system, whilst the cause of mnr�h wealth, is also the .cause .of nea.rly all the poverty in tlie world; be abolished. iSnch is the argument of the socialists.;; Weili I am not prepared at present to dispute the whble of this arguing but, (to again appeal to the discriminating reader) is it not certain that the major premise is unsound ? 

 '�(iiidt onrfriends Mr Leigh and Mr Williams prove its unreliability ? and ! could almost venture to lay 100 to 1, if of a betfcing turn of mind, that there is not a single reader of this story whoeould not recall numerous instances of lives full of crosses aiul worries-perhaps bis . or her own ^ine^Qd^-Hthje majority ^ ?$iich ^ableis,:are/ ^psaireely even indirectly caused by poveity or by the competi

 No, no, we must lay the blame, for most of onr unhappines* on our own shoulders, and not on the inequality nf riches, as.Pope says,'f > 

 Some ate, and mustlie, greater illiaa teiBBt, 

 More rick, more wise; fent who infers from hence : Thatsuehare happier, shocks all common sense. 

 And yet taewor^d can bemade, and must be made much happier than it is. We need not be social istsin order to bring this about, any wholesale attempt at present to repress indi vidualism will end in disaster, yet the wealthy must be t&ught they hold their wealth only by the people 6 consent, and the geUeral good of the state, and because as yet we are not educated enough, or morally ripe enough for any other system. 

 The time will surely come when the State will take good care there are no such follies-nay sueh crimes as strikes in the land, when there -will be no miserable men and heart Sick women, and hungry little children to bewail the want of employ ment for the bread-winner; when every week in the year, and 'not only iGhristmas, which - is now upon us, will" mean peace on earth, and good "Will to, all.
