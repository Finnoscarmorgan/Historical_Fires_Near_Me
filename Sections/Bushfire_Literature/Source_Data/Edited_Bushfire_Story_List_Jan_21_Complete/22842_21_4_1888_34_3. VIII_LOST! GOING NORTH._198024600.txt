 >\\ here, with fire and fierce drought on her treucs. Insatiable summer oppresses S.re woodlands and sad wildernesses. And faint flocks and herds. (Gordon, A. G.) 

 xuose two months brought summer fairly down upon Hivcrina, and though the soring had boon a late one, perhaps few summers" had eTer set in with fiercer heat; in fact, the oldest identity of N and an oldest identity could not possibly tell a lie or make a mistake even to suit the requirements of fiction� was authoritatively reputed to have said in Sandy Forbes' back parlor, immediately after taking six pints of beer to refresh his memory, that he "never see - hic - sich a scorcher as this 'ere summer are spellin' to be; not ' since - hic - never!" January, despite its two faces, has been pretty constant to tho notion of dropping in simultaneously with the new year� a notion which usage and precedent have established as a right ; and if tho other months possess any reasonable grounds for disputing that right tbey must bo too well satisfied with their respective places to interfere, for thongh we road that on ouo distant occasion, the jealous Augustus, beiug piqued because Cajsar'e month contained mora days than his, equalized matters by robbing February, there is no record of January's right over having been enroached upon, Tho year 18-had its January the samo as any other year� that is any other year pos. sossing the least protonsions to respectability� 

 and a funny old January roaster! Phew! the oldest ido-ptJ 1 o5 from sheer exhaustion, and(W�� t1' that any should impute fcr word o- d- fr'1 tbedow of a doubt about th� s'�'s-.-, t ' man in his position) he ro ? bis last gasp, and declared that h� sich a Janooary as this P never. - sate- Ai o o clock on the zcGmlng of l-? Rii, , the month, just as the leaden strei a s! began to touch Wangaratta from over the \\1m Cobb and Co. s coach left the coufiaa of? I townsh.p on its long northward j earner. ft Morton leaned back from his plao� on th� t seat, and called through the coach window 'Frank! Mrss Stretch! If you will �. oni for a few imnutes, you will see the redd " sun yon ever gazed upon !'' Hereupon, two heads were thntst out fr -, behind the leathern curtains of the converse., and two expectant pair of eves were eagerly towards the east. This 'ere, ' said the coachman, ?- approving smile called forth bv the wiaeii, expression of Miss Stretch's face, "This 'ers day, Miss, is goin' fo be a hot 'en. We'v� U havin' a week on. it, Miss, and if this rijq knows any thin' ov astronermv (and lou-htir know a bit, 'cans- I've travelled the roafafh on twelve years) that 'err flamin' sua mesas's hout an' hont frizzier, an' no mistake." At 6 o'clock Rose Devine knocked bedh twice at her father's door : "Come, Mr. Devine! Do von know its time? It's after 6, and that tub of bulla has to be lowered into the river, or it'll Ian to gravy. The thermometer stands at 95 ds�. already; and, my goodness, I don't know wist it'll rise to before noon, if it keeps on goic tp at the present rate ; it reached 103 dee. v; day." " " ' " That's nothing, my dear," replied Ms. tin when I was inspecting a property on lis Mnrrumbidgee, just before I bought Venango, billy, the thermometer rose one day to 125 d;>, in the shade, and when we pat it out in tltsa by way of experiment, I'm blessed if the met. cury didn't ran up and burst the top o! lis tube before you could have said ' Jack Robin- sou ' I slept till 8 o'clock on the mprnkz of that day. " - However, Martin got up, and pat the batter down in the water. He took his coat on to in it, and 48 solid hours went by before he pat it on again. At 8 ; o'clock Doctor Frayne came to break fast in a silk coat with other garments to match, and Mr. Morton, as they shook hands, remarked ; Our friends will have a nasty day for their journey, doctor. Leo is used to'a hot climate, and won't mind it much ; bat his two tit; friends will get rather a warm reception to the back country, eh ?'' . At 9 o'clock, all the live stock, sheep, cattle, horses, and the marsupials, began to draw o5 their pastures, and to prostrate themselves in the shadows beneath the trees, the leaves of which began to droop languidly as if iheii stems lacked strength to bear them up. Tbi birds, too, which at early morning had Bitted blithely through the air," were now inert aal tardy on the wing, as they sought oat cluster ing boskets wherein to pass the oppressive hours, which crept with gathering heat apoj them. At 10 o'clock, Mrs. King, solemnly warning everybody that she could not possibly endure existence till . midday, fold on the housemaid, to- sprinkle "with water the floor : of her room, and to fan her. gently into the next world, which duty the housemaid set about with.a pleasing solemnity, mcch comforting her mistress by the assurance that,: if a change did not set in, ' iermorrer 'd be a real spanker, my word !'' About the same hour, too, Jack, the TYysloag stockrider, dismounted from bis horse at a spring in the bullock paddock, and, after fortifying the crown of his head by cramming a handful of wetted leaves into his cabbage- tree hat, looked to his horse for concurrence in the statement, "this 'ere day's a cork.;." Eleven o'clock, 12 ; and then the whole country-side lay panting and faint, in helpless prostration beneath the fierce fires of the summer's sun. All across the shelterless plains, the hot air quivered like a sea of molten glass ; not a spark of life mingled in the no- broken sheet of parched and sapless herbage, on these baked reaches of thirsty soil, where the earth cracks widened into fissures gaping for I drop of moisture. Yet- not here alone, " with fire, and fierce drought on her trcssos," summer scorched up the life which spring had left behind her; for through the leaty forest, over the unprotected , hills, doica into the valloy depths, the hungry sun rays wormed, like tongues of, fire, licking up the vital juices of herbs and animals alike. Aoa, if, by reason of their strength, these last slaved off the demon from the wells of life, the strugg" mast needs have been severe, the victory aa irksome one to those faint and exhausted flocks, and birds that clung with sickly languor to the wilteddrought-smitten branches. Mb�1 the sun at midway reached tho climax of m power, a tired silence grew upon the laud, sal not a sound disturbed the sweltering stillness but the hiss of gum-lcaves blistering in tol fiery breath ol noon. Nature seemc.1 set m desperate silence to wrestle with her foe, and even the tepid water of the mountain stream appeared too weary to bubble, as � swooned along between its parched banks. On such a day, to be alone and thirsty-'' in the waterless bush ! Next to an open, shelterless plain, there is no place where t pitiless fangs of such a summer's day � fasten on a man with more deadly uercen ' than in the heart of a bastard malleo ! icra The pitiless rays beat down where no s baJi offer resistauco to their cruel force, and, wo tho stunted bushes do not cover, the grs� � earth like heated pottery throws off a sudor glare. , � On the day in qncstion, in tho centre ot immense tract of this desert conutry, wnie 7 at tho back of Kolkibertoo and about "�c'u miles to the west of the homestead, a wo jji drooping figqre plodded along the c�ttrs� ,w wire fence, which ran through tho m scrub. His motions were feeble and uncc' and ho had evidently reached the last stag , exhaustion; yot hope is strong within ' i life is a hard thing to givo up, 60 tin struggled on with sunken cheeks, and ,. oycB, and lips that were cracked and bl S for want of moisture. Judging by the fig" swag he carried and his clothing, 11 . b. laboring man� a drovers shopberd P for tho dog which trotted wearily at was of tho collio breed.

It won't do to give in 1 Ob, my God 1 how the sun beats down 1 Dark y, poor fellow, could only wag his tail, tutthcro never was a promise or a vow of hnuian tongue that spoke a stancher purpose than those mild but faithful eyes : " I will not leave thee, master ; north or south, go on ; go cn: I will not leavo thee 1 " And ou they went� struggled on with blis tered feet and waning strength, till the head Vtcw dizzy and tho heart grew sick with con- ic unl-tiug the hopeless reach of bronze-bued 'bu'-hos all around. One mile two ; and then, tripping slightly on a straggling weed, the traveller staggered forward and fell heavily to the ground. A few low moans, and tho limp ibor'y 'drew itself into a sitting posture ; then : the head foil slightly forward, tho lips bled "iree'y smearing the beard with red-hucd ; stains; and the eyes, half-hidden by their drooping lids, were grim and grey. with shadows j-ef hovering death. The dog crouched closer to f it3 master's side, looking up with it's wistful, Ya<l eyes into that master's face, and licked the 'hand which dropped beside him : "I will not ''leave thee, master ; not in death itself I " i But the dogged spirit, which hod straggled -en until tho body fell' upon ils track, was not 1 to wily conquered at the last; it revived at 'the soothing" touch of that faithful tongue. 'With a heavy sigh the man looked up. s ' \\h God, is this to be the oud ? Havo 1 endured the bitterness, the woes of life � i fought, and grappled, and Eiuned, to die like a 'faini'hcd dingo, uumourned and alone in this strange land of drouth and fire?

Two tears trickled down Ihe'swagman'a face |ns he laid his hand softly 'on the rough coat of tins companion. . - |i -- I'd like to live old boy, if it were only to I'.eed and water you once" more. I felt like g.dving a few minutes back, but since I've been |iit!iog hero I'm stronger ;' tho rest has done 1 me good, and I believe I could Inst tho night fthrongh yet, if I saw any hope of attracting |aiJ.

But that won't answer in my |-rasc, because everything in so parched and dry |.lliat tho lire would get miles away from mo |fccfae anyoae could reach it ; besides, tlie additional heat would kill mo right off � would i|it though I wonder?" And the man started to hiB knees trembling like an aspen at tho more IT thought of apcssible rescne. I'll try it I he jsaid; "I doa't too that it matters much whether 1 die quickly by heat or linger ou |�;to succumb to thirst." | lie took a match from his pocket, struck it \\ Jn his hoot, aud thrust it iuto a tuft of spini- 3.tex or porcupine grass. Tho parched and j| fap.ess herbago hurst iuto flames like tinder, vinJin ten minutes the air was black with |nuoKe, aud eliding with heat and gases. | At three o'clock Jack, returning from his .'.round in the bullock paddock, pulled his jaded horse shcrt up.upona piece of low-lyiug grouud, ft? i, b'3 nostrils as a spaniel might I btl lor an uncertain scent. :j '.'Au'?

Well, I wax lost myself once, and may be the cove's hard pushed aud couldn't help liissclf ; so I'll run im down and chance the ducks." At lialf-past 4, jack was dismounted again, 4 miles up the fence, supporting iii a silting posture the limp and faiuting figure of the lost J01111, After lighting Hie fire, the already weak traveller had gradually sunk uudcr ils sickening, heat, and Jack had found him on a bare piece of I grouud, around which tho fire had burnt, in a swoon from which he would never have re covered without assistance. The stock rider's first action was to tear from his saddle the half empty water bag and to npply it to the other's lips. These ho just moistened, and then, by damping the forehead and fanning with his hat, he quickly produced signs, of animation. : As soon as the swagman brcatheil freely and the light of t intelligence began to flicker in his eyes, Jack ponrcd half the supply , of water into his mouth, and made him swallow. Though tho liquid was warm, it had a wonderfully reviving effect, and the man immediately moved his lips aud made sigus of� wishing to speak. . The stock rider bent his grizzly head low, but failed to under stand the husky whispers of the other. "Alright old hoss !" ho said, "I'll put you straight in no time ! Jest you. pluck up now, and I'll have you fixed in a good bunk .with hoggins o' tea and tucker, afore yer ken say < jolly 1 Hold 'ard now ; dent go for to yabba afore ycr able ! Never mind talkin' for a bit! Here now, tnko some more o' this 'ere water ; it'll jist set yer up !" Bet the prostrate man turned his head aside, and made another desperate attempt to articu late. Jack leaned forward in a listening atti tude, but as " his ears caught the words addressed, to him, he satnp and opened his eyes in blauk amazement. " Well I'm Mowed !" Then he bent his gaze once more in. the swagman's facer as though seeking thero sbnio explanation of thelatter's whispered words. - " Look 'ere mate," ho: continued, ' " You want. this 'ere water a darned sight, more'n yer dog dees; he ken reach the river without it, and yon k'ant, so jist awaller it will yer 1" But tho man still refused, and Jack was forced to compromise matters by dividing tho remaiuing liquid , between", tho dog. and its master. . " Hung me mate, ifyon.mnt a raro plucked 'un, an' no mistake. I shyed some 'ard things agin ycr a while back, but the chap as 'ud do this 'ere by liis dog, aint goin' fer to set the bush afire, till he's pushed to it. Ycr a hout un' hout plucked 'un, that's what you arc, an' I'll pull y. or through this bizlucss if I has to carry, yer on liiy back from hero to Wyalong." So saying,' Jack assisted the. weak niati on to Boc'o's baek, mid, steadying him' iii tho saddle with his right hand, leading the horse with the loft, proceeded townrds the.Murray. At 5 o'clock Martm Dcviuc ancl ltoso stood at the door of the punt store," trying' to make out whore thc.busli tire was. The smoke-laden air and odors of burnt- leaves had : long since warned them that thero tens a fire, but their low position and tho tall gums which sur rounded them, prevented their discovering the precise quarter from whenco the smoke pro ceeded. " It 1b somewhere on the north side of the river, Rose," said Martin, after looking around for several minutes; "because the smoke is drifting in a. southerly direction; but whether it is ou CockeldjcgoDg or at tho back of ICol- kibertoo I cau't make out. Well, if tho wind should not change its direction or should rise during the night, I'll bet two straws and a bit of dirt that everybody in N-i� will know where the fire is at raid-day to-morrow. The whole country, is just ripe for a fire ; every thing is lika tinder, nud mark my words, to morrow will he a bad day for somo of us." At six o'clock, Cobb and Co.'s conch pulled up at tho punt store, and tho three passengers from Melbourno alighted therefrom. After' ranch shaking of hands with Martin and Rose, who at first sight hardly recognised liiiu in his city get up uud clusa cropped liair, Leo escorted Mies Si retrli actors the river, and saw her safely started for Koikibertoo in Mr. King's buggy, which was Waiting. Then he rccrossed, aud, witli his fvicud Fruuk, took possession or Mr. Morton's buggy, which had also been sent to meet the coach. : : : ' ' You luuiugeT to cliooso a bad day, for your journey, Mr. Loo," said Martin just beloro they drove off, "It has been a terror, has it not ? My friend here and his lndy cousin lmvo had a treat in the syay of bush travelling, I can tell yon. I have been consoling tliem iu their misery, by pre dicting a beautiful day to-morrow." - ."Humph! TVcll,"l liopc your predictions will prove true." But there was not.muqli proiuiso in tho look he cast towards the sun set.
