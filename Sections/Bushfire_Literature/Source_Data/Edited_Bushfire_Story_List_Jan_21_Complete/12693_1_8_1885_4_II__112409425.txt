The Viking's Rock.\
CHAPTER II,\
Life rau very uneventfully at Haroldsdene. The house stood in several acres of its own grounds. A large belt of fir trees stretched away at the back. Iu front, as far as tho eye oould reach, was nothing but wild, rock bound coast, and illimitable expanse of water. The inmates had but few neigh bours, and those at considerable distance. There was a little fishing hamlet some two miles down tho coast; but this only consis ted of a few cottages, inhabited by fisher men and their families.\
The gaieties at Haroldsdene were confined to a stately dinner-party once a year, and one or two garden-parties in tho summer: tut Hyacinth did not find it dull: she had never been acoustomed to gaiety, and did not miss it. She had her horse and her dog, her birds and her flowers; she was very fond of Lady Flavelle; and she was grateful to Sir Albert, though she did not fuel tho same amount of affection for him that she did for his wife.\
She had a fair fortune of her own, left her by her father, so she felt none of tho bitternoss of dependence. She had been quietly, tranquilly happy beforo Sydney's * return j but sinoo that return she found a\
fuller enjoyment in life than she had any\
idea of beforo.\
There were so many things he could teach her that Adrian had never troubled his head about. He seemed alike at home on sea or land. Ho taught her rowing and Bwimming. Ho explained to her the secrets of the ocean. He told her of the vast coral reefs and banks of madreporo that wore bo mysteriously raised by the tinyooral insects. He told her what a glorious sight it was to see the beauties of the ooral world boneath the transparent waves\'97of tlie beauty and variety of the colours\'97how in one place all the branches were of a bright apple-green; in another, a large Bhrubbi ry of the same stony plants would b6 all light brown or pale yellow; others, again, of a delioate pale blue, deep rose p?nk or pale salmon oolour. He told her that the beauty and variety of the forms oould never be exaggerated, hardly even described\'97how they varied from the branches that most of us are familiar with to the most delicate lace-work, that looked as though it were the work of fairy fingers. He told her how he bad been struck the first time he saw a coral reef\'97how new and apparently unreal the whole thing was,^ to Bee clear green water rolling and sparkling over what looked like flowers, and to see the shapes and colours of flowers produoed by what he knew to bo stone; or most peculiar of all, to see form and symmetry, and almost the regularity of architecture, beneath the water, in place of rugged rocks were certainly novel and unusual sights.\
Hyaointh wouldlisten with rapt attention, lying back in the boat, that was gently rocking on the waves, and would imagine she could see the wonderful sea-flowers he spoke of.\
\'95 At other times ho would tell her of the terrible bush-fires aud the devastation they 'caused, sometimes whole families perishing ih the flames, besides troops of cattle aud flocks of sheep, and how they were often caused by the carlessness of " sundowners" dropping the ashes from their pipes in the dry grass and scrub.\
1 Again he would tell her of the wonder land of New Zealand\'97of the geysers, of the natural hot basins and cold basins, tier above tier, where the Maories would spend hours, ohin-deep iu the clear water, smok ing their short pipes the while.\
He would tell her of the Australian din goes, and the devastation they caused among ,sheep,by day looking so meek and mild that no one would believe a single dog had been known to kill thirty sheep in a night\'97of the Kangaroo hunts and drives, and of the treacherous black fellows, the Australian Aborigines, for whom one was obliged to keep a sharp look-ont when travelling in\
the bush.\
He told her with what strange sensations he eat his first Christmas pudding under a broiling suu, how everything seemed to be .topsy-turvy, and many other of his experien\
ces.\
It was so delightful to Hyacinth; it opened out a new world to her, a world of fairyland, she who had never left England's\
' ahoreB.\
She would listen for hours; and when he thought he had tired or wea ried, her,. she would beg him to tell her\
more.,\
? Adrian did not half like the preference wbioh Hyacinth so plainly showed lor\
Sydney's sooicly; but as the lattor never out-stepped the bounds of botherly friendli ness, and always insisted upon Adrian form ing one of the party on tlio numerous ex peditions ho organised for hor amusement, lie did not well seo how he could iutor foro.\
Hyacintli was so young and unworldly, sho loved him, of course ; but Sydney out tertaiued and amused hor a great deal moro tliau he had ovor triod to do : ho was obliged to own that to himself, and also that tho brother ho was prepared to despise was in many respects superior to himself. Ho seemed to havo quite givon over his boyish follies, which wero indeed moro the wildness of youth than serious faults, and had de veloped iiuo a generous, thoughtful man. j Even Sir Albert congratulated himself\
upon tho happy oliango thftt had taken place in his s.capograeo son, and plumed himself upon the thought that had it uot been for his timely so verity, tho chaugo would never lmvo cccu?red.\
But it was Lady Flavello who rojoioed tho most. Though sho would nover ac knowledge it to anybody, yot dcop down in her heart she know that sho lovod her youngest son tho best; and it had boon so many dagger-thrusts to that loving heart | when she had heard overbody agree that he would never oome to good,\
So the days rolled quickly by; and to one I at loast of tho inmates of Haroldsdeno they were days of unalloyed delight. Hyacinth had just begun to live: before sho had been existing; but now she knew what life meant. : Sho never thought that naturo could bo so\
beautiful: she looked at it with awakened\
eyes, and it was Sydney who had opened\
them,\
She never thought of whevo sho was I drifting : she only know that life seemed I fairer than it had ever been beforo. Instead\
of one young companion, sho had two ; and she thought that accounted forher incroased happiness.\
As the months passed, she never noticed that Adrian seemed gloomy and abstracted, ! and that ho left her more to Sydney's com panionship. Tho latter noticed it, however, and triod by overy means in his power to draw Adrian back to his betrothed's side. He imagined perhaps it was some slight ! jealousy of himself; aud ho thought by ab\
senting himself a little, Adrian would como\
[ back to Hyacinth but though ho put\
[ this design into execution, it had not the\
desired effect, for on his return Hyacinth guilelessly told him she had been so very lonely, for Adrian had been away nearly every day, and sho hail no oue to. take her\
for her rows and rambles.\
Sydney was pazzlod. What could it mean ? II was evidently something be sides jealousy of himself that caused Adrian's frequent absencos; but what it was ho could not decide, so ho gave up puzzling, and settled down into his brotherly rote again, thinking that all would oomo right in the end.\
Not far from the Viking's Kock was a curious cave, hollowed out in the cliff. It extended for some distanoo inland, aud was known by tho name of tho Viking's Gave. A hole in a field above tho cliff leading to a sort of tunnel was tho only moclo of entrance from tho land;' but from the sea a boat could easily float for some way into the in terior. The sides of tho Cuvo wore coverod with stalactites of tho most extraordinary and fantastic forms, somo - appearing like frozen fountains, others like marble pillars, others, again, like huge icicles. The water ran along a broad channol, and seemed to lose itself in the dark recesses of the in terior. Tho light entered only for a very short distance. People visitingthe Cave had to provide themselves with lights. In the still twilight of a summer's evening bats would sweep down with a shadowy flight, giving an eerie look to the place.\
The water was popularly supposed to be very deep there. When it was calm it would ripple along the sides with a musi cal plash and murmur; but in rough weather the waves, would come reverberating in with a noise like thunder, dashing the spray up the foam-flecked sides of tho Cavern, that seemed to give the noisy revellers a dark welcome. During storms massses of sea weed had been forced in, and were scattered about, some of it even having reached the roof. Sea-birds had been often driven in by stress of weather.\
It was a place that had a great attraction for Hyacinth. She would often coax Syd ney to row her to it. She could let her imagination have free play there. She would fancy that she was in a subterranean creek, six hundred feet under ground, like those that Sydney had told her about. She would people it with the shadowy wraiths of dead-and-gono Vikings, one of whom was still supposed to haunt the Cav ern and the Rock.\
It was said that sometimes in a storm a white shadowy form would be seen on the highest pinnacle of the Bock, wringing its hands in despair, and hardly to be distin guished from the white sea-foam ; at other times it would be seen riding on the crest of a moustrous billow, that would disappear within the recesses of the cavern. It was said to bode misfortune when it appeared. The superstitious fishermen declared that is bad never appeared but some terrible mis fortune always followed. If there was a report that it had been seen, there was not one of them, stalwart men as they were, who would put to sea in the same week. Had not the whole fishing fleet been lost the last time of its appearance ? and why should they recklessly throw away their lives, after being warned 1 It was useless to argue with them: nothing would shake their faith in the Viking's Wraith.\
