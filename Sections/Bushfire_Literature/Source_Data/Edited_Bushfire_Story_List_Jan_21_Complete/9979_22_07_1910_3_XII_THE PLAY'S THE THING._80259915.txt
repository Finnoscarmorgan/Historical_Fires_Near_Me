 CHAPTER XII. 

 THE PLAY'S THE THING. I 

 The curtain rose. The house ap 

 I plauded. Peler and Polly &hd Till* I utrained their necks to get a Cull v)�*' I of the opening scene. > The' home l of a poor selector was dlscldftod. 

 burning lamp stood on the table Be 

 neath tiie open window stood .a' bucket of water. Through the win dow glared a bush fire that was raging outside. The old selector (Tom Broggs by the programme) wag seated tit the flre-placc, Bad and deepondent-looltlnc- . 

 "Oh, ian't It real!" Polly gasped. "A selection!" Tilly answered, 

 The selector's wife (Mrs Broggs Miss Vlrla Delback, tho programme. Announced) entered with a pair ot 

 men's pants that wanted repairing,, hanging over her arm, and gazed silently about the soaht* shelving tn search of something. 

 "Ha! Ha! Ha!" Peter broke out. aud was promptly suppressed by Tills 

 and Junes. 

 "I had a needle1 to-diy,-somewhere," Mrs. BroggB said In a rlear voice, "whatever on earth I could have done with it." 

 She went on ransacking the* shelv ing. 

 "That's jiiFt labke ' what ye're Moot her would do," old John whisper* ed hoarsely to bis falsify 

 The groat audience watched Mrs. Broggs with Intense ellonce. She looked around, and discovering the eld selector (her husband) seated ploornily. at thff fireplace. fmptOBChed h!m and placed a band lightly on his �hould�r. 

 "Ah, don't brood /Over, it eo much, rather!" she said lb touching tones. "I know it's very hard and disheart ening after all your years of work and waiting, to see the fences and crops burnt like that. Gut you did all you could to fight it, and the boys find the two girls are still doing their best with it! Thank God. you were sble to cave the house, so'don't take It to heart any more, Father. It will surely "come right in the end everything does, if you tootles.*' ' 

 Then looking round and assuming a cheerful tone: "Besides, we haven't heard from the storekeeper yet about the corn. You nevetf .can tell what-it might fetch, or how well off we shall be yet. Do you kuow, I've been for days watching for. the mailman to bring a letter, and .�o?ne thing tells me there's one not far oft/1 

 "Oh. Isn't she good!" Tilly uald to 

 Polly. 

 Without raising his head selector Broggte dragged a letter from Lis pocket and handed It to hU wito. 

 "The mailman come when I was 

 fighting the flrex Ellen," he said In a rough, sorrowful voice. 

 Mrs. Broggs took th'e letter and read aloud for the benefit of the audience: "Twelve pounds your maize brought. I have accordingly credited your account with this amount, which now leaves a balance of �3 owing." A heavy sigh came from. Mrs. Broggs, and letting fall the letter she sank In a lifeless ,aort of way beBlde her husband Mid hid her face In her hands. 

 "Poor thine!" Polly murmured. 

 "Isn't It like a lot of casefll" Tilly said sadly. 

 ' "Go on the land, yolunc piaal" a voice In the gallery called out, and the great audience began to laugh In spite of Itself. 

 Here a quaint-looking selection boy whom the nroeramme set forth as "Sam, youngest eon of old 

 Rroggs," limped on ID an Indifferent eort ol war. 

 The audience greeted als nrnt.il wlUi merriment, and Petor crlel: 

 'Hal Ha! Ha! Ain't lie lfkc Ted Tomkios?" 

 "Mke the boy ^ Myrtlea/'* Polly 

 said, smiling. 

 "That's the cove I meant," Peter yelled. ''Ha! Ha! Ha!" 

 "Take it easy, old chap," *ft mail sitting behjnd said to Petal, 'take ft easy." ' 

 Sam Broggs stared through the window ex the alleged fire and stut tered: 

 "Oh-hoV They're all kuk-kuk comln' In ergairi from It They kuk kuk-couldn*t_best it. Oh-hah! L-L L-L-ook at her bub-bub-buraln' th* Block-yard. Gee wluke, th-that'd be th* place tut-to coo-ooo-cook bread, 

 mum." 

 "Cook bread! Ha! Ha! Ha!" Peter roared. "Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh crikey." 

 "Shut up!" the man beblnd Peter said, and James growled a warning to behave himself Into Peter!v ear. 

 Old Broggs rose trtitti his despond ency and position, and struggling wlUi his emotion, said to Bain: 

 "What was that you said, my 

 bov?" 

 Mrs. Broggs also rose and m&ae an effort to put a cheerful- face on things. * 

 "Hoh g-g-gce winkle," Sato ans wered, "wnere '11 y-y-you milk th* kuk-knli-cowfl now, Father?" 

 Some of the audience thought It Necessary U> laugh. And some regard ed the moment as premature. Those who thought it premature cried "Silence!" * 

 Peter was one of those who thought it necessary to laugh. 

 Other members of the selector's family trooped on. They were Dan Mroggs 'ana- Dave Broggs, an! were accompanied by an ancient and asthmatic uncle. Bach of them cur ried fragments of the green houghs they bad -used to belt the fire with. Their entrance was the signal for loud applause and mirth, and Peter, at the top,of. his voice, cried: 

 "Oh, crikey, leather, ain't that old 

 Uokc like Christie Slater?" I 

 The new characters threw down their worn-out boughs, and sighed "Christopher*' and "Laws!" in the tame breath. Then \\\\ turn they dipped into the water Wcket and 

 drank like camels. 

 "I could drink a river dry," Dave Brcggu drawled. 

 "I could drink one blocsnlng well full." Dan Broggs declared.. 

 "Ha! Ha! Ha!"'Peter yelled' at this. "That was good, Father, be could drink U full.** 

 "Shut up and give the, cove on the etage a chance." growled the man sitting behind Peter. 

 J&meg dug Peter hard in the ribs. fcut^Peter had no feriing. His eyes and mind were all on the perform 

 ance. 

 "Do you know, ray dress caught fire again, Mother." Sarah Brogga said, displaying the charred parts of 

 her garment as she walked about tbo 

 etagc. . 

 Mrs. Broggs threw up her hands , as though about to collapse,. and ex 

 claimed: 

 | ""Oh, my goodness! my gracious, child, you might have tnet with yovr 

 death!" 

 I "My word, Santfi got Into a tigb* 1 place, Mother/' said Dan Brogga "and 

 It took mo All my time to put her | out. I was the only one ot tUe crowd I near her." 

 | "Oh dear, oh dear, children!" and | Mrs. Broggs showed further aymp 

 | torn5 of going off. As an after 

 thought, however, sho suddenly rat 

 | lied and asked In a surprised voice: I "But where was your sister?" 

 "Who, Kate, Mother?" and Sarah UroggB grinned and made faces that 

 stirred the risible faeuties of tbe I audience -again. "Why,, she was with Jim Mackenzie, of course, he xvas 

 I giving UB a hand, you know, or-er 

 giving Kate his hand." She grimac 

 ed again And disturbed the peaceful I atmosphere of the audience once ! 

 more. 

 "Oh, she's simply splendid!" Tilly affirmed. And Peter laughed and rolled about In his seat .until the man behind trim touched him on the shoulder and said: "Be careful, old chap." 

 "But you're sure you're not burnt, my girl?" Mra. Broggs west on with much concern. � 

 "Oh, you couldn't bum me, Moth er," Sarah. BrOggs answered. 

 "No you couldn't, Motbor," Dan Broggs tidded, helping hlrn^lf to j another drink. "She's too green I to burn." 

 I Aid the laughter that greeted Dan's I observation was something to remem 

 ber. It nearly proved fatal to Peter. ."Did you hear that, Father?" he yelled to old John, "lShe was too greon to burn.* Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!,Ha! HaJi-h-h! Oh Laws!" 

 "Say mate," said (he individual at Peter'a back, "I'd like to syndicate tbflt smile of yours." 

 Tilly and James overheard the rude observation, and they both glanced sideways at Peter, and laugh ed on their own account. 

 * "Dut poor Uncle," Sarah Bropga ran on, directing sympathy to hpr dilapidated relative, "did get a nasty burn! Such an u?ly senr! (plnr ine her band llchtly upon the ^aare crow's shirt collar she proceeded to show the wound). A burning l�m�> Ml on him, and a red hot coa! slid rlsrht down his neck. (The Undo crouched and film-hod from the touch of her hand.) Just look at it! (Uncle let off a yell jvhich made those on the staare and those off U rrar with merriment)" 

 I don t see, the ttfccV cried, "whet ver've pot ter lauph at!" 

 The audience laue-hed wore. 

 Dan and Have Rroees Bp->lorfepd to their relative for matins light c.f 

 bta trouble. 

 The old Uncle, growling to hlm� Belt, lifted the bucket tp his head, AUd started drinking like a iiorsc. 

 "Look out, old chap," a gruff vole* in the audience called out, "or you'll be kicking the backet soon." 

 I "Ha! Ha! Ha!" cried Peter. 

 "Hoh! HobHoh!' ' roaril old 

 John, and added: "An* be looks an 

 if he'll kick th' boocket ralit eioot" 

 I The Unclc set the bucket on the | floor, wrong end up, and 

 seating himself on It, proceeded to feel bis sore neck. 

 Peter almost lost control of lilm* Belf. "Frther," he shouted, "ain't he & funny beggar!" 

 "It must be very painful to yon. I'm sure, Uacle," Mrs. Broggs said I sympathetically. "Won't you lot me put something on it-a little I sweet oil?" 

 , "Oil's 110 use to it." old selector iBrogga put In, addressing his dis 

 tressed brother, "you put a fistful of 

 j flour on it-that'll bring th* beat out i of Jt in no time (turning to Mr* 

 I Brofcgs.) Get me a pinch o' flour, I Mother, I'll put it on for him." 

 | Mrs. Broggs shook her bear sor 

 rowfully, and said: 

 I "Tbere Isn't a bit In t&' house, 

 , Father-till fcome comes!" 

 Some of the audience murmured: "Poor things!" 

 "If tbere were," the Uncle growl ed Jn protest, "I wouldn't let htm put it on. I'd w&nt chloroform first." 

 "Good man," sliouted some one ID the pit, and a�aln the great audience were provoked Into merriment. 

 "Now run away, dear, and changc your dress," the mother saJd to Sarab Broggs. Then remarking the flb sence of tbe other daughter, fihe Ask ed: "But, where Is yoor sister?' 

 "Out talking to Jim Mackenzie, of course." Sarah Broggs replied. "They'll be la directly. Mother." 

 "A fat Jot of p-p-puttln' out th" Are they d-d-dld," Sam Braggs said. "I knows liow they'd do It, hangla' r-r round each other's n-n-nedcs." 

 Mrs. Broggs here called the precoc ious Sam to order and Sarah Broggs reminded him that he knew fir too much for a little boy. 

 Sam made faces at them which plea ted the audience, 

 "Well, anyhow, Mother," the old selector Interposed in dramatlc_tpnes, "sweetheortlM' In this way ain't tv thine for a gal o' mine. Outside > ain't no place for 1^ It werpn't tlf way them things wer* done In my 

 time." 

 "Oh, they'll be In a moment, Fath er," Mrs Broggs answered contilllat Ingly. "Theer's no need to be angry Jim la a decent young man." 

 "That's all right enough," roared the selector, "be might be a decent young niart. But he's on'y flesH ni' blood like anyone else, and this out side business ain't the right thing leastwayB it -ain't In my eyes." 

 The (radiance were is a frivolous mood, and enjoyed the old selector's Ideas of the wrong way to contact a 

 courtship. 

 Dan Broggg and Dare, Sarah and the asthmatic Uncle withdrew, while old selector Broggs moved to the ojtn window and {rated out Into the night. 

 "Tears o' work gona In a dart", be' to toned. 

 Mrs Broggg showed great eoasflrn for the mind of her husband. 

 "Don't worry any more about It Father!" she pleaded. "Remember we have got our health and our strength left, and what we did tutor* ?we can do again!" 1 

 The old selector tamed aal (nek Ills wife's band. 

 "TJiat'B right spokefl, Milan,* he 

 eald. "You were always a brave woman. We have our health, Anil vie have our strength-and we have fought fires before, and floods, and droughts, and debts, and eneanLes, and what we have done before we can dt> again-anil will do." 

 A great cheer came from the onCf once. Old John squeezed a tear from hi? eye and whispered to PjU.v: "Ah moost breng your Moother an' Granny to see this!" 1 t 

 There was a loud knocking at the <loor of the selection home, and a Jmrly sandy-bearded Scotchman named McCIure, arrayed In shabby, tattered hilts, and accompanied by hie wife, a thin, spare woman, entevefl, to the surprise of old BroggB nnfi Mrs J'roggs. They all greeted �>R5h other, end old Broggs offered then a sett 

 "We canna s!t," McCIure said, "we're baith salr wl' hurry. Ha ye Been a' that's put In th' paper liboot 

 vourfier?'* 

 Old Broggs Blared and said be had n't seen the paper for a month. 

 "It's right I)rood o' � e we are," Mc Clure proceeded, While' hifl wife 

 6mlled and nodded her endorsement. 'We're prood o' ye, Meester Tarn Btoggs, Justice o' th' Peace." 

 "My Tom?" old Broggs gasped. 

 "AT, an' gi' us ye're baun'," 6ald MoClure. "I oongraitulate balth o* yc." 

 They all shook, while the audience fowled and laughed. 

 "Well, I can hardly believe it," said old BroBgs. excitedly. 

 The burly Scot produced a news- ; liaper as evidence. 

 "Old Johnson the member, must have dona that," the selector said, thinking hard. 

 - "Ay!" replied MoClure. "seeln' that j you've always been against him with your family votes why would he 

 "By Jove! gasped old BroggB. 

 "An' o' course ye'll ha' tae gl' hlni your rupport from now till the day o' Judgment: ye cfljina help your sel'," McClure went on. 

 '-Thnt'3 the way they get all th9 damccrats to go over," a voice from the gallery yelled, and the audience burst Into laughter, cheers, and hoots. 

 "Ye'll- be spoke aboot an' meentlon od a' owor the country," Mrs McClnre assured them. " 

 "Just like Bobby Burns," aided McClure. 

 "Who's he?" Innocently Inquired old Broggs. 

 "What men!" cried McClure. "hae ye never Hfcerd tell o' Bobby Biupns? Do ye no ken his poems an' gangs?" 

 Old Broegs Bhook hie head. 

 Here Don Broegs, who with Dave Broegs and Sarah BroggB aad the bat tered Uncle had returned to the stage with their facetf washed, spoke and snld: "I think I heard tell or that cove somewhere when you come 

 to mention hie name." 

 "Ye think ye deed P-sald MtoClure satirically, and once more the audi ence took a leading part 

 "He was a great boxer!" Dare Broggs affirmed. 

 "May th' Lord forgl' ye," snapped MoClure, and the coda yelled and whistled their delight 

 In the middle of the pandemonium an undersized Btock-headed Irishman whom Uie programme aald was Mr. Ddoley, a nelgblboor," bounced on, and throwing his halt on the floor said, addressing Bitogga: 

 "Be th' powers above an' below, an' beneath. 01 congratoolatea yes-a Jus tice o' th' Pace! But it's meseU Iihwnt's piwlder ot yel nor If yez wer' 

 me own brathar, An', en' prwhat 'U> It be worth to yee In goMT" 

 Broggs grinned and said he didn't 

 think It would be worth anything. 

 "Do yas tell me that It won't?" Mil DooJey disappointedly. 

 "It's an honorary poaeetlon, moo," McClnre explained tor Dooley'g bene 

 fit 

 "An honorary poaltton?" Dooley repeated with an air of perplexity. 

 "Ye dlnna undaratoon' becalse ye hoe no sense o' honour . yumrsel', Dooley," said MioClure. 

 . "See that now," remarked Dooley, with a side wink at the audience. 

 "Hal Hat Hal Ha! Hal Ha!" cams from Peter, . and the man behind touched him on the ttioulder and eald: ' 

 "What's he paying yon Tor smiling at his Jokes?" 

 Tilly 'nadead James, and tiny, botH glanced book at the man. 

 The play rattled on. 

 "Well,- lt'they glye me aaythlnB I'll take li, you may depend." oil Broggs assured Dooley. 

 "An' they'll give it," Dooley ans wered, "they'll give It; an' sure It they don't _yez can give them tlx
