THE CAMP AT WANDINONG. 

 By Ethel Turner. 

 CHAPTER III. 

 

 There was a curious difference and distinction observable in the play of Dorrie and Bert, that was due to imagination and the want of it. 

 Dorrie was eminently practical. Her favourite game took colour from the life around them. There was always a gold mine in it ; when she picked up sticks and tree branches they instantly became pick-axes or shovels. When she was not Peterson she was one of the miners of Coolgardie fame. She invariably smoked as she dug - at all events, she kept a twisted piece of wood in her lips that she called her pipe. Sometimes she muttered words under her breath that made Bert's hair stand on end. She never unearthed a nugget of less value than �20,000. Bert was happiest galloping on a great stick through the blind, bush tangle beyond the creek ; plunging into prickly shrubs to rescue maidens who were under spells of enchantment ; flying along through rocky defiles and mountain passes, a bushranger with a price on his head ; sticking a white cock's feather in his old sailor hat and leading a " fousand" knights in a wild rush upon the army of the League. Sometime he induced Dorrie to play too. Five days he would dig obediently and help her lift a great boulder of stone, and shout and joy exceedingly with her when they decided it was the best find since the rush in '72, and worth �100,000 if a penny. But on the sixth he would mutiny, and insist she should be a " merry man" or an enchanted princess, or Virginia walking innocently along, unaware that the bit of stick up his sleeve was a whittle soon to be plunged in her side. And if she refused, he would still follow her, and hang about while she excavated and brought treasures to light, but his mouth would be smileless, and requested to join in admiration when the " Welcome Nugget" was unearthed, would say with unfeeling coldness : " Pooh, it's nofring but a bit of ole brown stone." On these occasions, Dorrie generally gave in to the inevitable, and became a Princess under protest ; no one could keep on turning up marvellous treasures with dampers like that. But she dragged gold into the games with her. If she was a Princess under the spell of a wizard, she insisted upon living in a castle where the dungeons were filled with bags and bags of gold and diamonds and rubies, that the rescuing prince would get when he broke the spell. If she was a bushranger, she always had a cave where, in a hole underground, were stolen treasures enough to buy up a city. If she was a knight, pressing where she saw a "white plume shine amidst the ranks of war," she always insisted upon sacking a city after the victory, and going back laden with spoils. Peterson worshiped the children. He had been at Wandinong two years instead of three months, which is all the time he would have given the wretched place if it had not been for the sunshine they gave him. Years ago on that far west station, he had worshiped the " cheerful young lady at �20 

 a year." Never told her so, of course ; he was merely a drover, and had no vision of her for weeks and months at a time. But when he rode beside his slowly stringing stock towards the burning sunsets, and thought idly of the fire he would make in another mile or two, and the billy he would boil, and the shade in which he would lie, then he used also to think of her laugh and her little blowing curls, and her thin, small hands. One time when he had been travelling with sheep for grass he was away four months. He went up to the homestead on his return to beg the papers for the news of the world, and to let his eyes see Mary. The children told him the news - Miss Martin was married and had gone away - what a pity he had not been there to see the silver teapot they had given her. In four years the memory naturally had become merely a gentle, faded one. He went still further "out West"; he helped to battle with the eternal droughts that reigned there ; he sheared his 100 sheep in a day ; he worked on a station where racehorses were bred, and caught a passing racing fever that swept away the pile shearing had accumulated. Then he sickened of stock and saddle and runs ; sickened of the sight of a roping-pole or branding-iron - bore with them for another year, for his nature was a curiously slow one ; then he drifted out of it, and became a man with a swag, journeying nowhere, telling one bush story over a camp fire in the " land of lots o' time along the Castlereagh," and a companion one in the bar of an inn on the Lachlan. From chopping wood at Cowra, he drifted to places where the earth gaped piteously, and tents made gray white spots in the burnt bush. He bought a pickaxe himself, and drifted again. Dorrie and Bert found him one day pegging out a little claim right on their favourite playground. He made friends with them ; there was something in Dorrie's resolute little mouth and hands that warmed him to her. They went home and told Mary of the new man who had come�a very brown man, with dull, queer eyes that looked as if the sun had burnt them, a rough, brown beard, and very rough hair. The description fitted half-a-hundred diggers. She went one day hunting for five corners and native quondongs in the bush with the children, and they came across him. He recognised her in a moment, but the nine years of trouble and fighting and love had swept him entirely from her memory. He did not recall himself ; merely talked of the children to her, and the prospect of the place and prospects elsewhere. He did not attempt to " blow hard upon the aches" of the little faded memory. His ethics were quite simple, and it was enough that she was married. But he allowed himself to look forward to the comings of the children, and he let their hands fasten around his heart till they made a wonderful place of it. When Mary found how quiet and respectable he was, and heard from Bert and Dorrie that they had scarcely ever heard him swear, she let them go again to their old playground, for they had been very anxious to superintend his operations, and give advice and demonstration when they heard he was quite new at the work. Dorrie took him as her especial protege. When she found he washed with an old fashioned cradle, and in a way of his own, she gave him no rest until he had invested in one of just the same shape as her father's, and promised for the future to do it just in " this way." He was almost as good to play with as Bert. She used to take the little old crowbar she had picked up, and dig and pick away or wash at the creek beside him for hours at a time, and he was never too engrossed with his own work to wax enthusiastic when she had a "splendid find." And he never got out of humour, and found the wonderful things she rushed to his side merely "ole brown stones." When she appraised a piece of dull quartz at �300,000, he used to eye it critically, and " be hanged if he should be surprised if it fetched a clear half-million." With Bert he was just as ready of interest and sympathy. He never smiled at his wildest extravagances, and when bidden excitedly to " just look at the cavalry dashing into the fickest of the fight," looked instantly - more than that, saw. And such stories he could tell. The gift had surely been born with him. There was no subject on land or sea he could not hold one breathless upon for an hour. Stories - some of them strong of the soil, of burning days and fiery nights on the great blank plain of the Centre ; of sheep creeping with lolling tongues and patient eyes for miles and miles and miles through sun-ravaged country, and lying down to die just before the water and green pastures were reached ; of desperate fights with bush fires ; of the queer wave of aboriginals ; of the wild joy of drafting scrub cattle ; of hunting kangaroo ; of feats of swift shearing, of branding. Strange that, soul sickened as he was of it all, he could delve back into it and find fascination and glory in the recount. He told them once, carried away by his own eloquence, it was the only life in the world for a man. " Then why did you leave it ?" Bert said discontentedly. He could find no enthusiasm for this monotonous life of picking at the earth, and would have had Peterson vault into a saddle and go back to the greenness of those other days. But there came to the man the memory of the monotony of them - of the taste of ashes his mouth had held. " Oh, damn it all !" he said, with sudden fire, and forgetful that the little gaping ears beside him were those of Mary's children. Bert looked startled. Dorrie laughed, but made a mental marginal note to the effect that her mother must not be told of the slip. " You are a queer man," she said. Then, confidentially, and edging away from her small brother's hearing, " Do you know, I was beginning to think you didn't know any swear words." He looked at her helplessly. " Do you know many ?" she pursued. " Isn't it s'prising what lots there are ? Do you know ' darn my buttons,' and ' blind me' ? I've just learnt those - not that 

 they're so very bad. Of course, mother doesn't know." But the dull, burnt eyes looked at her with horror. He remembered the little nursery governess's dainty speech and purity of phrase. " If ever," he said, " I hear you say a word you shouldn't, I'll march you straight off to your mother and ask her to whip you. I didn't think you were such a wicked little girl." " Why," said Dorrie, " I don't think that's much. You hear worse than that wherever you walk. I take no notice of it." She smiled, amusedly. But his eyes glowed still more warmly. " If ever," he said, " if ever I hear one of those fellows say a word he shouldn't, I'll knock his head off - or if I say a word myself. The thought of his own vocabulary made him suddenly nervous and humble. It was from that date, therefore, he constituted himself the keeper of the tongues of Bert and Dorrie - more especially Dorrie. 

 CHAPTER IV. There was extreme gloom on Dorrie's face, her eyes were cast down, no words were on her lips ; she walked across the rough ground with so dejected an air that Bert's plastic soul felt flattened with oppression. " Don't frink about them, Dorrie dear," he begged ; " then you'll forget them. "Frink you're my white charger, an' I'm a king ; let's play them there bushes are enemies, and we're just goin' to dash froo." Dorrie raised her brooding eyes for one half-second. " Them there's very bad grammar, Bert," she said. " Wilkinson's Ann says ' them there.' You've got to say ' those.' " " Those," amended Bert ; " and the littlest lot of bushes is the frird battalion, and we're goin' to smash it up to smifereens, eh ? Come on, Dorrie." Dorrie's mouth pursed. " We'd get our good clothes torn," she said ; " they're kangaroo apple bushes." Bert's blue eyes stared at her. He stopped prancing ; he brought the arm he had waved aloft in king-like fashion down to the level of his other one. " I don't frink we would, Dorrie," he said, after a pause; "'T least, only a teeney bit." " Well," said Dorrie morosely, "at all events, I'd get my face hot with running." Bert's soft little mouth opened baby fashion, as if to help his eyes to stare. "What, say ?" he said. "I'd get my face hot. " repeated Dorrie ; "it would perspire, look at the sun." With his customary obedience, Bert looked and, when he found it was not rolling visibly about in the sky, or doing anything else extraordinary, he blinked back tearfully at his sister. "What's the matter with it ?" he said. Dorrie strode by. " I might get a freckle on my nose ?" she said darkly. Then he understood her mood, and looked helplessly at her boots. " Oh, I frink you might stop frinking about them," he said. "There'll be no time left. We've got to weed the carrots, and you've got your 'clensions to learn. Smallest said we could only be out an hour. Le's start, an' make a gold mine." Dorrie poked him with her thin, sharp elbow. " That's the third time you've said 'Smallest' this afternoon," he said. " I shall have to tell mother of you." Bert looked ready to cry. " It's not my fault, Dorrie," he said. " 'Twasn't me made you have to wear them. Oh, you might be nice ; 'sides, frink how much better it is for the skeeters sandflies not to be biting away at you." He held out one of his own scratched, swollen little legs to illustrate how much better she fared. But she looked at it enviously. " I'd rather have ten million sandflies," she said. " Le's dig," said Bert, eagerly - the tone of voice had been her own again. " Le's dig mines just here ; shouldn't you frink, Mr. Alkali Ike, there's nuggets knocking round ? Why, what's this ? Here's the gold plant growing like mad all over." But Dorrie would not respond to the name she had once chosen to be called by ; she pushed her yellow curls off her shoulders and remarked languidly that the plant growing like mad was mallee. Then Bert gave up in despair. He sat down on a hillock of earth and wept silently for a minute or two, with his jacket sleeve at his eyes. He could never remember so spoilt a playtime in his life. Dorrie was the most wonderful little mate in the world. She waited in perfect silence for him to finish, waited with her eyes on her respectable boots. Every hateful inch of their shiny leather, each lace hole, every rib of the black stockings were photographed in her mind. " When people begin to wear boots and stockings," she said, " they can't be nice any longer. They have to be always thinking of grammar and freckles and things." Then the good, obedient little soul of Bert fell into temptation. " Dorrie," he said. Dorrie's eyes snapped, but she did not look at him. " How'd it be, Dorrie," he whispered, "if you slipped 'em off for just one little play ?" Neither of them looked at each other ; Dorrie's left hand went down and untied a boot, but the right one followed after and helped to tie it again. " You see I promised Smallest," she said gloomily. But the next moment both hands rushed down and pulled a lace in and out, in and out to the bottom. Off flew the boot, down went the stocking ; a little, hard leg was gloriously bare once more. " I won't take them off," repeated Dorrie; " that was what I promised, wasn't it ? But she didn't even ask me not to take one off." She danced about, quite happy again ; she hopped on the bare one, caressed it, patted it, stroked it. She called on it to go and kick the stockinged one. " Let's go and see Peterson and the other fellows now," Bert said. She had refused before, being unwilling to be disgraced just yet before all her old friends. " Come on," said the little wild one, darting on ahead. She was down among a group of men, exchanging greetings, parrying questions, long before the slower travelling Bert arrived, her shoe and stocking safe within the loose front of his sailor blouse. " They were six and frepence," he muttered, 

 going back for them. " Smallest couldn't afford them again." " Dorrie's clothed leg was hidden in some marvellous fashion up her frock. Standing on her one bare one she looked to the men just like the little friend who had come and chatted with them almost every morning for six or seven years. " Get all your lessens done ?" said Peterson. " All but ' trabs, trabio,' " answered Dor- rie ; " I've that to do when I go in. Spell 'harass,' Peterson." Peterson stopped digging, scratched his head, rubbed his nose, and finally spelt it with two " r's." She chuckled and asked No-nose Adams for embarrass. It went right across the creek and back again, and no one got it right. " You're getting too much of a scholar for us, Dorrie," Peterson said ; " there's no keeping up with you." Dorrie gave them the catch rhyme. She called painstakingly up and down the little line of washers, and made them repeat it each and each in turn. " One r in harass, and two in embarrass. But both I confess must have double s." No-nose Adams said it with admiration, for it plainly expressed on hie vacuous face. " It's a won'ful thing," he said. " Well, spell ' harass' now, quickly," said Dorrie, tripping him up swiftly. And he floundered into a mire that held two r's, one s, and no h. When they wearied of orthography, and had done their very best with seven nine's and eight seven's, and listened patiently to the fact that " wheat came originally from Egypt, and was brought to Marseilles before the Romans had penetrated into Gaul," Bert was in demand. He spelt book and oven and dish for them ; he added 4 and 5 together, took away 3 and found the answer 6, amidst great applause. He told them that a noun was the name of anything - as soldier, horse. " Or nugget, quartz, pickaxe," supplemented Dorrie Then Adams swung the little lad up on the broad branch of a low tree on the bank, and at the well-known signal the washers all stopped work. One raked dried wood together, lit a fire, and slung on a couple of billies. The others took their pipes from their mouths, sat down on the ground, and took hunches of bread and meat or cheese from their pockets. Dorrie put her leg carefully under her, and sat in the midst of them. " Fire away," said Peterson, dipping his tin mug into the little billy that boiled first. " King Henry of Navarre ?" said the little boy. " No." said Adams, " we had that yester- day, and the day before. I ain't forgot about that game little ship - hev yer ?" Jones nodded approval. " Bloomin' good poem that there." Jones's mate drank a pannikin of tea with a loud throat noise. He hit the ground with the empty tin, and his lips opened and shut. " An' 'e said, ' fight on, fight on,' " he muttered ; " an' 'e said, ' fight on.' " " Oh," said Dorrie, " have something shorter. I want to hear about Henderson and Gaffney fighting each other last night ; that thing's so blooming long." Peterson allowed his tea to become a drowning-place for buzzing flies. He crossed over to the little girl. " Off you go home." he said, " scoot along ; you've been here quite long enough." Dorrie held fast to the earth with her hands:. " I won't say it again ; it slipped out," she said. " Oh, please let me stay Peterson." " Let her stop," said Adams, twas my fault." " I've let you off twice," said Peterson ; " skip along home this time."" " Oh," said Dorrie ; " please be nice, Peter. I do beg your pardon, and I won't say it again, true's I live." " But you said that before," said Peterson. Dorrie patted his hand affectionately. " Go and drink your tea, Peter." she said ; " there's a bulldog crawling up the side, and it won't taste nice in a minute." " Stop gassin'," said Jones's mate, " and let the little lad start, for" - he sought assiduously amongst his words for an inoffensive noun - " for hookey's sake." Then into the requested silence ran the thin, eager, flexible voice of the boy. How it lingered over the words, how it mouthed the brave speeches, how it hurried and trembled along the exciting bits ! " Sir Richard spoke and he laughed, and we roared a hurrah, and so� " Quite as a chorus came the next line, the men all knew it and loved it as well as the boy and absolutely could not refrain from " chipping in," as Dorrie expressed it. " And so : - The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe." Then alone once more rushed on the eager voice� " Fousands of their soldiers look'd down from their decks, and laughed ; Fousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft." Peterson's pipe went out, No Nose Adams puffed laboriously ; there were tears of enthusiasm in the eyes of Jones and Jones's mate. Dorrie alone chewed a bit of grass in perfect unconcern, and felt glad for every verse that was finished, since it brought her nearer to hearing about Gaffney, who had stolen Henderson's loin of mutton - " And the sun went down and the stars came out, far over the summer sea, But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty free. Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high built galleons came ; Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle funder and flame ; Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame, For some were sunk, and many were scattered, and so could fight us no more. God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before ?" The young voice gasped, excitement had dried the little swelling throat. Adams plunged forward with his pannikin. " Take a pull," he said, holding it out. " 'E likes more sugar," said Jones's mate, hastening up with his little newspaper packet and emptying it all in. Then, refreshed, Bert ran on again ; his 

 short, fat legs dangled from the branch, one hand grasped the overhanging bough, the other went to help the declamation. Such a red little face he had ! " But Sir Richard cried, in his English pride, We have fought such a fight for a day and a night, As may never be fought again ! We have won great glory, my men ! And a day, less or more, At sea or ashore, We die - does it matter when ? Sink me the ship, Master Gunner - sink her, split her in twain ! Fall into the hands of God - not into the hands of Spain !" There came quite a groan of disappointment from Jones's mate. " There's the red 'andkerchief," he said. " Oh, darn it all," said Jones, " it won't hurt to wait till the end ; go it little un." The " little un" had slithered from his pole, and was looking around doubtfully. " Come on," said Dorrie, virtuously ; " we must go." " If I 'adn't seen th' 'ankerchief, you'd never a saw it," Jones's mate said. " 'Ow'd yer ma ter say as 'ow you've seed it yet ?" Bert's unwilling eyes went over the flat lands to the tree-clad hill-rise, where the wave of colour showed against the green. He looked back at his friends, and Adams was looking so dejectedly sorry his tongue picked up the theme again : " And the gunner said, ' Ay, ay,' but the seamen made reply, ' We have children, we have wives' 'And the�" But Peterson lifted him up from the ground by the back of his loose coat. " Nick away," he said. " Now, Dorrie, off with you both this minute." Dorrie dragged herself up in a curious fashion. She had intended to make her retreat when the men had gone back to work again, and now here were all eyes on her. " Scoot along," said Peterson, " look alive, womany. What are you doing with your leg ? Has it gone to sleep ?" But Dorrie went hopping off in greatest haste. " I'm pretending I'm a stork," she mumbled. And, stick in hand, she progressed on her one bare leg till the bush shelter permitted the use of two.  To Be Continued.
