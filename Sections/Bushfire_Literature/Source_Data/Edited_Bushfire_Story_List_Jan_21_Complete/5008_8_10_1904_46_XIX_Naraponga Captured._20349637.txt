 CHAPTER XIX.�Naraponga Captured. 

 (By "Bulloo.") (Author of "Gurramon." "Ullaweera." Etc.) 

 Next morning the search was re-<*> newed with increased vigour, com-<*> mencing at a point a quarter of a mile from the camp, the circle being 

 gradually extended. About eleven O'clock Muro found the tracks of three persons, but they were so in distinct that Naraponga could not idiscern them, and they could not be followed. Still the friends were not discouraged, but patiently sought for the trail until sundown, when they returned to the camp, intending to make another attempt in the morning. But-soon after dark a ruddy glow . appeared in the sky in the direction in which it was supposed the three persons had gone, and as the wind was blowing in their direction Muro looked towards the Chief, who said : "I'm afraid that will settle it. That's a Dush fire, and it's coming to wards us. If the tracks were only two days old the fire would smother them with the ashes of the burnt grass." "I'm afraid our luck is oat," nun* inured Charley. "The fire tells us one thins, though," said the Chief, "and that Is, whoever lighted it is on the line we think the tracks were going. Isnt that so, Muro ?" "Yes, but a different party may have lighted the fire." " That's so," replied the Chief, "but .we'll hope it was not." By morning the fire was within a mile of them, its smoke almost driv ing them out of the camp. 

 "We'd better make towards the river," said Naraponga. "Although the fire is not travelling very fast, and we could light another to block it* the smoke is abominable, it is veering away to the North now a little, and we'll be out of the line of smoke in a mile." With labouring breath and stream ing eyes the friends made haste to wards the river. They had trusted too much to the greenness of the grass to check the fire, or they would have struck camp much sooner. They ran no risk of losing their lives, but they had a most unpleasant experience which taught them a valu able lesson. It did not take them long to reach the outside of the smoke, but as the river was still some distance off and there was nothing to he gained in going to it, the Chief and Charley camped lasily while Muro replenished the larder- By evening the fire had Bwept far away, and the air was sufficiently clear of smoke for them to continue their journey, which, how ever, was deferred until next day. The bush fire had passed many miles away to the south, and making a detour to avoid walking through the burnt country the friends pushed on in the direction in which they felt sure the blacks who held Estelle .were to be found. Being in splendid training they reached the Northern most limit of the burnt country be fore dark, and were rewarded by finding fresh signs of blacks. As one could scout with less risk of discovery than a greater number, Muro was sent ahead while the others camped. The tracks led in a straight line north, being three in number and only one day old. Two of the tracks were undoubtedly those of adult blacks, while Muro had no hesitation in pronouncing the third to be that of Estelle. Bestowing themselves comfortably in the shade of a tree, Naraponga and Charley stretched themselves out on the grass and succumbing to the drowsy heat shortly fell asleep. Their awakening was a rude one, for with returning consciousness they .were struggling in the grasp of a number of black warriors, and in spite of their frantic struggles were securely bound. Thoroughly exhausted with their efforts to get free, the captives re mained silent for some minutes while their captors yabbered in the highest glee, capering about and clapping each other on the back. At length the Chief said : "My word! we've teen caught napping this time with a vengeance. I wonder who they are ; they talk like Mlappes, but I didn't know there .?ere so many away from the main camp." '1 wonder why they didnt kill us right off," said Charley. " Want to make a raree show of us Brat I expect," was the reply. At this Juncture one of the blacks paid something rapidly, when they disappeared in the bushes, leaving the captives to themselves. 

 " What's up ?" said Charley. " They've remembered � Muro," was the reply, " and they are planting for him." " Hadn't we better warn him V said the lad eagerly. " I was Just about doing so," re sponded the Chief, and the guttural croak of the gray pelican sounded through the forest. The notes sound ed so natural that the lad looked up into the sky expecting to see the bird flying overhead. Again the bird's cry floated away, and was responded to by a nulla nulla that crashed against a tree close to the Chief's head. "That was pretty close," said he. " The niggers have guessed my game, and Muro will have to take his chance." Fortunately Muro had heard the timely warning, and not seeing any birds knew what was meant, sending the shrill cry of the stone plover in reply. The blacks remained hidden until dark, when they returned to the cap tives, and having lighted a fire pre pared the evening meal. Choosing the most amiable looking of the blacks Naraponga demanded the reason of their, capture. " What else could you expect ?" was the reply. "We thought you would endeavour to take our white girl from us and kept a lookout, so when we found you on our tracks we tried to baffle you with a bashfire. Finding that ineffective we decoyed you with two warriors and the girl. We did not expect to catch the great Nara ponga so easily, but fortune was with us and we have got him. In a short time he won't trouble about the white girl any more, or about anything 

 else." "Charley, my boy, I've got you in to a bad fix this time," *aid Nara ponga. "Rot," was the reply. "I was every bit as keen as you to find the Princess, so you needn't blame your self." "That may be right enough," said the Chief, "but I'm the experienced man of the party, and should not nave been caught this way." "Cheer up," said the lad. "We're not dead yet, and I'll be very much surprised if we dont get out of our difficulty all right." "As long as Muro it free we have a chance," said the Chief. "He la full of resource, and as game as a pebble. While we're alive he'll never rest until we escape." As night drew on the blacks ex amined the bonds of the whites and lay round the lire, leaving two of their number on guard. The blacks numbered fifteen, ten of whom were men in their prime, while the others, though old, would be tough antagon ists In a fight. These men had been scattered about the district, and either intentionally or accidentally had escaped the call to arms when the Miappe attacked the Taroengas. They had met one of the refugees after the disastrous ambush in the gorge, and instead of returning to the main camp hastened to another part of the territory, where they met the small party in charge of Estelle, when, finding the whites were endeavouring to recover the white girl, they laid their plans to capture them. The blacks felt they had undertaken a difficult proposition, but as they did not intend to yield up the girl, and ran the risk of being shot in retain ing her, they decided to take the initiative. They could hardly believe their ears when one of their number who was scouting told them the whites were fast asleep within half a mile of them, and seized the opportunity of effecting a bloodless capture with avidity. Several times Naraponga begged their guards to ease their bonds so that they could go to sleep, for the 

 fiords had been tied tightly round their wrists, and had caused them to swell, giving them great pain. At first the blackfellow� declined in surly tones, and finally took no notice. Occasionally the stone plover was heard calling, and they knew Muro was at hand, but helpless to assist them while the sentinels were awake. In the morning the ties were re moved from their hands so that they could eat, but it was some minutes before their swollen fingers were of any ulse to them. When all was eaten the prisoners' hands were again se cured, but their leg bonds were loosened so that they could walk free ly, when a start was made for the distant camp. Acting under a hint from the Chief, Charley became very tired, dragging his feet and stumbling over the tus socks of grass. Becoming impatient the leader, named Koondachi (cray fish), threatened him with a spear, when Naraponga said : "How can you expect a young lad to walk freely when you had his legs 

 tied tightly together all night. If you want him to got along you must go Blower." " We have nearly thirty miles to go before dark," was the reply. " Well, then, you'll have to go slow er or leave us behind, for the lad is not able to go so far, and I wont leave him," "We can kill him," was the reply, and a sharp spear will soon make you walk away from him. He is of no consequence, but you must he made to accompany us." . "No torture you can devise will make me walk a yard if you kill that boy," replied the Chief. " You have heard that I always keep my word, and I'll not break it now." In half an hour Charley fell, and when set up on his feet staggerea a few yards and again came to the ground. " Tou must let him rest," said Naraponga, sitting down by the ap parently exhausted lad. The blacks were very angry, and leaving two of their number to watch the whites withdrew a short distance and held an animated discussion. After a little while Koondachi ap proached saying : "We dpn't care what becomes of the white lad, so if we leave him behind will you come on freely with us to the camp ?*' " This will give Charley a chance to escape," thought the Chief, " but delay will be better, as it will afford Muro more time to help us both away. Anyhow, I'll argue the point for a time," but before he could re ply Charley said : "Don't let us be separated, Chief. Voluntarily I won't stay behind and leave you, so its no use you agreeing to that proposition." " You must leave everything in my hands, old fellow," replied Naraponga. "I'm thinkinc it out. and will decide 

 presently what is best to be done. If you are left Muro will soon Join you, and you may be able to help bim to release me. In any case your ac companying me to the camp won't help either you or me." "Come, be quick," said Koondachi, " we have no time to waste." " Why not camp for an hour or two so that the lad can travel with us ?" replied Naraponga. " Because we have special reason for returning to the camp to-night." said Koondachi. " Are you afraid your gins will run away ?" demanded Naraponga sneer ingly. "It is sufficient for you to knojt. that we intend reaching the c^saptch night," replied Koondachi s4mgi#y f "so if you don't come wUflnsir'we'll kill that miserable whip drfgo �n�> and carry you." /'"%/ r% v Naraponga saw that/the VQ& *or temporising had vsseL^Jn nnng^kd his feet he said: V A *�"*'� V, "Agreed, let the boAioT^dJ^n accompany you. But leave^RMlCTood with him." "Do you consider us fools ?" said the Chief. "Do you think we do not know the blackboy is somewhere be hind us and will look after him. If we had time we'd run him down, and bring his head for you to look at. Come on." "Well, at least untie his bonds," urged Naraponga. "Tour blackboy can do that," was the impatient reply. Ab it was useless delaying any longer Naraponga leant over Charley and pressing his bound hands against the lad's said : "Au revoir, sonny. Don't be alarm ed about me. Muro will be with you in a few minutes, and with his help you'll have me a free man in no time." But Charley was not so sanguine, and it was with a sob in his throat that he uttered " au revoir." Two of the blacks hung behind, when the band was starting, to way lay Muro and no doubt to kill Charley, but Naraponga halted, saying: "We all go together, or I won't go at all �� 

 At a nod from Koondacbi the two men came up, and they again Bet for ward, Naraponga waving his bound hands to the white lad as he dis appeared from view in the forest. In less than half an hoar Muro ap proached Charlie and cut the thongs with which he was bound, at the same time asking for Naraponga. When Charley had explained everything the black lad Bald : " Naraponga is always right. It was no use taking you into the camp, for neither of you might escape, whereas you are free now." " Besides, I can help you to re lease him," said Charley eagerly. Muro hesitated as he said : " Oh, yes, of coarse, if it comes to fighting." " I know I'm no good at tracking or anything of that sort, or walking noiselessly through the bash," replied Charley humbly; H but we may have some hand to hand fighting, and I'd die before I'd give in. We could save him if those confounded niggers would only throw away the firearms and ammunition. Don't you think 

 they may get tired of carrying them ?" Muro shook his head, saying : " They won't cast them away while you and I are free." When Charley told Muro how Nara ponga had prevented some of the blacks from hanging behind Muro clapped his thigh, saying : " I'm glad to know that. We can walk much faster when we know they won't waylay us. Come on, Charley, we mustn't get too far behind." Koondachi and his followers main tained a good pace until about three o'clock, when a halt was made at a lagoon for an hour, most of which was spent in the water. The blacks bathed until they became quite cold, when they squatted near a fire until they were hot again, repeating the operation twice during the hour. Towards sundown Koondachi told his prisoner that owing to the various delays they could not reach the camp until two hours after dark, but they had determined to push on. As darkness approached it occurred to the whiteman that he would not be able to prevent one or more of the blacks from leaving the party under cove* of night, and ambushing his friends, who would surely be follow ing them at no great distance. Al though he racked his brains he could not devise a plan of warning them, and was in despair when herald al most audibly : "What a goat I am! As if Muro would be taken in such a soft manner as that." The band were received with ac clamation by their families, and Es telle, who Baw Naraponga immediate ly they entered the camp, ran up and hugged him Joyfully, when, observing the Chief was alone, she cried : " Where is Charley ? Oh, surely he is not killed, and poor Muro too ? Where are they ?" Naraponga assured her of their safety, enquiring in turn how the savages had treated her. As the girl looked the picture of health the question was almost superfluous, and she replied that they had been very kind, carrying her most of the way, though one day she had been sent with two men and they had made her walk. She knew it was done for a purpose, and was afraid it was meant to decoy them. Her blue serge trousers had been replaced with a pair made from dressed kangaroo skin, and although their artist could not even claim they were well cut, they slaved the girl's limbs from the burning rays of the sun as s well as the bushes. 7T*9braponga was fed by the girl, for � hta^hands were quite benumbed, and X the llackfi, fastening his feet secure \\ly,"r�moved the ties from his wrists.
