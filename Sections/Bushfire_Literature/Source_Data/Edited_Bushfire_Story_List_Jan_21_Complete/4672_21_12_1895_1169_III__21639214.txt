 CHAPTER III.�"A Queen of Noble Nature's Crowning." 

 BY ELLERTON GAY. Author of "Drifting Under the Southern cross," the Gulf," gathered Rue," &c. 

 When we are tired of our personality what a comfort it would be If some one would take and melt us down into another mould ! Then we might wake 

 In the morning Into a new life, full of potentialities, without that gnawing sense of discouragement that comes of knowing our own limitations, impoten clefl, and failures, and encouraged to begin again, with higher ideals before us, with the knowledge that the old self bas become disintegrated, that its mole cules have once more been separate atoms, though agate combined to make a whole, but one which shall present a different aspect to the world and to our selves. It was customary with Gay. Stasfhope to wake In the morning with some such' thought of dissatisfaction with self. A fortnight later than the day Jack Ogttvy bad brought Owen her engagement ring, Gay started into wakefulness at an earlier hour than usual and a sudden resolve shaped Itself in her mind. She Jumped out of bed, and wrapping her self in her dressing-gown, opened her window to see the full moon paling and trembling at the top of the purple hills as the sun rose behind Bendemere. In the hush of the morning she heard the wongas calling from the little belt cf scrub in the gully, and the soft bleat ing of sheep In the distance. Rain had put a stop to shearing for three days, but the wool was dry again, and the rouseabouts were astir with the dawn, getting the sheep penned for the shearers. Gay looked out over the landscape she loved so well, dwelling with tender interest in every feature of the hills that hemmed In Bendemere from the wide monotony of the plains below. The head station was bulk on a broad plateau midway down the slope of a high hill that rose in stony abruptness above it. The house itself was in front, and all Its dependencies were spread out along the plateau behind. The men's huts, the store, and such like buildings, were hidden round the abrupt side of the mountain ; only the tiny chapel (occupied in turn by minis ters of every denomination who offered their services), stood out beside the house, its Gothic porch, in solid masonry, -which had lately been added by Diok Wentworth, greatly overbalancing tfoe remainder of the building. The house was In the shape of an L., presenting Its longer portion to the gracious slope of the garden ; an inner and smaller L? formed .the kitchens and servants' quarters, and a covered space between them made a cool loggia for hot weather. Gay hardly remembered any other home, and she loved it exceedingly. She could not think of herself as apart from Bendemeer. She was thinking of herself on this morning, with a rush of painful memory Whtdh with reflex action pointed out a plain duty to her. She looked troubled as she sat sbiver ns; a little la the fresh morning air Her lovely red-brown hair hung in a loose tumbled mass. and her dark *ray eyes, shaded by eyelashes several �had�s darker than her hair, darted restlessly. She was tall and slight, with hands and feet almost too slender for symmetry. Her face was refined and beautiful in Its nobility of expression. Married and a widow within a few months, it often happened to her that she forgot what had been a brief episode in her life, .and when strangers addressed her as Mrs. Stanhope, scarcely recognised the name as her own. She had always been M Miss Gay** on the station, and many of the people there had probably forgotten that she was entitled to the matronly designation. In no sense had Gay been forced into a marriage with Robert Stanhope, although it was a match which had seemed most suitable. She had believed herself to be hi love with him in the .ordinary way ; but at the moment she had been convinced of this, a quite oppo 

 site conviction was painfully forced upon her. There ore moments when we realise our own personalities, and we see our own eyes in the dark. Such a moment came for Gay Stanhope when Robert had said, " Kiss me, Gay," as he lay covered with blood at her feet, with a great torn wound in his side and a bullet-hole in the temple. With no feeling- but one of utter loathing: and horror she had placed her lips to his�so near it seemed to the ghastly death-wound �slokentng with the smell of blood and cold with repul sion, and gave the kiss he had asked for. She realised then, with' a 'shiver of ap prehension, that she could not have felt thus towards her dying husband if she had really loved him, and that if he should chance to live she would never be able to deceive herself again Into be lieving she .did so. This conviction struck her with the cruel force of cer tainty. Robert Stanhope was a fine, manly young fellow, with a strong animal nature, handsome, healthy, and care lessly good-humoured. He had strongly resisted his father's wish that he should finish his education at an English Uni versity. Nothing he had said should in duce him to leave Australia ; he hated the very idea of fog and frost, gray skies and east winds, and he was allowed to have bis own way. Horse-racing was a passion with him ; hia wedding-day, even, was. fixed with the principal rac ing fixtures in view. Next to hone racing, he enjoyed life on the station, and was in his element at mustering time, when with bridle hanging loose on hia horse's neck, the animal turning and twisting in response to the touch of its rider's knee, he raced through timber at breakneck speed after a refractory beast, or at a kangaroo drive, following the flying drove towards the mountain yards, or killing wild bulls in the scrub with unerring rifle-shot, breaking in horses, or in the tamer pursuits that the cycle of work on a sheep and cattle sta tion offers, all brought to him the joy that at such occupations no man was his master. He had been going for a ride with his young wife, and, being ready first, had gone to the kilUug-yards, where a* bullock was being driven under the gallows, to be shot for beef. He took the gun from the man whose work it was to do the kill ing, and, waiting until the bullock was where his carcass could be most easily strung up on the gallows, he took fair aim at the carl In the forehead and fired. The animal was restive, and Robert missed his aim. The bullet ploughed a furrow along* the beast's shoulder .and went Into the ground. He gave the gun to be reloaded, and at the moment he did so a mounted trooper rode up, and stopped curiously to watch what was going on. The bullet with which the gun was being loaded stuck in the muzzle, and the trooper, drawing his big Government pistol from, its holster, said, " Here, boss, let me shoot the beast for you. This little barker will soon settle his goose." Robert assented, and got tip on the stockyard fence to watch the shooting. The trooper took a steady aim, and the shot should have been instantly fatal, but the beast tossed its head at the critical moment. The bullet, instead of piercing the hard skull glanced oft it transversely, and, with a force hardly at all diminished, struck Robert Stanhope on the temple. He fell over the fence into the yard, but before the frightened bystanders could reach him the bullock had charged his prostrate body, and torn a great wound In his side with Its long, curved horns, through his thin, summer clothes. It was only a moment later that Gay rode up with her father. She was Just in time to see her husband breathe his last. It had been a terrible moment for her, not so much for the tragedy of It, as for its deep Inner meaning to herself. She had realised, in one flash of self-know ledge, what her life must have become had he lived. She knew, then, what had caused the weariness of life that she had felt, and she hated the knowledge that his death must bring her relief. None knew In those days of mourning how Gay Stanhope wore herself out with bitter self-reproach, when every one, in deepest pity for the tragedy that had widowed her, believed her to be crushed by woe. No one dreamt bat that she was fretting still, when months passed, and she showed no lightening of the gloom into which she was plunged. Bhe had never been the same since that day, but no one wondered. During theViort nwnihs of her mar ried life, Rob?rt had taksu 'a?x fr ;m one racecourse to another in the colonies, proud to show oft his young wife, yet im patient to leave her to go to the saddling, paddock and weighing-room, where he was known and consulted a* a man who knew the Ins and outs of every race in the colonies, and had the pedigree of �very winner at his finger ends. But Gay, who cared nothing for crowds or racing, nor for the attention and ad miration she excited, longed to be back at Bendemere. She fancied that to be home once more would content her unsatisfied heart. Robert was the same as he had always been ; he had not changed, nor was it likely that he would, she knew that. He was very fond of her, but it seemed to her that he was equally fond of a great marly other things, and she won dered why she was not jealous of them. As Gay recovered from her torpor after her husband's death, she recog nised that the fault had been In herself, not in him ; he gave what be had to give ; it was because she had isolated herself from human interests that she had failed to respond his love. She longed for some poor and afflicted humanity around her, that she might school herself by going among them and 

 seeing their misery. She wanted afflic tion* the niost revolting, that she might forget the agony of repugnance which seized her when it was required of her to kiss her dying husband. But around her at Bendemere there was neither vice nor misery. Every one was happy and contented, so she did her best to solace herself by sending- cheques <to such English charities as helped the lowest and most depraved. There was a woman on the station who had, among her numerous brood, a half-idiot child, who had npt the use of his limbs but was beautiful of face and was kept scrupously clean, and was his mother's darling, and Gay went often and nursed little Hans Bremen, and tried vainly to overcome her shudder at the touch of his nerveless body. She tried to be practical, too, and wished to learn housewifery, but Mrs. Wentworth did not encourage her, and laughed at her frequent mistakes ; and before long, Bobbie, who was almost emancipated from the schoolroom, took the management Into her capable young hands, and only consulted Gay occa sionally, when she was at her wits' end to contrive variations in the everlasting diet of mutton. So Gay returned to her books, and gave herself up to a dreamy, unpractical life of reading and verse making. No one but Bobbie knew of the little book containing a few doien sonnets that had been' the outcome of Gay's life of isolation from wide sym pathies/ and .even she had only read a few of them, and those uncomprehend- Irigly ; she could hot en<ture poetry, she said. Why Gay had. chosen the sonnet form with its limitations Gay hardly asked herself. Perhaps she took a joy In polishing her vagrant thoughts into a disciplined shape, lest they should run riot and lead her she knew not whither. The sonnets may have possessed small artlstio merit, but they were struck through and through with the voice of the great Australian continent, lovely with a love liness undreamt of in centres of life. Human beings entered but rarely Into her lines, only as some lost traveller, finding countless treasure of precious stones as he perished of thirst, or of brave explorers travelling into the heart of the unknown to wrest its secret from it for the benefit of mankind. She wrote of the lurid majesty of tropical storms ; of wild creatures flying before the blasting flames of a bush fire ; of the pitilessness of the unclouded sun and the land parched with draught, wOille the dumb misery of Animals seem ed unheeded of God ; of the scent of an orchid growing beyond the human reach, and the mystery of joy and sor row* of life and death. Joy in the human relation was a greater mystery to her than sorrow ; she felt the joy of breath- Ins; the soft, warm, eucalptus-ecented sir, in her long rides about the country ; of beholding the glories of sunrise over the mountains; of hearing the first heavy drops of rain fall after a weary drought, but of the joy of human sym pathy she seemed to herself to be Ignorant. Her mother loved her, but neither understood the other. Bobbie was a dear little soul, but very self-reliant, and would have as soon thought of look ing for support from Gay as she would have from a " monkey vine" if she had wished to climb to the moon. Her father's wants were few and simple, and Mrs. Wentworth made every one of them her own business; both parents mistook Gay's quietude for content. They rejoiced that she had outlived her sorrow, and would have stared In as tonishment had they been told she ached with yearning for a fuller Interest in her life, a wider sympathy for her heart They thought that she made her books suffice for every need of her heart and soul, and her absent replies, when she was absorbed In a book, proved a constant source of amusement in the famMy circle. "Gay, may I have your horse, jost for this one afternoon V Gwen ackd one day when Gay was deep In the enjoy ment of George Meredith's epigram matic pssjes. " Tes, dear," she replied without tak ing her eyes off the book, " but leave me the towels." "Have you a box that would do to pack emu eggs In, Gay V Bobbie asked once. " Eggs r* Gay asked, slanting her brows in thought, and perfunctorily closing her book, with her finger be tween the leaves ; " Poach them. Bob ble, or," she added, smitten with a sud den consciousness that she ought to help Bobble's housekeeping troubles if she could ; " look In Mrs. Beeton, dear." " Tibbs to gomg to alter your gown ; she wants the lace of your black bodice ; where Is It T* Mrs. Wentworth asked. " I read it in the newspapers, the ' Aus tralasian,' I think, mother." So they all pronounced Gay to be ln corrlgabte, and laid traps to make her talk nonsense by quickly changing the first unheeded question to one of differ ent import. When it followed, as a matter of course, that the first had by that time reached her absorbed senses and was answered. It caused mirth among them. Gwen was the only one of the three who had gone to school, and her coming back, had made a little stir and change In the home circle. Gay loved her deftrly, and admired her beyond measure. She was so lovely with her wealth of fair hair, her blue eyes�such sweetness in their depths�with the dark eyebrows and eyelashes, and hex) pale rounded cheek, where a fugitive blush now and then showed shell-pink in the smooth, creamy skin. It was the thought of Gwen that had startled Gay Into sudden wakefulness with the impulse of a duty to perform. 

 Remembering the state of her own girl hood, how she had spelt love in her un tried heart,when, alas ! it bore no such) impress, she felt that she must question her sister more closely, warn her of tha danger of a mistake, even confide in hep if necessary. It was the thought of the latter contingency which made her hesi tate and look back at her big bed; with a lingering desire to evade the self-im posed duty. Her bedroom was a large one, two rooms having been thrown into- one when she came home, a young wife, for at few months' visit before going for the tour round the world that Robert Stan hope had been trying to work himself up to make with her. The shadow of his presence had not lingered in this room; they had not brought his remains there; but it had been left for Mrs. Tibbs to suggest that it would be well to make some changes in the room. She had rear ranged it with the little shelves and con trivances of box ottomans from Gay's old bedroom and made half its length into a sitting-room. Bella Tibbs allowed no one to lay a hand on this room but herself ; she understood the arrangement that underlay the apparent disorder, and Gay never had to bemoan a book mis placed or a paper disturbed. Experience, like the cold, spray of ether, deaden* the illusions, but it hard ens- the character, though it may be toy imperceptible degrees. Gwen listened for awhile longer to the vague murmurs of awakening life, but Bhe was stern in her purpose. The clang of the station bell announcing < o'clock was the limit of indulgence she allowed herself. Gwen sat up in bed in sudden affright as Gay came and seated herself on the edge of her bed and roused her from her sleep. The girl opened her blue eyes wide, and drawing her knees up to her chin clasped her hands about them and stared wonderingly at Gay, with the sweet charm of a dream still upon her face. Her thick, long hair hung in a heavy plait over her shoulders; she twisted it round her wrists as she spoke. " What Is it, Gay ? Why are you up so early ?" she said. " Because I want to talk to you, dear," relied her sister, " and I thought�some how it seemed�that when you wake first in the morning�if there Is a little troubled doubt anywhere, it la then,it rushes into the brain. I want you, Owen, to ask yourself very seriously, if yon are quite sure of your love for Jack." " Sure of my love for him ? Oh, yes, Gay, indeed lam ! I thank God for It always, and ask Him to make me worthy of my dear boy. It is not wrong to ask Him to let Jack always love me, is it ? Because, you know, how can we expect to have things unless we pray for them V . " Tou feel like that about your love.?" Gay said with something of an awed wonder in her tone. " Then I dare *ay It is all right, and yon do truly love him. But still, think, dear, before Jack comes back to-day, or to-morrow, with Mr. David, suppose there should be trials and troubles In store for you, are you sure your love can stand the strain ? Thing* that are nothings with love are moun tains without It. If he should be a little careless, indifferent, not always so lover like as now " " I think you are doing Jack some mon strous Injustice," Gwen said in a disrni fled tone ; " I know I can trust him through everything, he Is so thorough- a gnntlpnwn. He never could do anything unkind and thoughtless." "God knows, dear, I don't want to instil the smallest doubt of Jack into your mind. I only ask you to think seriously, to be a? sure of yourself a* you are of Jack, and to realise how Httle you can know of your own nature at your age. Suppose, for Instance, that after a. few months of marrtare. you i?>io�ld come to realise that what you call l<we now Is only a liking that turns to wari ness. I don't speak to you as Br*>Me might: I have had my own experi " Yes, poor darling Gny ! I cwnnot tell you how often I have thousrM of your sorrow, since I have known haoo4 ness myself! I have won�l�r*d you didn't die when Robert wss killed !" Gay got up from the bed and paoed softly up and down the narrow room. Bhe did not wish to wake Bobble, whn sl^nt *n � "vtm off f?wen's, bnt she �n�ld not sit still any longer. She was in despair at the turn Gwen had given to her confession. She looked rather- a curious figure with her slender wNt� feet slipping about in a pair of bath slippers, her hands rolled up In her draw ing sown, and her loose hair taW** about her face. Her eyes burned with a curious Tight, that wss pathetic in Us earnestness as a torrent of words strwrgied for utterance. Yet What irrtod oonid she do though she shared her pain ful secret with another? "Only be true to him, Gwen: make Ms tastes and pursuits yours. Enter Into his life and feelings. Never dream that you are of different clay�that you can tire of his love, or tie of yours. Be worthy of all h!? affection." "I want to make myself worthy of nhn. Help me,' Gay; tell me how to lmnrme myself. But as to changing Irk my feel ings for him. that Is as imno�alW* as that the north wind should blow from the south !" "Good gracious !" exclaimed Bohhle, appearing in |the open doorw?y between the two rooms, "what's the meaning- of this early palaver?" Bhe held ut? fcer long nightgown daintily, and steooed with bare feet from one strip of carpet to another, then got Into Owen** *ed and -wrapped the bedclothes around J?er. "Continue," Bhe saM. "I'm not rning to be out In the cold, either figuratively or physically.'* " I suppose you would spell both th6se words with an ' V Bobble r* Gay said with a Uttle laugh. 

 " Why not ? lam not the slave of orthography !" " You are certainly not Its master," retorted Gay, glad to find the conversa tion had taken a turn. " Gay came in to talk to me about the responsibilities of my position. I dare cay, she meant it kindly, but I almost felt as if she had been throwing a sh shadow over my ha-happiness," said Gwen, her voice breaking tearfully. Gay looked the picture of. contrition. " Don't mind Gay," said Bobbie, " there's no harm in her. Give her a pen and a piece of paper, If she worries you, and tell her to put it.into rhyme," as you prefer it to ' reason' !" The threatened shower of tears passed, Gwen's lovely eyes resumed their seren ity, and the usual certainty that, she was meant of Providence to be petted and prosperous took possession of her, �o she led the talk to the momentous question of her trousseau, which was wont to absorb most of her- waking thoughts.
