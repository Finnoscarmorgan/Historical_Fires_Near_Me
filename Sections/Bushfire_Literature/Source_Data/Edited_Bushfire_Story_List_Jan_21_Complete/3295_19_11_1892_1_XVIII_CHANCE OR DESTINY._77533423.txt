CHAPTER XVIII. 

 CHANCE on DESTINY. 

 It is 11 moot point whether Chance or Des tiny control litmuui affairs. Perhaps tho two words mean the same, and events Avhich aro really sot down to chance have been predes tined from all time. If man ho a free agent it appears very curious that his whole life should be swayed and shaped by Home clianee event which In- never expected nor wished for; yet, if wo trace back the devious road of human life we will invariably find that the straight path on which wc started out from our cradle has at some part or another been suddenly blocked by some chance obstacle, and our course turned off at a tangent. 

 Sometimes we have nearly passed all the milestones on the journey of lif ; before this turning point is reached, -whilst frequently wo are hardly out cf sight of the cradle before we aro called upon to travel along a path very different from tlv.it mapped out i'or 

 us. 

 Wc are blind propers in the dark. A\\Te 

 cannot see tho distauco of our nose ahead 

 Avitli certainty, and every step forward we give leads us from the light of the present to the darkness of the future. No man can say what the morrow will bo. and, chance or destiny, which ever you like to call it, rules 

 our life. 

 John Hilton was a striking instance of this 

 assertion. 

 It was cither destiny or ehanco that threw him in the way of Magniro the bushranger, at tho " Travellers' Host " shanty, and tho 

 impulse which moved him to assist tho i attacked man -was responsible to a. great ex- i tent in shaping his future life- Maguire's well-meant present was to him u fital gift 

 in tho end, for it disturbed the (dear and : serene current of his life and filled the pr-riod 1 of hia declining years Avith trouble and gloom. 

 Previous to the posspr..�ion of tho paper giving a clue to the buried treasure* Ililion was an easy-going', contented man. Amidst, the: iill-absoriiing fever of the eavly gold discovcries, ho was content to ivinaiu on his 

 little farm at Carlsruho whilst other.} were 

 madly packing up and scampering* away to the il diggings," and it was nearly 10 years after the iii>l excitement had died a way that (more for a change than from a?iy motives of avarice) he decided to pay a short visit to Beudigo and try his luck at fossicking." 

 It was on this ill-starred journey that the momentous event of his life occur rod, and the 

 contented old man was transformed into a 

 restless, unhappy miser. 

 From the day ho left tho "Travellers' 

 Rest" lie never knew what it was to have a 

 contented mind, lie spent his waking mo ments in day-dreams and his sleep was visi ted with gorgeous visions of unbounded wealth. He had the Philosopher's Stone, so ho thought, in the blood-stained package the dving man had given him ; and tho golden dreams of his youth would be realised. 

 Like the Israelites in tho desert, when Moses left them, ho ceascd to worship tho true God and set up for himself a graven im ago of gold and, like them, his punishment 

 was swift and severe. 

 For a weary year ha sear-died unsuccess fully for the buried treasure, and when he found it in tho strange manner ho did when the fiery-cross shone before his eyes in the depth of the night-it was only to lose it the same day, and in a most unaccountable manner. Twice since that miserable day he had again visited the place where he had dis covered the gold, and spent days in vainly searching for it. 

 Now, 12 months after his first discovery and loss-ho was again camped in the narrow glen known as " Stringy-bark Gully," bent upon another search after the gold which he still fancied must be buried somewhere in the neighborhood. 

 He had pitched a small tent in the glade whero he first camped and, as the sun was sinking in the west, he sat with bowed head in front of a blazing firo he had made and looked at tho embers as if he would again find inspiration in their fiery characters. 

 Day disappeared and the long shadows be came merged in the general gloom, and still tho whito-huired old man sat with beut head and folded arms gazing intently at the 

 fire. 

 As tho night wore on ho began to talk aloud,as if lie were addressing an unseen com panion. 

 " The gold is mine hs muttcrfld. "Yes, mine. I must find it. Where can it be, x wonder ? What a fool I was to leave it as I did. I might have known it was not safe to go away for a moment from su<'h a prize ; 

 but I will find it yet. I was a. year search ing before I got* it at first, and it is just a 

 year now since I lost it. But J must sleep ; yes. sleep! for I wiii want a sharp eye to morrow ; and the tire tells me nothing!" As he finished talking ho glanced reproach fullv at the blazing logs, as if offended at them not suggesting tho whereabouts of the lost treasure, and then lie stood up find went 

 into the tent. 

 As the first streak of dawn broke in tho east he was astir and, after preparing a rough breakfast, he walked round the tent in an uncertain manner two or three times and then stood and retloctod. 

 '. The back- of the tent, which was cut down," he said aloud, " faced this way, so the thieves must have taken the gold out that way, and most likely they carried it further into the forest. They couldn't have re-buried it in the gullv, so I will take this direction to-day and try my luck," In.-concluded,look ing to the north and in the very direction tho gold had actually been taken. 

 With eager cyc-s ho carefully asccnded tho steep hill, seuuuiug the ground most minute ly. He reached the top and descended into the next gully,looking into every thicket and watching for the least signs of disturbed 

 earth. 

 On ho went, with the pertinacity of a sleuth-hound, and almost witii the same in stinct. He passed by the cultivated ground 

 on Sheridan's farm and round tho base of tho 

 Ilouud Ilill and into a deep glen on tho other side. This dark ravine looked a likely place for a plant," he thought, and he examined it with the greatest care. IIo was going cautiously throuyli some thick scrub when he nearly stumbled hit o a hole which was almost hidden by the long rank grass and luxuriant 

 creepers. 

 Saving himself with difficulty, lie got a long stick and, parting the vegetation which covered the hole, tried to ascertain its depth. Ho found it was not more than throe foot deep, and it had evidently been formed by tho up-rooting of a large tree, which had since bsen. destroyed by the numerous bush fires. 

 Using the stick vigorously, he broke away most of tho grass and creepers and then, kneeling down, struck a match to explore tho excavation, as thy thick undergrowth envel oped it in gloom. 

 For a few moments ho could distinguish nothing, but at last his eyes rested en a slight protruberanco at the bottom of tho hole on one side. Ho took up the stick and began poking at it, and in a few moments he felt something hard under the soft earth. AYitli a slight gleam of interest light iug up his hag gard face, the old man scooped away the debris, and as ho did so he found that the object he was feeling, whatever it might be, 

 was Avooden. 

 A feAV more thrusts with the. stick and the square outlines of a bo.x became visible and, unable to control his excitement, Hilton jumped into the hole Avith an agility beyond his years. 

 AVith a suppressed cry of terror, he clnm Ijerod out again with lightning-like-rapidity, 

 just in time to avoid tho dart of an enraged j 

 snake, which resented interference with its 

 llOine.
