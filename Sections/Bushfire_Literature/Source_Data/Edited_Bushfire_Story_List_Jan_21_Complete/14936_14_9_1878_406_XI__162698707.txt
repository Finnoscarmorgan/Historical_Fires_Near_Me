Mrs. Ord.

 [WKITTEN FOB THE ' SYDNEY MAIL.'] 

 Chapter XI. 

 'Mrs. Ord, sir.' Not at all an uncommon announcement. But there wag a tone in the servant's voice which made William look up with unwonted expectation. Myrhadyth was very much in. the habit of coming to him when she wanted help, or got into difficulties connected with her work for him through out the parish. But, with intuitive perception, he com prehended that this visit was for something more. Looking up, he was astonished. Myrhadyth stood there with a. flush on her cheek, a flash in her eye, a shy smile dimpling round her lips � perfected in her beauty, he thought. She 

 stood silent for a few seconds, as if irresolute. Then what she said was, faltering slowly. ' I � came to � tell you � something � about myself.' He saw she was trembling with excitement, and rose to- place her in a seat. ' All about yourself interests me, Mrs. Ord. You know it does.' ' Oh, yes,' with a sigh of relief ; 'you have been so good. Ymi have been kind when I deserved no kindness. You will not think me foolish now. I was coming home front Evansgrove last night' (with a rapid transition), 'Mr. Stronach, do you know what Mr. Grant is to me?' ' To you specially ? No, Mrs. Ord, I thought you were as much a stranger as myself.' 'He is my � dead husband's brother. Ho � oh, he does not know me. If he did, he � I think he would curse me. He would drive me away from Bertha, I am sure ; and I, I am getting to love Bertha, just when I must leave her.' ' Must leave her ! Go on, Mrs. Ord.' ' I wa6 there, with Bertha ; I went to teach her an old tapestry stitch. I am going again to-morrow. Mr. Grant was at home, and he looked so like my own that � that � oh, if I had not governed myself I would have fallen at his feet, and wept, and� rentreated his_ pardon.' William's hasty gesture was one of impatience. When people get into such false positions as had Myradyth, they must expect to be mistaken, often suspected, even by those that love them. ' His pardon ?' She recognised the situation, and answered meekly, ' My husband's death lies at my door, and he is my husband's brother.' ' I see. Well !' He never by word or act sympathised with her morbid self-condemnation. She continued, ' But there was a hard glitter in his eye that warned me back. And, while I was thinking in this way, he suddenly asked me if I knew any Mrs. Grant in Lilburne. I was so confounded, that I could hardly speak] but I managed to answer, carelessly, that I did not.' William's lips compressed. He frowned and spoke out bluntly, ' Falsehood, Mrs. Ord.' She blushed. 'I don't excuse it. I had no time to think. He said ' she is my brother's wife, and I am anxious, to find her for family reasons. If you hear of such a person will you let me know. You are so much about among the people.' I promised to do so, but I could not feign the amount of interest which would have been natural as to bis ignorance of the whereabouts of so near a relative, or why he thought her in Lilburne. I have not the slightest idea how he can have suspected me to be here, and I should think he might naturally, also, suspect my identity from my conduct last night.' William reflected for a few moments. 'Mrs. Ord, I can't make out any real reasons why^you should not mako yourself known to these relations ?' She answered with a bitter laugh, ' If Bertha knew me, with her father's version of my history, she would hate me. And Evan does not seek me with friendly feelings. He would rather learn that I was dead. What am I to him ? ? No, the best I can do is to leave him in possession of what was Owen's, untroubled even by the thought that I have any power to claim it 3 ' William started. A flood of new light burst upon his mmd. '.Your husband's property ; you are not in posses* ? sion of-your husbond'6 property, Mrs. Ord ?' ' I know nothing about it,' she said, ' I want to know nothing about it. I was as dead. I want to be as dead.' ** But � but Mr. Grant knows you are not dead ?' She stammered somewhat. ' It was for his own sake ; I always let him know that. I did not want him to do � any- thing (anythingwrong, you know) under theidea that I was � ' Then you had some idea that he might do wrong ?' 'No, no.' But she spoke dubiously. 'I never knew him do wrong. But I did not know what the law might be,, and I did not want him to injure himself.' 'I see, self-renunciation run wild. I beg your pardon \\, Mrs. Ord; I should not have said that. But' really your notions of right stagger me. Let me ask, did your husband; leave no will �'' ' I don't know. I know nothing. I want to know nothing,' she impatiently said. He had not thought Myrhadyth Ord could be so petulent, but she was develop ing many womanly qualities just now � this among them. ' But'� William began. She interrupted him. ' Mr. Stronach, don't torture me ; I was not my husband's true wife in any righteous sense of the word. Law-tied is not love-tied. But love is God's bond. What real title had I to what was his '(' 'But who had it?' ?' Why, his brother, I suppose. I never knew certainly. Evan is his nearest relative, and the younger brother, Walter, died just at the time of our marriage.' ?' Mrs. Ord,' said William impressively, ' if you will not consider yourself, you ought to consider your child. If she should be found, how would this affect her interest ? ' She moved uneasily in her seat. ' I have enough for her. If I could find her, I would find enough for her needs. If only I could find her� if only I could find her. If Mrs Bowles knows any more^ ? ' ' Mrs. Bowles ! ' He thought her brain was wandering, and moved towards her. ' Did you not hear what she said that day ? ' 'That day? What day?' Mrs. Ord found that she had to repeat the old nurse's chatter, word for word, before he could understand her, which she did very unwillingly. Then, indeed, he began to think seriously. Men do not commonly take notice of particulars of feature. la that, as in other things, men generalise where women individualise, jgrt yet something kept Giftie's face before his mind all thTtune Myrhadyth was speaking, and some of the fancies he had at* the time of Elsie Christie's death, returned. Impatient in his turn, he inquired 'why did you not question her then .?' 'I4�uldn*t. I was afraid of betraying myself.' ' Why, what do youfearr* Myrhadyth shivered. ' I love my child, but if anyone discovered me I might have to stand at the bar of justice for having hated it so much that I cruelly deserted it. I Might find her, so that her first thought of .her mother Again he~ started. He thought he had considered Mrff� Ord's case from every point of view, but this, of her being accused legally of deserting her child, had not struck him* He had to think about it now. - Myrhadyth continued wearily. ' But I did not corns here to tell you all this. I came to 6peak about niyielf.* Spoken as if the woman she had been talking of was a third person. It struck him that she often did so consider her self of the past as if it was a person distinct from her. **e did not wonder at it. Yet he dreaded an error therefrom, and that led him to remark. ' We cannot separate ourselves from the things of the past. We may drop the chain, out we will find that we only drag it, and that the links are well She looked up, surprised at his hard tone. ' I know that. 

 ?n~ho pould know it better. But it docs not help me much. 1 walked eo hopelessly away from Evansgrove. It seemed L if mv sin was for ever following me, and wrapping me in ts shadow. * thought that now I must leave Lilburae, or be ' \\ioted to all my friends as the wretch I am. For that I am ture jS what Evan Grant will do. And then in the depth of mv despair, hope came. I was passing Holtscroft, where the trees were all so blackened last summer by the bush fire. ?They stood up, you remember, in bare, grotesque outlines, nuito charred. ' You said they reminded you of some of Xante's imprisoned souls in Purgatory, Well, Mr. Stronach, Jhev ^q now wreathed from top to bottom with delicate ceon growth and pink, pearly leaf-buds, as soft as the Summer �n *he iss&e �* some beautiful shell. Oh, suck hie out of the very body of death. And it spoke a strange thing to me. It seemed to say that even out of death might life laugh for me.' 'Even out of death life shall always come,' William observed reverently. ' No atom exists in vain. Even the mouldering stone has in it the element of the sentient soil. Qoi has made the type everywhere. It is for us to find the SBti-tVpP-' '?Yes,' she replied, answering the thought he had not nut in*0' distinct wor^s- 'I meant soul -life, and I trod more gladly h�mei an(^ went to sleep easily in spite of my Zgj_]exjty. Then I dreamed � was it by chance ! � I dreamed lhat I stood gazing along a lonely road. I was at a dead stand �tjll so tired I could neither advance nor return. Not that I had any will to return. I thought that I had ceine far, over j^Hphaud rugged places. My feet were bleeding and my limbs were sore. I was hungry and thirsty. And there was no rest that I could see. My heart and bedy ached, but I felt that I could rather lie down and die where I stood than retrace a single step of that dreadful road. I Jooked before jne. Isawtheroad but a little way, for a leaden mist barred the path. I was fainting, falling. I thought to -ye. Then, slowly, a rosy light began to Mush the dull grey mist and it increased until a form began toshow in its midst, ?and approached me, surrounded by an atmosphere of warmth and light. A loving face, outstretched anas, a thorn-crowned i noble head pierced hands and side, bare way-worn feet, but j raiment glistening white as snow. I know him well, and, : when the edge of that halo of brightness touched me, a ; power that was not my own came into me, and I sped forward ,' Trith new strength, and fell into the arms that were open to ! receive roe. Even as I did so, I became aware that we two ? were not alone. On either side he 2ed-ene, and when I saw 1 knew them � the worn-visaged man and 6light, fair, child. All at once, out of the midst of mydostitution, I was royally rich. I had all� my Saviour, my iiasband, and my child, and I was blest.' Myrhadyth ceased and was silent, weeping quietly from restrained feeling. William hardly aiow what to say. In spite of his reason, he was affected by 'her, eloquent recital. It would have been cruel to remind her, just then, that she had told him her husband was nota'Chnstian, and that her child was far more likely to have fallen into evil than into good hands. At last he remarked .gently, ' the Lord can. make it all come true, Myrhadytk.' She smiled through her tears, ' I think it is a promise that He trill.' ?* ' In heaven,' he suggested cautiously. ' Or even here. But it promised more, Mr. Stronach.' Again he was startled. He had ?positively let the highest thing slip away from him in the human interest of the dream. She had not.. His face .flushed not with self reproval. ' That is what I came to say.' And again the blood flew up her face, and, hiding it in her hands, she burst into a passionate cry, ' I can repent, I can repent. Christ is rowing through the mist and .the 'darkness ; I can see His face, as' it nears me, ever more and more tender as I look. His own hand unlocks the door ihat ibarred His way � my hard despair is gone. The blackened, fire-scathed tree will bloom with fresh, new foliage. I am � I am the Lord's, in spite of all my sin !' And, sobbing violently, she fell, exhausted with emotion, forward on her seat. It will not sully William's manhood to say that his eyes were full of tears. All he spoke was a quiet ' Thank God !' :as she sobbed herself into more self-control. Then she rose, and said solemnly, ' I must go and look for my baby now.' ? ' What do you mean ? ' ' I can't stop here ; I must leawe Lilburne. 1 ani strong, mow ; I will go and look for her.'' He meditated. Perhaps it weuld be best. It was her ?duty, he thought, and donfctlese she would be blessed in doing it. So he asked, ' What do you propose to do ?' ' I'll see first what Mre. Bowles says. I will go to Erangrove now and see her. ' ' Good,' William said, ' but I think, Myrhadyth, you had better let me question her. I will excite less suspicion. I cannot be supposed to have any .'personal interest in the matter, -while Mr. Grant might be led to suspect you. I will find out all she knows depend on it, wthout implicat ing you.' ' And about my husband ?' 'Yes, aWshe can tell. I will .go instantly. Let aunt Dozic find you a bed, Mre. Ord. Be obedient, for once,' he added, smiling, as she showed signs of opposition. ' I will,' she said, smiling in her turn. 'I am very tired. I will, and thank you.' _ And, calling Miss Dozie to sttend his almost fainting visitor, William got into his great coat, at his aunt's wise suggestion, and started on a rather late walk to Evans igrove. Chapter XII. On the road to Evansgrove William Stronach passed Holtscroft. He regarded Myrhadyth's natural miracle, as it shone through the moonlight, with great interest. Per naps, to all other beings Holtscroft presented just a pretty *hp of bushland where the trees were recovering from the �ffecte of a fire, but to him and Myrhadyth it would ever be God's letter of recall to an estranged spirit. Bertha met him in the hall, answering with a slight curiosity to his inquiry for Mrs. Bowles. ' She is gone.' 'Gone!' Bertha laughed outright at his concerned tone. ' I am not to be an invalid forever. If you had not all been so set on coddling me, she would not have been here so long, lwo months is long enough, in all conscience, for a silly girl to keep such an expensive attendant about her, just because �ae tumbled down and broke her head. She went away yesterday. I hope none of our friends are ill, that you are Reeking her.' ' No, I wished but to speak to her. You can give mo heraddress.' . 'Well, really, no, Mr. Stronach, I can't; I don't know where she lives, and, I suppose it is ungrateful, but I was not sufficiently attached to her to ask ? ' ' S?* whwe did Mr- Grant get her ? ' She was nursing Mrs. Thorpe. Papa had just hap pened to lunch the day before with Mr. Thorpe� papa's Partner, you know� and had heard that Mrs. Thorpe was oetter, and her nurse leaving that day. He iust went and fetched her away.' Jj But where did Mrs. Thorpe get her ? ' (l * am not sure. I think through Dr. ? ' .Ah, well, I must inquire further. My business is of no ^immediate moment.' �, ' ' ^r' Stronach, if it is a fair question, why in all kno � d d� you want Mrs' Bowles ? I am so curious to He laughed gaily. -' I dare say. Why what a child **: ?re, Miss Bertie.' William Stronach mocked merrily at Bertha Grant's yano&ty, but in his walk home, he felt the very same feel ltSi &AfediaS strange to the experience of all his life before. , 'Ha strong hold of him now, however, and he knew not 'ow it quickened his step, until he stood breathless in his *��y. He went hastily to an old desk which he always fit? .^folly locked, and from thence he selected a clumsily folded parcel, and looked long and thoughtfully at i?- ^'Pbon written in crabbed characters on the outside, ^.fingers trifled several times about the heavy dabs of '''jog-wax that fastened it clumsily with -white tape, but, *&**? reading the writing, he smiled, sighed, and locked the P�*et away again. He had made some resolve, but yet his ?nina -was disturbed, and after many ineffectual attempts at sniay, he rose and went to his accustomed seat m the �* i v Giftie 'dready had possession there, with her jcnool-books scattered upon the table. He was wearied and 'f' dreaming, he sat quietly back in his chair, and under *'8 screening hand, examined the child's face unperceived. now wonderfully she had changed in the past six months. lf^a?pearance Pow was m(^ M might have more probably *�ecn mat of a child reared rather in a higher than a much 

 lower sphere than thatof the quiet manse life. Dressed in a closely-fitting dress of red merino, and a white pinafore, which' Myrhadyth's hands had.fashioaed, and decked with pretty trimming, her fair close curls held back by a narrow ribbon that matched her dress in colour, she was in appear ance and manner a minature lady. The outlines of both face and form had rounded a little with better living, and her complexion was no longer sun-tanned. Very fair was the small pensive face, very meek the droop of the long dark lashes over the blue eyes. ' But William, with keen percep tion of character, was wondering what meant the clearly cut, firm curves of her beautiful mouth, and the delicate squareness of her small dimpled chin. Determination, he thought, withasinvle. Would this small thing evercause him trouble, he woadered, or would she be as soft and tractable as Bertha! Bertha! And,|oh wonderful human heart ! the fairy form and gentle face was all he thought of thenceforth. Myfhadytia's sworn knight � fall, too, at that moment of a certain fealty to her cause � actually surrendered himself for the restof that rest-time to the analisatioq of the mean ing of Bertha's blushes in her interview with him that evening. Coming back, for a moment, with a jerk of self disgust, to the contemplation of Giftie's face, when, with an upliftp&:glance of appeal, she asked him a twice-repeated question. Just then the light flashed against the dark spot inher'e--e,'and, his mind recurring to Mrs. Bowles' state ment, ihe -started.. But it was night, and he was not sure. A woman would have turned her to the lamp and satisfied herself � this man was content with the resolution that he ?would examine her eyes in the morning. While he thu6 determined, Giftie remarked. ' I must go to Miss Bertha, in the morning, if I may. She promised to teach me how to crochet, and I can't spare time from my lessons, except on Saturday. May I go, Mr. Stronach ? ' '' Surely, my child.' She held up her face, then for the common good-night kiss with which he had fallen into the paternal habit of ?closing her day. Taking her little face between his two hands, he bestowed the caress tenderly, and in doing it, his lips touched on a tiny spot that was not yet quite smooth. ' What's that ?�' He looked closely, ' Oh nothing. It's always there !' Was it only a coincidence If so, how. remarkable ! But after all such remarkable coincidences took place every day. You read in some uncommon verse to-day a word you never saw before in the course of half a lifetime. A. hundred chances to one you read the same in a -superficial article on sewerage to-morrow. You contemplate earnestly thishour the statement of a fact that never engaged your attention before : by next post you shall get a long letter from your dearest friend discusing the same fact in its every bearing. Some soul in Jeddo, thirsty for notoriety, commits a, murder, witib. circumstances of such refined atrocity, that your heart bums and freezes by turns as you con its recital. While your nerves are yet tingling, another batch of news brings particulars of that crime's very duplicate, perpetrated by a fine lady in Paris. Coincidences happen every moment. So argued William, when Giftie kissed him and went to bed, and returned to his contemplation of Bertha's roses. He intended to eee Myrhadyth next day. He would take that curious packet with him, and know what it contained before another night closed over him. Ay, he would. What had Elsie Christie to communicate to Myrhadytn ? How did she know tiiat Myrhadyth would not sing that hymn on the night elie did 'i Did all this concern Giftie ? If Giftie should really be the child that was so yearned for ! He could hardly wait until morning. But Myrhadyth was tired, and asleep now. He would not wake her � time enough in the morning. Man proposes, but God disposes. When next morning came Mr. Stronach was moused from his bed at daybreak by a pressing call to a wretched deathbed, beside which mere human pity kept him until late at night. Meantime Giftie paid her visit to Evansgrove, and was taught to. crochet, and Myrhadyth Ord rose, recruited by sleep, and went to her own home. It was becoming quite a common thing for Bertha to keep this graceful chUd with her from Saturday to Monday � she did it now. Even Mr. Grant liked to 6ee Bertha with the gentle child at her side, and Balph � although it would have been too much to expect him to give up his prerogative of torturing every creature he came across � had been heard to declare that ' if that there kid with the queer name only wanted a case of wood-bugs, guess she'd get it � every one pinned alive, too.' Mr. Stronach came home from that sorrowful death-bed sad. He had 6een the eternal crinimal go into the court to face an Eternal Judge. Solemn sight V Full of it he stood on the Sabbath morning to face the people. Ah, if he could have told them all that Mb soul had seen. But a message had come to him in the night ,* at least he could deliver it. ' ' The soul that sinneth it shall die.' I am not pre pared, my people, to discuss my text with its context. The thought of the text dwells heavily upon my soul. I would that I could lay it as heavily upon yours. The words are God's words, not mine. The idea, reiterated as it is in Scripture, is God's, not mine. God speaks, not I ! hear Him. Oh, my people, over whom my soul yearns, in dim symbolism of His yearning over you, hearing me, will ye hear Him. ' The soul that sinneth it shall die.' God uttered it with grave warning hi Eden. Man heard and rejected it. The consequences are upon us. We inherit man's nature. We listen and do not believe. God's loud voice of many waters roared it through the flood, and whispered it into the ears of the sheltered ones within the Ark. It was thundered from Sinai. It was groaned forth from Calvery. Still we do not believe � practically we do not believe. Man of wealth � we say to you ' the soul that sinneth it shall die ?' Without despising your riches we point you to the narrow grave, in which you have seen your fellows again and again laid down. We tell you to j udge for yourself. We dare you to deny that you also will lie in the same manner low. Yourcoffi* may be of precious wood, your shroud may be of fine linen, your stony brow may be pillowed on down, your coffin may be filled with spices, your pall may be of gpla, your monument may be marble, your epitaph may be fulsome. And yet, what of it. The coffin rots, the stone moulders, the words of flattery are forgotten, the body resolves itself into clay. But this remains ? the soul that sinneth it shall die.' Man of mind ; man whom we reverence and respect � thy brain* is full of noble thought. Thou dost love and. honour mankind, and would fain lift it to thine own high level. Thou art lavish of thy precious things, thou dost labour to lift man from grovelling in the dust of passion. Noble aim ! Yet thou also shall be with in the narrow home, and, in future ages, others of thy glorious fraternity shall occupy mens' minds, and thou shalt be seldom mentioned with a passing eulogy. But for thee, also it is spoken � ? the soul that sinneth it shall die.' Labouring man ! Man of hardened hand and weary limbs ! Life itself gives thee no great thing. If thou axiJUled with thoughts for the things of this life, -what marvel. Bread is hard to win, and is paid for by many an ache of sinew and pang of heart. Toil is they lot and thy children's lot. True, work is no evil in itself. But there are two different things, thou dost know, the theoretic statement of this truth, and its practical exemplifications. If thou art concerned only with the things of the body, who shall blame thee. Yet remember thou that it was the carpenter, the working-'nan who spoke�' The soul that sinneth it shall die.' Frivol ous woman. Creature of froth and flash, shallow of brain and narrow of heart, -whose feeling is impure, green like the slime that flourishes upon the rock, whose heart the rock may well resemble. Thou who dost stifle time to death -with frippery, and dance and babble thyself into Eternity, for thee also in this word spoken ' The soul that sinneth it shall die.' And for thee, too, woman of tender heart and pure steadiness of soul. The heart is full of the intensity of life. Thou dost love and art loved. Thy children cling to thee, and, in glad contact, imbibe thy purify. We, looking upon thee, see but thy sweetness and thy good ness, yet for thee is the word spoken � '.The soul that sinneth it shall die.' And, tempted one, to whom sin is beckoning with alluring gesture. The way before thee is rosy, the goal before the shines golden, but thou dost see the White Hand from the heavens, whose confronting palm motions the back. Hear thou, also, the pealing voice � ' The soul that sinneth it shall die.' God then looketh to the souFs state, let the body and its surroundings be what it will. And � appalling thought ! � unless we can plead sinlessness � He includes all souls in one terrible entirety�' The soul that sinneth it shall die,' and that soul is the soul of all mankind. How Bfcall we escape? Can we escape? There is no escape. Let the soul die. We have all sinned, and there is never a ransom. Ah, but there is a ransom. Let the soul die. As Jesus, our Ransom, is man of men, so is He the Soul of all souls. Sufficient He, in Almighty sinfulness, to fake up and bear the burden of all sin. All He asks� 

 all we ask for Him� is Itt the curse be fulfilled. Let Him die, and receive ye the boon of the substitute, each for himself. And again, let the soul die. Merge ye all that is soul in you, affections, thoughts will, in Him, and die that ye may live. My people, oh. my people, I lost night saw one ful fil 'for himself the awful sentence. I saw a soul die into undying eternity with nointerestin a dyingSaviour. I saw it Ilq naiad into the burning atmosphere that surrounds a Holy Gid. How will it be vrilhycu, and you, and you in the same strait ? How shall it be with me.' Myrhadyth drew a long agonised breath as he finished. Giftie smiled. Bertha and Miss Dozie looked content. He saw all that, as he road the following hymn, and he glanced, with glad trust, after these and several others, as they filed with a took of loving reluctance out of the place of worship. Giftie went through the door with her hand slipped into Mrs. Ord's, and both cast back a smiling glance at him. The sweet fair child, he thought, how well in place bhe looked clinging to tliat gentle holy woman. That night, if he were spared, he would see Myrhadyth ah! if he had known, when that little bright figure passed out at that door, how long � how bitterly long � it would be before his ?eyes rested upon her, how her little limbs would ache, and her gentle heart be torn, ere he again saw her, how carefully he would have detained her. But Inscrutable Providence ?does only slowly, very slowly, roll up the curtain from the stage of our future, and such knowledge might not be.
