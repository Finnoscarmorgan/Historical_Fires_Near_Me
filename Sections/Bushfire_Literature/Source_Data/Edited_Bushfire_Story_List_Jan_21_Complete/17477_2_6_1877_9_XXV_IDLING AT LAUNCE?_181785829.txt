'Toeing tho .brook' upwards, you 'tramplo tiirougn long'grass/wild briari'and 'shrubs in which the silver wattle, and the Lombardy poplar grow.in beauty side by side; rind amongstwhich Anderton Bbsorved a inarsh?niallow flourish ing as a tree two feet higher than himself : you reach tho' time-worn dripping mill-wheel, which'the'stream turns in its passage from the parent dam 1,300 feet above tho sea level. ' l The road after this' holt still continued over the valley, and' through quiet English village, scenery. Here was ft closely' clipped hedge of sweet-briar, at least ten feet high, and six feet through; there stood, rustled by the passing breeze, and warm in tho afternoon sun; shocks of full-earedwheat. Now there were ricks of corn, affdnowdark-brownricks of silver wattle bark; sleekBerkebirepigs, rooting in the stubble; grey rocks pushing themselves outward'to remind you'that'basalt country will produce a crop of its own';in spite of high cultivation, h1 the villago of St. Leonard's turkeys gobbled in tbe street, and children mado mud-pics on tho edge of the pavement. It was thoroughly English, save and 'except the vast white pyramids of sihoke indicating bush fires in tho further •mountain range. . • ] Cora Linn is a wild and imjposing ravino, .a. "deep rocky gorge, through which the North Esk madly rushes. , The rocks, some of which stand pulpit-like out of the foaming-flood, are ridsfc fantastic in shapo; and the platforms and. .terraces of rock on either sidc^ of the bridge afford you 6tdnding;pointsl from . which many strikingly, contrasting views may' be obtained.
