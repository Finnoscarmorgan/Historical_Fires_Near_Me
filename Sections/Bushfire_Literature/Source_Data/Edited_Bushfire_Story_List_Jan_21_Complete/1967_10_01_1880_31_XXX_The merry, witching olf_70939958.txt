 " That place of Simmons's is a disgrace to tho township. I saw another girl, a stranger, behind the bar to-day." 

 This remark was mado by tho doctor to his family about two year's after Sydney's marriago, and he spoke petulantly. Tho moral ruin that had emanated from Simmons's glaring den of temptation, was a sore spot in the doctor's mind, 

 and in more minds than his. 

 "I saw her," remarked Geraldine, "asd strangely enough her face seems familiar to me, although I can't recollect seeing her anywhere.' 

 " She's a perfect stranger, I hear, poor thing." 

 It was tho middle of a dry, hot summer, and there wero bush fires in every direction. Tho doctor's family sat upon tho vorandah later than usual, n.nd at last, reluctantly separating, Sydney and Dorrie crossed the garden to their own home. 

 Geraldine could not sleop. The heat opprossed her, and she was more than commonly sad. That day a wonderful piece of news had reaohed them. Red Dick had beon arrestad two or three weeks before for horsoutealing, and in tho prison conaci once had asserted itself, and ho had repented of his past life. Now, through all tho napers was resounding tho man's confession, which substan tiated all Sydney's statementc, and left his char acter olear of overy stain. 

 Geraldine's heart was boating madly, and not all the pressure of her hot hands upon it could still the throbbing. Her eyes were full of deep, tonder light, hor lips were parted, panting with joy; Sydnoy was no longer the punished felon; he was but an unjustly used man. And did she not know John Vernon well ; did she not know that, as Burely aB they both lived the morrow would find her his betrothed wife. And oh, was evor heart BO glad, so glad. 

 Musing thus oho sat at her opon window far into tho night. All was still. But onee she saw, or thought oho saw, a dark figure cross the garden towards her brother's house. "Tush," she laughed, " I am so excited ; it �B only the shadow of the old poplar tree." 

 Scarcely a quarter of an hour after that her attention was forcibly called by a sudden great burst of light from the window of her brother's 

 kitchen. 

 Ono moment's pause of horror, and a leap of the light to greater size, and comprehension broke upon her. She flew through tho house like a shot, rattling her father's door, to cry, " Father, Sydnoy's houae �B on fire," out to tho Btablos to wake the men and bid thom give the alarm, then wildly across the garden towards the fire. 

 Two or three men were there already, doing what they could, but water waa soarce, and the fire flew through the wooden building. It waa apparent that nothing could be done. 

 Geraldine would have rushed into tho house but 

 Roger, who had come up by this time, pointed to where Sydney carno out carrying Dorrie faint ing in hie arms. 

 But Geraldine gave utterance toa loud cry. " The baby, the baby." 

 " Doubtless, the nurso has it," said some one, soothingly. 

 But here tho nurse pressed tremblingly for ward. " Mary and I got out at the window, but the mistrosa had the baby." 

 "God help me," groaned Sydney, "she was lying with us." 

 They managed to hold back the frantic father, but Geraldine cast off all hands and flow towards tho house. At the same moment a tall figuro sprang from among the fast-gathering crowd, and closely followed her. They both passed through tho hall door, although tho Sames were lapping all ono aide of the hall. Tho bedroom waa on the other, and both got into it safely. Geraldine reached tho bed and snatohed up the suffocating child, but even as eho did so, the flames burst with a great shriek through the back wall, and played round her and it. Sho fell, but it was into John Vernon'� arms. One rapid glance round. There was no escape but tho front window. With a mighty blow of his arm ho dashed out the sash put out the girl and child, and Bprang clear himself just aa the roof fell in behind him. 

 Suoh a shout as rose at tho gaUant deed's ouc cessful consummation. But it lulled immedi ately when it became evident that all three of the naved must be carried away insensible. They were taken, of course, to tho doctor's houso, and poor Dr. Stone found his hands full at 

 onoe. 

 Thc baby was soon recovered. It had received no burn, for in tho instant of snatching it, the thoughtful girl, who had paid such a prico to Bavo it, had enveloped it completely in the 

 blanket. 

 John Vernon was slightly scorched, and, more over, had the bono of tho foroarm broken by tho blow he had given the window sash. Nevertheless, in a couple of hours, ho waa so far reoovered aa to bo able to go to Geraldine's bodsido. 

 But she, tho unselfish, the noble-hearted girl, was dying. Sho had been badly burnt, and, not only that, but the higly-ntrnincd nervous system had givon way beneath the shock. Thero she lay pale, beautiful, smiling, quite oonscious, but lifo was fast ebbing away. 

 Dorrie knelt by her Bid�, sobbing heartbrokenly. " If I had been less foolish, if I had been brave liko you, I should not have faintod, and Sydney would have saved her. Oh, Jerrio, my oister, I have killed you." 

 " No, darling, bush. It was God's will. I am so glad she is safe. Where is mother ?" 

 " Here, my own girl." 

 " Mother, dear, you'll miss me. But I'll wait for you in Heaven. Kisa me, mother." 

 Poor Mrs. Stone 1 They camed her away, and laid her down and darkened the room. God came to her, and Bhe wa3 oalm under the blow. 

 "Father, Sydney. He is a good son, father. Lot him take my place." 

 " None will over take your place, dear lovo. But I thank God that brought him to me." 

 *' I'll never let him want a son, dear Geraldine. Oh, my Bister, can'tyou stay, can't you rally." 

 But here the doctor puRhed him > away. For John Vernon carno to hor aide, and delicately they all stolo out of tho room. 

 Geraldine lifted eyes as soft as a baby's, and motioned hor lips up to kiss him. 

 " My John," she whispered. 

 "Mine," ho said, bitterly, as belaid his hand on her glossy head. " Mine now, dear love, when it is too late. Oh, if you had been mine before, I should havo had yon away." 

 "And Sydney's baby would have been burnt. No, no, John. Don't regrot the pri�e of her sal 

 vation. It's best so. Teaoh the little dove to know the Saviour." 

 And he hold her in his arma, and caressed and kissed her for one short half hour, 

 Then abo whispered very low. " It won't be hong. I'd like to see the baby." 

 Dr. Stone carno to her side, and looked uadly on her. " No, it won't b� long until you are in Hea ven, dear." 

 And they brought tho little child to her and laid it on tho bed bosido her. She played with its golden rings of hair with weak uncertain fin gers, eoo'd a little to it, sang a lino or two of a baby hymn, smiled whon it Btroked her cheok with its little soft palm. 

 Then she said suddenly, " Dorrie, take her," gave one comprehensive loving look round, which stayed on John Vernon's anguished face, with an evpressaon of intenso pity. Then slowly she raised her two arma towards Heaven, said slowly, " Now, my own Saviour, I come," drew a long, sighing breath and was gone. 

 Next morning, the mon soarching among the ruins of Sydnoy Knox's house, found in tho pan try tho charred body of a woman. She seemod to have rushed in there to escape tho forco of the fire, but it had no exit, and she could not return, and had unavoidably perished thore. But who was she F Thoy brought to Sydney a ring with a rod stone in it, and letters insido "J.F. toF.Y." Sydney started, but ho said nothing. Only, in a conversation with Dr. Stone over tho body, he uttered these words-" She showed it to me the morning Jim gave it to her, and I advised her to have nothing to do with him, but send it back." 

 And the new barmaid at Simmons's was miss 

 ing. That was all. Thore was evidenco enoc gh in the kitchen that the house had been wilfully 

 set on fire. 

 So patsed from earth Geraldine Knox, tho beau tiful, the. good young evangelist, as ahe was in all her sweet life. Graves are moet dwellings for suoh as she; and beneath white violets, and ten der bells of snowflakes, sleeps all that earth can keep of Geraldine. 

 The one sweet romance of Mrs. Stone's now thoroughly invalided lifo, is when her saddened husband finds time to lead her to Geraldine's grave, and together they talk of the Heaven in which they shall behold her again, and for ever. 

 THE END.
