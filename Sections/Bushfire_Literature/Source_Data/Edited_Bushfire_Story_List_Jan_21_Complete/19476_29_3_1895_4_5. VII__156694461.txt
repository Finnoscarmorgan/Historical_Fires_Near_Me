 THE VALLEY OF THE VA8SE. VII. 

 The Convict's Pass. ' Ngarra-jil ?' said Hamerton. Mr. Wyyille smiled and nodded. fI thought it jnsfc as well to know . where the man passed the night,' he said. A few minutes later, Ngarra-jil came to the verandah, and spoke in his own language to Mr. Wyville, who was much disturbed by the message. He wrote a letter, and sent it instantly to the post office. 

 ' The callous wretch,' he said, un usually moved. He had just learned that the man had gone straight to Draper, by whom he had been hired to get the pass. Draper's purpose was plain. He intended to leave the colony, and desert again his most unfortunate wife, with whose money he could return comfortably to England. ? ' What will you do with the mis creant ?' asked Hamerton. 'Nothing, but take the pass from him.' ' But he is a free man. Can you in terfere with his movements 7' ? No man is allowed to desert his wife, after stealing her property. He can feave a pass by asking ; but he dare not come here for it. And yet, I fear to keep him ; he may do worse yet. If no change for the better appear, I shall hasten his departure, and alone, on .our return from the Vasse.' 

 VIII. THE BUSH-FIRE. 

 It was the afternoon of a day of op pressive heat on which Mr. Wyville and Hamerton started from Perth to ride to the mountains of tho Vasse^ They were lightly equipped, carrying with them the few necessaries for the primitive life of the bush. . For weeks before, the air had been filled with an irritating smoke, that clung to the earth all day, and was blown far inland by the sea-breezes at night. 

 As the horsemen were leaving Perth, they met a travel-stained police-trooper, carrying the mail from the southern dis tricts. He recognised the Comptroller General, and saluted respectfully as he passed. ? Where is the fire, trooper V asked Mr. Wyville. ' In the Bunbury district, sir, and moving toward the Vasse Road. It has burnt on the plains inside the seahills for three weeks, and in a day or two will reach the heavy bush on the nplands.' They rode at a steady and rapid pace, conversing little, like men bent on a long and tedious journey. The evening closed on them when they were crossing the Darling Range. From the desolate mountain-road, as they descended, they saw the sun standing, large and red, on the horizon. Bofore them, at the foot of the range, stretched a waste of white sand, far as the eye could reach, over which their road lay. The setting of the sun on such a scene has an awfulness hard to be described. The whiteness of the sand seems to in 'crease until it becomes ghastly, while every low ridge casts a black shadow. During this time of twilight the sand has a weirdly sombre aspect. When the night comes in its black shroud cr sil very moonlight, tho supernatural effect is disnellcd. 

 As the travellers rode down toward the plain, impressed by this ghostly hour, Mr. Wyville called Hamerton's attention to two dark objects moving on the sand at a distance. Hamerton unslung his field-glass, and looked at the objects. ' A man and a woman,' he said ; ' they are going ahead, and the woman carries a load like the natives. Soon after, the sun went down beyond the desert, and the plain was dark. The horsemen spurred on, oppressed by the level monotony before them. They had forgotten the travellers who were cross ing the weary waBto on foot. Suddenly Hamerton's horse swerved, and a voico in tlio darkness ahead shouted something. It was a command from tho man on foot, addressed to the woman, who, in her weariness and with her burden, had not been able to keep pace with liirn, and had fallen behind. ? Come along, curse you ! or I'll be all night on this pl�in.' Tho speaker had not seen or heard tho horsemen, whose advance was hidden by the night and the soft sand. They rode close' behind the woman, and heard her labored breathing as she increasod her speed. A senso of ocute sorrow struck at once the hearts of tho riders. They had recognised the voico as that of Draper � they knew that the miserablo being who followed him and received his curses was bis wife. They rodo silently behind her, and halted noiselessly as slio came up with lier husband. He growled at her again as she approached. ' I am very tired, Samuel, ' they heard lier say in a low, uncomplaining voico ; ' and I fear I am not as strong as 1 thought I was.' She stood a moment as she spoke, as if relieved by tho moment's breathing space. ' Look here,' ho said in a hard voice, meant to convey tho brutal threat to her soul ; ' if you can't keep up, you can stay behind. I'll stay no moro for you ; so you can come or stay. Do you hear ?' ? 0, Samuel, you wouldn't leave me in this terrible place alone ! Have pity on me, and speak kindly to me, and I will keep up � indeed, I'l} not delay you any more to-night,' 

 ' Have pity on you ! ' he hissed be tween his teeth ; ' you brought me to this, and I'm to havo pity on you ! ' Ho turned and strode on in the dark. She had heard, but made no reply. Sho struggled forward, though her steps even now wero very unsteady. Mr, Wyville haying first attracted her attention by a slight sound, so that she should not be frightened, rode up to her, and spoke in a low voice. 4 1 am the Comptroller-General � do not speak. Give me your burden, You will find it when you arrive at the inn at Pinjarra.' She looked up and recognized Mr. Wyville ; and without a word she slipped from the straps of tho heavy load, and let him lift it from her.' 1 God bless you, sir ! ' she whispered tremulously ; ' I can walk easily now.' ' Here,' said Hamerton, handing her his wine-flask, 'keep this for yourself, and use it if you feel your strength fail ing.' ' Where is yoar husband going ? asked Mr, Wyville, ' He is going to the Vasse, sir. A whale-ship has come in there, and he thinks she will take us off.' 

 They rode on, and soon overtook Draper. Mr. Wyvillo addressed him in a stern voice. ' If your wife does not reach Pinjarra to-night in safety, I shall hald yon ac countable. I overheard your late speech to her.' The surprised caitiff made no reply, and the horsemen passed on. They arrived at the little town of Pinjarra two hours after. Next morning they found that Draper had arrived. Mr. Wyville arranged with the innkeeper and his wife for Harriet's good treatment, and also that a stock man's team, which was going, to Bun bury, should offer to take them so for on their way. It was a long and fatiguing ride for the horsemen that day, but as the night fell they saw before them' across an arm of the sea, the lights of a town. ' .That is Bunbury,' said Mr. Wyville, ' the scene of our friend Sheridan's san dalwood enterprise.' They stopped in Bnnbury two days, Mr. Wyville spending his time in the prison depot, instructing the chief warder in the new system. They found Ngarra jil there, with fresh horses. He was to ride with them next day towards the Vasse. (To be continued .) The sweetest, purest, most delicious and best Biscuits aro Arnott's Miik Arrowroots*
