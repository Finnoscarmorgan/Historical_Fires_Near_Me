 BOOK THIRD. Chapter VII. � Carteret to the Rescue� Phcehe HAS TO TELL. 

 Novelists are not unfrequently blamed for transgression of the unities, and the forcing � so to 6peak � possibilities in the working out of their plots, when in truth their narration may be quite in accord with every-day occurrences� links as they are in different chains of circumstance, forged by neces sity, welded by inexorable fate. Coincidences of a startling character are familiar to the experience of every one, and the remarkable fatality which brings people together at times 

 and places entirely beyond anticipation, and in defiance of ordinary probability, has often formed the theme of poetry and romance, and is a favourite subject for the ' situation '� of the dramatist. The opportune arrival of John Carteret at Auckland was owing to a matter of business in no way connected with the persons or events of this history It is therefore unnecessary to it further than to explain that he was confidentially accredited to the board of directors of the local bank, and had special instructions to the Governor and other high officials. That he should arrive on the very day on which Delville Darby returned from his more than mysterious expedition, and within a few hours of the arrest of Egremont and his consignment to gaol, was one of the extraordinary coincidences to which we have referred, which baffle all cal culation and prevision, and force even the most ardent believers in happy accident to consider whether, after all, there is not ' a providence which doth shape our ends, rough hew them aB we may. ' The talk of Auckland on that day was the Egremont affair, and marvellous indeed was the complexion it assumed, from the mere commonplace report of the proceedings in the police court to the last version, with any amount of circum stance, told at the street-corners. Carteret, even before 

 reaching his hotel, had heard several tra* 'i ? -- I accounts, and at the undoubted fact of the wn^5 ^dltr I arrest wasVleeply disturbed and grieved Hew i.1 ^ tie 1 thoroughly practical man, and as soon 'as li� v i �Wevtt a I toilette, drove off to the bank where he at ono **&* & I credentials, and had an interview with fLpresented his I director, who happened to be upon the m-enT manag-ag I with a letter requesting that the utmost attend ' ^efl I sideration might be paid to him, he thence nrZL^4 ��? to the office of the Commissioner of Police Th�6? direct I in, and exceedingly civil and obliging to a' �?�,� miot *M I such an introduction. gentleman ^4 I 'See the warrant for Mr. Egremont's arrest' r- I no objection whatever.

I Mr. Egremont down myself, and there need be no W?6 I delay.' lunaet I 'With many thanks Carteret took himself off andsn'f I came about that Egremont first met his old friend in tk I private room of the police magistrate, when the ouestftm t I bail was easily and satisfactorily settled. I It did not take long to make Carteret aufait to the who]* I business of the forgery from beginning to end. Pieci I together the bits of evidence he was able to gather ft� I Egremont, and considering these in conjunction wift I what he previously knew and had ascertained about DelviHs I Darby, he became entirely convinced. There was further I the rather extraordinary fact, all things being taken into I account, of that gentleman leaving England whilst actually I under bond to appear as a witness at the trial. By the time I the two friends, walking in close converse, had reached the I hotel, Carteret had determined his line of action, and at I once proceeded to put it in execution. Egreuiont, amongst I other confidences, had made no secret of his love for Mm I and the relations then existing between himself and her' I He told John also the whole story of his discovery of the I true character of Captain Hanson, and the difficulties con- I sequently existing in the way of marriage with the daughter I of such a man. ' He could not, would not, give up Myra ? I but what was he to do ? ' Ho confessed a dilemma but' I as men in the unreasoning state which 'love I produces are apt to do, he declined altogether I even the consideration of one alternative whilst assum- I ing to realise the impossibility of the other. Carteret I listened in patience ; he had often before, to his extreme I vexation, been made the confidant of enamoured youth. I There was something indeed about John which induced the I desponding ones to pour their woes into his bosom, and he I could almost have run the gamut of their protestations. I glorifications, and wailings of Byronic despair. Myra was, I �f course, according to Eustace, the perfection of beauty in I face and form and mind, and John, from experience, would I not at all have been surprised to see a very ordinary school- I girl, with a pretty; face perhaps, an insipid manner, and I about as much brains as a teetotum. He kept such surmises I to himself, however, and was content to say a word or two I upon the point raised as to the captain's (to say the least of I it) rather eccentric manner of carrying on business ; aud I here, again, he displayed his practical good sense. I ' In the first place, Eustace, you may possibly have I mistaken the full purport of the conversation you overheard. I Captain Hanson's character stands very high in monetary I and financial circles. Granted, however, that the worst is I true, there is no occasion to hurry a decision. ^Better tell I the captain plainly what you heard, and that you suspect I strongly that it had reference to illicit traffic in arms with. I the hostile natives. Hear what he has got to say. You I tell me he is a devoted father. To secure his daughter's I happiness he may be content to give up this evil business I once and for ever.' I ' At all events,' said Egremont, 'I must see him at I once. I have to explain my sudden departure and my present I position. This forgery � he may think me guilty� my I close his doors to me, without opportunity of coming to w. I explanation.' I 'Not,' interrupted Carteret, 'if he is the man I tote ? him for from your description. More likely to try and use ? you to his purposes. However, you had better lose no ? time ; go and see him at once. I will see to the telegrams ? for London ; they must go to-day.' I Egremont went down to the offices of Hanson and Co., ? and was an object of no slight interest as he passed ? through the clerks' room to Mooney's desk. The chief clerk ? was in truth delighted to see him, and led the way at once ? into the captain's private office, which was unoccupied. ? Grasping his hand warmly � I ' 1 was just coming up to Mount Eden to see you, n& ? said. ' I got your note, but could do nothing last night. ? The captain is away� at home, I fancy.

Egremont related what had occurred, and Mooney, on Jffl ? part was able to inform him that Delville Darby was again ? in Eden, his name having appeared in the list of passengers ? arriving from Sydney that same morning, posted, according ? to the usual practice in those days, at the Custom Hoase. ?

I t didEgremont require to be told this. He took the I Sul creature's hand and pressed it to his lips. I ..You have been her good angel, lo you she owes her I if. and I my love. But where is the handkerchief you I ilof taken from the dead mother ? ' I ff� Wait here a moment, I will run and fetch it, and I I vi|| tell Miss Myra you will be in presently.' I in a few minutes Phoebe returned with the handkerchief, I Jcfully folded in several wrappers of paper and oilcloth. I vnemont opened the packet with trembling fingers. I Hffcnrobably. he thought, may be the key to the mystery I �f Mvra'8 birth ! not tnat ne now evcn c01106^^ i4 Pos' I tihle to eive her up. But what if his birth should prove as I taourable as his own. What difficulties would be thus I moothed over, what future troubles averted, when she I dine to take her proper place as his wife ! The hand ? tcichief was of the finest cambric, still retaining the I faint aroma of some subtle perfume. Embroidered in silk I in one comer, the colours now faded from time, was a crest I 8nd monogram. Closely inspecting these. Egremont made I cut the monogram to be composed of the letter D, with the I letters C or G, or both, interlaced. The crest was unmis I takably the crest of the Delmains ! Could it be possible that I Myra cane of the same proud stock from which he him ? telf was sprung?� that she was a child of the Delniains, I related perhaps to Geoffrey, t--e present owner of the Towers ? I Egremont was quite bewildered at the thought. Again he I made Phcebe relate all the particulars of the illness and ? death of the poor lady, all means of whose indentification, I htfor the accidental preservation of the handkerchief, ? wuld have been lost with the ship. Two points, important I links in what Eustace hoped might prove the chain of I identification, Phoebe, from defective memory, was unable to I mpply. She could not recollect the name of the skip, nor ? the date, even to the year, of sailing from New York. The I captain, however, would probably be able to supply both, I and to him Eustace felt now the matter must be submitted. ? Upon this, however, he kept a discreet silence just now, I contenting himself with securing the handkerchief, making ? �few brief notes of Phoebe's statement. He would lay the I vhole matter, he thought, before Carteret, and be guided by I Mb advice as to the most judicious course of action to pursue. I k the meantime he would say nothing to Myra, and he ? �mtioned Phoebe to be equally reticent. I The rapturous meeting of the lovers may be imagined. ? We will not intrude upon its sanctity. Little was said ; I there seldom is on such occasions. What need of words, ? *hen eyes spoke eloquently, and quivering lips expressed | the sounds still inarticulate ? Buried within itself, audible ? but to the ear pressed close to where it breathes, is the music I of the ocean-shell re-echoing the melody of waters rippling ? on the beach. Even so the soft and dulcet tones of love ? Me not the common air, but vibrate only in the heart ? vine sympathy they wake. But Myra told of Darby's ? visit, his repuhe, and ignominious flight, and Egremont ? almost forgave the wrongs inflicted on himself ; the punish ? nentalready had been so terrible and bitter. To be driven ? from her sight for ever, never to see her more ! Hell surely ? tad no torments more refined in bitter anguish ! Oh bliss ? fid paradise of first and youthful love ! Why does the ? Mgel ever drive us forth? Happy indeed if the bright ? scenes are stamped a pleasant memory on our hearts� if the ? odour of the flowers linger when we are shut out from the I 'Wment of the r luxuriance and bloom.

The 

 constabulary keep up regular patrols to the very head of the valley, so that there is no fear of surprise. So far as I am concerned, I wish they would come ; they would get a warm reception.' ' That Te Kooti is an awful scoundrel, they say,' said Hanson, ' and has a lot of desperadoes with him who do not sticfe at trifles, but there is nothing to bring him here, I should Eay. No occasion for a Bcare on his account.' Just at this moment they were passing a neat little cottage standing back from the road, and having a well-kept garden in front absolutely teeming with fruit and vegetables. A tall soldierly-looking man, who was smoking his pipe at the gate, took the pipe out of his mouth at the approach of the horsemen, and, drawing himself up, saluted the major, who drew rein to speak to him. ' A fine evening, your honor. The patrol told me yon would be by, and I have been looking out for you. I noticed the fires again last night over the hills to the north. Scanlan, who was in the old war of '63, thinks there is mischief afloat.' ' Tut, tut, sergeant,' said the major. ' We have seen the fires a hundred times. We should certainly have heard from the native scout if there had been any movement of the hostile tribes in this direction. Depend upon it, they have got quite enough upon their hands further north, without dropping into a little hornet's nest like this.' 'Maybe your honor is right,' replied the sergeant, not feeling altogether satisfied, but seeing it was useless to discuss the question further. ' Good night,' cheerilv cried the major as he gave loose reinto{hiB horse. ' We shall have a big meeting to-morrow, and must see about calling in those old Enfields.' The sergeant gazed after the retreating horsemen, and then returned rather thoughtfully to the cottage, where the good wife had his tea waiting, and half a dozen white-haired urchins, from ten years old downwards, were perched on chairs round the table waiting for . ' father.' There was a general shout when he appeared, but before he sat down he went to the back door and looked out towards the hills. Again in trie far north he observed the lurid glare o f the watch-fires. It wa6 growing dark when the major and his guest drew near the homestead. They were welcomed by the loud bark ing of dogs, which brought out a curly-neaded urchin of son: 3 ten years, who held open the gate leading into the home paddock. ' Run in, Georgy,' said his father, ' and tell your mother we are here, and as hungry as hunters. We will ride the horses round to the stable.' Georgy ran in in high glee, and when, after getting rid of the horses and refreshing the outer man, the two gentlemen entered the house, Mrs. Gregg received them with a smiling face and the intimation that supper would be ready in a few minutes. The family circle consisted of a grown-up daughter, a pretty girl numbering some 17 summers, the boy Georgy, and four younger children, all of whom were waiting up to wish papa good night ; rosy little golden-haired cherubs who, happily unconconcious, were on the threshold of a brighter and happier world. At the time in the constabulary quarters a merry party was assembled. Captain Fenwick, who had charge of the block house, and was in command of the force, had invited his own officers, and the militia and volunteers resident in the neighbourhood, to meet a distinguished visitor from Auck land, a young gentleman on the Governor's staff who had arrived unexpectedly on a short visit. Mr. Delville Darby had indeed deemed it expedient to make himself scarce for a time, and had availed himself of an invitation of old standing from Fenwick. Possibly, had he known that Hanson was in the neighbourhood, he would have selected some other locality for temporary retirement ; but, travelling by an entirely different route, he was entirely ignorant of the cap tain's movements, and was, indeed, startled when he recog g-ised him as he rode out ot the township with Major Gregg. It would be easy, however, he thought, to keep out of his way ; he was down on business no doubt, and would soon be off again ; meantime Darby thought he would take a trip for the south for a few days in a steamer notified to sail the next morning. There was one matter, however, which troubled Delville not a little, nor did he well see his way out of the difficulty� the treasure obtained possession of at so much risk, and lying planted, securely enough certainly, in in the Dunstan cemetery. Hanson was not only in the secret, but without his co-operation it was difficult to con ceive how the gold could be safely got away. He did not see his way out of the dilemma. It was clear to his mind just now, with the memory of recent events so fresh, he could not meet the captain, and it was equally evidc nt that he could not rely on his own per sonal or unaided resources to effect the removal of the ' plant.' ' In fact, he could not with safety, and with out exciting suspicion, be seen at the Dunstan or in the neighbourhood. A large amount� a fortune, indeed �was at stake ; but, as things had turned out, the treasure might, so far as he was concerned, as well have remained in the iron boxes of the escort. In every respect just now he seemed caught in his own toils. Scornfully rejected by Myra, Egremont free, and aware, no doubt, of his true character, Carteret on the scene, with his conspicuous good sense and clear-headedness, � truly it appeared as if he had done the, devil's work, and after all, as not unfrequently happens was to be cheated out of the wages. That Darby was troubled with such thoughts, or indeed had any serious cares upon his mind, the party in Captain Fenwic'k's room could hardly have imagined. Relieved from the immediate pressure of anxiety, he was in high spirits, and altogether in good form, socially made himself especially agreeable, and was voted generally by all present an excellent, pleasant fellow. He had stories of London life to tell, more amusing, perhaps, than edifying, and the very latest scandal and on ditsoi the Eden upper ten, not sparing even the august person of his Excellency himself, of whose propensities other than domestic he had more than one high flavoured anecdote, and whose peculiarities of speech and gesture he mimicked to admiration. It was between one and two in the morning, and Delville had b?en induced to repeat one of his favourite songs� he had a fine tenor voice � when steps were heard hastily approaching, and a man, evidently by his dress one of the sentries mounting guard at the block-house, rushed into the room without ceremony, exclaiming, ' There are fires in the valleys ; the natives must be down close by the major's place. You can see the flames rising over the trees! ' ' Quiet, man,' said Fenwick, holding up his hand. ' It must be a bush fire : some of the settlers burning-off the scrub. Natives � nonsense ! ' ' Come out and see, 6ir,' said the man. ' The Lord help us, but it's no bush fire this time.' Seizing a field-glass, Fenwick, followed by his guests, rushed out, gaming the breast of the natural mount on which the stockade was built, and which commanded a view over the whole valley. 'Good God!' he said, after a moment's inspection. ' There are homesteads on flre. The black devils are at work, sure enough.' He ordered the alarm gun, kept ready loaded in case of emergencies, to be at once fired, gave some hurried orders, and was hastening to his room for his arms and accoutre ments, when a mounted man rode in at full speed ; one of his arms swung helpless by his side, and he nearly fell from his horse when, with difficulty, the animal was stopped by the constables and others fast mustering in force. He had a sad tale to tell. The patrol, of which he was one, when near the limit of then* beat at the head of the valley, and being on their return towards the township, discovered suddenly that the [road was occupied by a considerable body of natives, whose .intention were immediately evident, as, without challenge or warning, they poured a rolling volley into the approaching horsemen. The only chance was to gallop through, and trust to the strength and speed of the horses. This the troopers [attempted, but with only partial^ success. Two were either shot down or pulled off their horses. Simpson and the sergeant in command got through. Galloping for their lives, and in order to give the alarm along the valley, they sped along. At a turn of the road not far from the home stead of Major Gregg's they rode into, before they were hardly aware of it, a strong party of mounted natives, who, with revolvers ready drawn, evidently awaited their aproach. The sergeant was shot through the head.. Simpson by a miracle escaped with a broken arm and a bullet in the c houlder. By their dress, which was after the European fashion, he thought they must be Te KooM men.' 'Heaven help the poor people in the valley,' cried Fenwick : ' but there is not a moment to lose. I will take the mounted constabulary and volunteers At once. You, Jervis,' he said to a young officer near him, ' bring on the whole available force, leaving 50 men, in case of accident, to garrison the stockade. Let all the women and children in 

 the township be got in at once, and send amounted messenger to Captain Seymour at the Huranga redoubt, another to the port to warn the steamer and any vessel there to be on the alert in case of an attack in that direction.' The constabulary and troojjers were soon in the saddle, and in a few minutes were reinforced by some thirty well mounted men, armed to the teeth, making in all fifty strong. Delville Darby, who was no craven, and thought, moreover, that the front was perhaps the safest place under the circum stances, mounted a spare horse of Fenwick's, and when that officer dashed out of the stockade followed by his men, rode close beside him. Was there no warning voice to whisper in his ear? No foreboding that he went to meet his death? . At Willow Grange, as Major Gregg's place was called, it being specially noted for the magnificent growth of the willows, which throughout the demesne beautified^ both banks of the Waiparoa, their lower branches dipping in the crystal stream � the evening was spent in the quiet domestic fashion so characteristic of the middle-class Englishman's home. The two gentlemen smoked and chatted in the verandah until the air began to get chilly, then adjourned to the drawing-room, where they found Mrs. Gregg busy over her work, and Clara, the daughter, at the piano, running her lingers over the keys in a rambling manner, waiting for papa to ask for one or two of his favourite ballads. Georgy, very much against his will, had been sent off to bed. A refreshing cup of tea, two or three ' songs in Miss Clara's best style, and the ladies retired. Then the major and Hanson had a long confidential talk, with that thorough abandon which is only to be enjoyed under such circumstances� perfect quiet, the room not too brilliantly lighted, comfortable easy-chairs, a good cigar, and some first-rate cognac. The major fought his battles over again, and condemned the service, which ' had gone to the devil, by Jove ! ' Told of his early struggles in the colony, and how he was now well on the road to a snug competency, whilst happy as the day was long in this snug nest with his wife and children. Hanson too had his tales of flood and field, and made the major's flesh creep by recounting some of the desperate deeds of Desmond Fane, a name now almost forgotten, but once a terror in more than one latitude. It was late, indeed past 1 o'clock, when they retired to rent, bidding each other a cordial good night. Cnptain Hanson's room was on the ground floor, opening on the verandah as well as upon the broad passage which ran transversely through the hause, terminating at each end by the front and back doors respectively. He did not, somehow or other, feel much inclined to sleep, so he lighted a cigar, and sat musing at the window, which looked upon the shrubberies at the back of the house. There was no moon, but the stars were intensely bright, so that weird, fantastic shadows of the trees and shrubs were thrown upon the open spaces of lawn ; shadows ever and anon seeming to change their form as the light breeze gently shook the branches. What were the thoughts in this solemn stillness of the once Desmond Fane� the present 'honorable' and right worthy citizen and merchant of Eden? Did he think of hie betrayed and buried love crumbling to dust in that stately mausoleum beneath the Italian sky ? Did he see again those imploring eyes soon peering into the pride of unfor gi veness which gazed on his for the last time when his perfidy was clear? Did he think whether one who had the right to bear his name and call him .father survived a miserable birth and still lived an orphan indeed ? Did deeds of blood and lust rise up before his mind in ghastly identity P � deeds unatoned for, ipexpiated � deeds whose terrible record could never be wiped out. The secrets of the heart are not within the ken of man to fathom. Just what might be thought would be most all-absorbing passes with slight reflection and remorse in those whom it should bite as does a serpent, and seldom makes its fangs felt except under the accidents of discovery, exposure, and disgrace, or when the failing of the bodily powers renders the enjoyment of the things of this ?world no longer possible. Could we have read the thoughts of Desmond Fane in this almost his last hour of consciousness on earth, they would have been found centred upon the one pure object of his loves, his hopes, and fears� his little Myra� the waif which the ocean had cast into his lap, and which had repaid his tender and unselfish care with the only flashes of real happiness which had ever lighted up Mb soul. He may have been thinking of her, and over the many plans he had conceived for securing her future � her play ful affectionate waye, which made his home a paradox, and regenerated, so to speak, his life. Thus pleasant may have been his meditations, and. under the magic influence of the fragrant weed bright visions may have floated before his eyes of what might be in,the future, when he was suddenly disturbed by a loud trampling of horses which seemed to converge upon the front of the Grange. Anon a confused sound of voices and a violent knocking at the door. The idea of danger, or of an hostile attack, did not at first strike him, but the lateness of the hour, the suspicious rumours he had heard made so light of by hie host, rushed upon his mind with the force of conviction that all was not right. He opened his revolver case, without which he never travelled, examined and carefully loaded the weapons, and placing them on the dressing table, opened the door leading upon the passage. At the moment he did so Major Gregg, who had hurriedly come down stairs in his shirt and trousers, carrying a candlestick in one hand, opened the door, and confronting the persons who had made the dis turbance, some of whom were still on their horses, whilst others stood under the verandah holding theirs by the bridle demanded their business, .' making such a row at this time of night.' The answer was a volley of rifle balls, and the brave old man fell dead upon his threshold without a groan. Hanson, or Desmond Fane, as we may now call him, seeing at a glance how matters stood, taking a revolver in each hand, made a dash for the staircase on the other side of the passage, which led to the Bleeping rooms of the women and children. Here, against large odds of numbers, he made a brave stand, shooting down three of his assailants, and keeping the others at bay for at least ton minutes. Wounded in several places, and faint from loss of blood, Te Kooti himself (for hewas the leader of the gang) ran in at him and struck him clean over the head with a tomahawk. The blood 6purted over his face, and he fell heavily ; Te Kooti and his incarnate fiends leaping over him in their rush for the prey now within their grasp. What pen can describe the murderous cruelties, and worse than murderous, now perpetrated at will. Strong men who saw the scene next day weep now at the recollection. That poor mother ! Those helpless little ones ! Let us draw a veil over horrors which imagination must fail to realise, and which memory would fain blot out of her tablets. Georgy alone escaped. He slept over the stables, some little distance from the house ; the groom, who occupied the same room, at the noise of the firing seized his rifle and ran to the assistance of his master, being immediately shot, as was afterwards discovered. Georgy' finding he did not return, was about to follow him, when, looking out of the window, he saw the natives yelling and hooting round the house which they had set on fire. With a coolneES beyond his years, and thinking that his father had got away with the women and children, and would by and-by return for him, he made his way to the hay-loft and let himself down into the manger of the loose box just then unoccupied, covering himself up with the loose hay. A party of the natives came and took the horses, but seeing the loose box empty, did not even enter it, nor did they trouble to fire the stable in their anxiety to proceed further with their work of murder and rapine'. Georgy lay quite still until a couple of hours, after which he crawled towards the ruins of the house, hiding amongst the thick shrubs until the morning. Seven hometeads were in a blaze, lighting up the whole valley for miles, when Captain Fenwick came rushing down the road to the rescue. Te Kooti, warned by his scouts, instantly drew off his men, and retreated across the River Waiparoa towards the northern ranges. Several of the settlers, although taken entirely unawares, had bravely shown fight, and he had lost ten at least of his fiercest fol lowers, either killed or left wounded on the ground. He did not therefore care to meet an organised force, althaugh inferior in numbers, but who would strike, he knew, with all the intensity of vengeance. In the darkness it 'was im- i possible to trace his course, so he got off for the time scot-' j tree� and, shameful to say, is alive to this day, his crimes : having been condoned by the Government of the colony, for certain political reasons. The bloody outrages of Willow . Grange had been repeated at every violated homestead ; men, women, and children were found weltering in their gore, neither age nor sex having been spared. The gallant , sergeant who had endeavoured to warn Major Gregg the evening before was the last victim; he had had time apparently to barricade the windows and doora of hie cot 

 . ? ?- tage, and held the wretches at bay for some time, 'until they ' commenced piling brushwood against the walls, in order either to force the inmatPB out or roast them in it as in an oven. Then he sallied out from the back, taking them in the rear, and making considerable havoc with a carbine bayonet which he carried. He fell, pierced with several balls, just as the advance of the constabulary had been notified to Te Kooti, and his noble courage saved those who : were dearest to him. The troopers came up in time to save the cottage and release the widow and orphans ; whilst the corpse of the husband and father was brought in reverently and laid upon the humble bed. It was in the paddock surrounding this cottage that the only casualty occurred to the colonial forces. Three or four of the Maoris, desparately wounded by the sergeant, were ; lying on the ground. One of these, a sinister-looking ruffian, a great man, and a prophet amongst his people, gnashed his teeth with rage when he found himself left to die dishonoured and a prisoner. Before his action could be I noticed he had drawn a revolver from his belt and discharged it at Captain Fenwick, who was standing a few yards only from where he was lying apparently dead. Fenwick hap pened at that moment accidentally to turn half-round, and the ball, passing within an inch of his shoulder, struck Delville Darby full in the chest. He staggered and fell. Fenwick, greatly concerned, at once ordered a trooper to ride with all speed, to the township and send some convey- - ance, in order that the wounded man might be removed to the stockade and placed under surgical treatment. Amidst the blackened ruins of Willow Grange Captain Hanson was found, still breathing, although in an utterly desperate condition ; and so it happened that in the same room, which served the purpose of a hospital in the Turan ganui stockade, Desmond Fane and Delville Darby, sorely - stricken even unto death, were hud upon stretchers but a few yards distant from each other, to await the examination of the surgeons. The verdict in both cases was unfavourable. Nothing could be done in Darby's case, the ball haying perforated the lungs. 1 he various and complicated injuries of the other patient, at his advanced age, rendered recovery im possible. All that could be done was to administer pal liatives, and render the passage from life to death as easy physically as possible. Both the dying men were by this time sensible, and recognised each other. Fane, more than ever impressed with the likeness to some face familiar to him in the past, kept his eyes fixed upon Darby, who was restless under the scrutiny, and, unable to change his position, figeted with his hands about his clothing, which had been opened about his chest for the purposes of the surgeon. His fingers got entangled with a ribbon which . held something suspended around his neck, and in freeing them hurriedly the ribbon broke, and the small object to which it had been attached flew across the room and alighted on Fane's bed, and within reach of his unbandanged hand. It was a small silk bag, curiously embroidered in silver. Fane clutched it and held it up to his eyes ; he did not need to open it � he knew that it contained the pledge of mutual love � that it had been Carlotta's ; and all at once the con- . viction flashed across his mind that it was her likeness he ' saw renewed in Delville Darby. Few words were spoken ; upon that sad scene there should be no intrusion. Fane induced the kind attendants to place his bed side by side with that of his son ; he held his hand in his, never relin- - quishing it until his own was cold in death. What passed between them � whether then repentance was mutual and sincere � God only knows. Darby, who lived sonic hours after his father, sent for Fenwick, and in his presence inad9 a dying deposition completely exonerating Egremont in the matter of the forgery, and revealing the history of the escort robbery, 60 far as the locality of the treasure was concerned. He particularly entreated that his father's body might not be removed until his own was borne with it to the same grave. '* She was my sister, after all,' were his last words, and he died, as many sinners have before him, with a placid countenance and a smile upon hie lips. Epilogue. � Fob. ever Blest. Within two years from the day when Eustace Egremont bid farewell, as he then thought for ever, to his ancestral home, he returned to Delmain Towers the husband of the heiress of those wide domains. The clue of the handkerchief, slight as it might have appeared, had led to the establishment of Myra's position as the daughter of Geoffrey Delmain, and the fair girl had been gladly welcomed to the old man's heart. Ever of a rambling and rather eccentric disposition, he had married the beautiful daughter of an Australian sheep-farmer, and had carried his bride off for a roving tour about the world previously to settling quietly in England, as he then in tended. On his way through the United States the love of adventure tempted him to accompany a friend, distinguished in the military service of the great republic, in an expedition against the Indians, then becoming very troublesome to the , frontier settlers. He sent his wife on to New York, and there, a few weeks afterwards, authentic information of hor husband's death reached the poor young creature. He had fallen in an ambuscade, and his body, with those of the others killed, had been carried off. Completely broken down in health and spirits, Mrs. Delmain determined to return to her own friends in Victoria, and engaged her passage in the ill-fated Peytona. Geoffrey Delmain, however, was not dead. Badly wounded, his life had been spared, and eventually he escaped from the Indian territory and found hi6 way to New York, only to hear of the loss , of the Peytona and the unaccountable disappearance of his wife and child during the catastrophe. Recovering after a . long illness,' and convalescent from the brain fever which supervened upon the utter prostration of mind and body into which he was cast by the intelligence, he left no stone unturned to find some trace of the missing ones, who he never could bring himself to believe were dead. He became a ' very ' wandering Jew' in his continued travels by sea and' land, visiting all the seaports on the Atlantic coasts and West Indian Archipelago, but without success ? Desmond Fane having, for his own purposes, kept his part of the story a profound secret. Abandoning at last the vain search, more eccentric than ever, Geoffrey gave himself up to philosophical and scientific studies ; and it was in pur suit of one of his ethical chimeras that he had, upon a certain definite system, developed the handsome lithogra phic apprentice into that transient star amongst tihejeunesse doree of the metropolis who was known as Delville Darby. This, he was constrained to own, was not a success, and . his theory as to the fallacy of the generally accepted propo sition that ' what is bred in the bone will come out in the. flesh ' he was obliged to own as untenable. It was by John Carteret' s advice that the deposition, of' Phoebe as to the circumstances attending the rescue of herself and the infant from the burning ship by the boat of - the Phantom^andthe handkerchief itself, were sent without delay to Mr. Dehnain, who, with the knowledge already in his possession, required no further proof of identity. That, his newly found daughter should be betrothed to Egremont made the cup of his happiness full. It was exactly -what? he could have wished � united again in indissoluble bonds the ancient stock, and redeemed the justifiable wrong he always felt that he had done in making good his claim to, - the estates. So, as the old stories have it, ' they all lived happily ever afterwards.' In New Zealand the true characters of Captain Hanson and Delville Darby were never known. The captain by his will left everything to Myra, but Egremont declined to touch the things, and by his direction it was, without notice or publicity, distributed amongst the various charitable in- - stitutions of the colony ; if not lawfully acquired, serving a good purpose at last. The secret of the escort robbery was well kept, and it is a mystery to this day, even to the police, how the information was obtained which let to the discovery of the treasure. A handsome monument to Del ville Darby was erected in the Auckland cemetery, recording his many virtues and his gallant death, fighting 'in defence of our hearths and homes.9 ' Sir Barnaby Blather, however, coughs and gets very red in the face when his late favourite secretary is referred to, and it may be believed is acquainted with most of the facte recorded in this veracious history. THE END. 

 A singular circumstance has been narrated to the Marg horough Standard. Mr. D. Bilton, the well-known farmer at Craigie, was leading a mare with foal at foot along a highway, when, in passing a mob of horses, the latter attacked the foal. In spite of the efforts of Mr. Bilton, the horses worried the foal until they killed it, as it was as much as Mr. Bilton could do to save himself and the mare he was leading from injury, the infuriated animals turning upon them also. No reason can be assigned for the strange freak on the part of the horses.
