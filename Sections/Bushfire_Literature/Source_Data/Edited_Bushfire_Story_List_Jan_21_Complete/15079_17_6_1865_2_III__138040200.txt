 , In earning out the incident* of a crime, we often find that the moat consummate 

 conning and address are employed, Meti who have never displayed the slightest fore' eight in the ordinaiy business of life, who have never been able to overcome common 

 difficulties, will yet, in the prosecution of j 

 crime, show many of the best qualities man can possess. Determination, perseverance and forethought, seem to be inherent in their minds; and sound judgment, well-weighed schemes, and complete success, seem to show 

 that they have capacities of a high ordcij. j But when thr work is accomplished�th* orimf : committed�these qualities leavs (hem ^o- ] gethcr. 3ho teacUggs of evil paint out easy and sate methods of attaining the ends in view. They accept the offered guidance. 

 Ihey slavishly obey. They follow the evil i promptings until the nefarious transaction is 

 accomplished, or the bloody deed is done; then ? lliey are left in a mate�a tangled web�they arc nl their wits' end, and they have no power to extricate themselves. Their crimes find tbem out,�and -the etnmg wnn of the Uir 

 punishes them as they righteously deserve. ; j

 Fanny and Jack congratulated themselves 

 meanwhile ?' on the snooess of their scheme. | Balckc was in their power. (The neighbouring , squatters believed him to bo dead. A para 

 graph appeared in the Melbourne newspaper j headed, " fire in the bush. Finding of the re mains of a hone; and probable death of j. 

 Balckc, Esq., who was last seen riding, the j animal." There was a notice in another j column:�" Died�On the 3rd inst, J. W. j BalckeEsq., of Quagumckjop, having perished in a bush-fire, liis sorrowing widow mourns lliE loss." 

 Fanny arrayed herself in widow's woods, ' and assumed all the outward signs of grief. 

 In a short time notice was given that letters I 

 of administration would be applied for, and in | the meantime the sheep and cattle were sold ] as rapidly as possible. Fioek after flock, and herd after herd were disposed of, and in a 

 very brief period some thousands of pounds j 

 were collected. 

 Slow that the conspiracy had turned out so | 

 wefl, and as the risk of discovery was con. 

 tinually before their eyes, they made up their J 

 mind to decamp with the booty. 

 It has been well said by the sacred pen 

 man, "The wicked flee when no man j pursueth." This is the case, for when a crime ! has been committed the guilty persons 'are J 

 constantly afraid of being brought to justice^ They are frightened at shadows, and alarmed at the squeak of a'mouse. Their -aacusing consciences irresistibly goad them on putting "deep from their eyes, and dumber from their eyelids," and peace and quiet for from than. Anxiety preys on the mental/And fever, as a consequent, on the physical sBlia tore. The joys of life are sapped, aodthr foundation of all happiness is destroyed. .7 , 

 About a month after Balckc had disappeared 

 Fanny went to Portland, and took paessgolor Melbourne in a small coaster. It was given out that her presence was peoeasMy at. Use metropolis, In order to expedite some dagel matters touching the letters of administration. Jade followed her in a fow days. He told the people in the neighbourhood that he lwaa going to the north,to complete the pnrchaqc of a small station ; and that, as Mrs. Balcbc intended to sdl her mm, be wonld oommenqc stockholding oo his own account. Instead 

 1 going north, however,. he steered his' Wr^r" across country, in the direction of Melbourne, j where he arrived the day after Fanny gotinto 1 Hobaon's Bay. .
