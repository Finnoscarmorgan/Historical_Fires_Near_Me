 CHAPTER I.- < ' THBOTJQH THE EIBB. ? ' 

 " YeB," he said, " they look out of place there, don't thej? A lifebuoy and a set of 

 horse's hoofs s�ve mounted are not onl about the last oombini tion you would thin it likely to find hang ing in a hall, but seer stranger still among ol snits of armor an� Bwords, and spears an� antique guns. Yet . would sooner part wit! the whole oolieotion o onrioBities than witl the lifebuoy and th� horse's hoofs." 

 They oertainly die look out of place The time waa Christ -mes Eve, the place a v large square hall in an 

 old English mansion, lt had a great fireplace in it, with a chimney like a oavern; and doora opened in ita oak Sanelling in every 

 ireotion but the one expeoted. It was hung around, aa has been said, with old weapons and anita of armor and other relioB of the dayB when war and battle were the greatest and most glorious things on earth. But over the fireplaoe were four horse's hoofs set in Bil ver; and these were BO arranged aa to form a kind of oentre-pieoe inside the ring formed by a lifebuoy. 

 The host and owner of the place had just shaken hands with me at the door, and waa welcoming hia eon'a college chum in the hall, which was well lighted np, and had a great fire of Christmas Fogs roaring up ita wide ohimney. I had come to spend Christ mas with Tom Cots wold'a people, and there waa hia father r-a fine, stalwart aotive ' man, who did not look 

 his 55 years of age. , And later on that evening Mr. Cotswold, without muoh entreaty 

 from hia son and daughter, and with a fond look first at hia handsome wife, who seemed ridiculously young for Tom'a mother, told us (hia half-dozen visitors) the atory why a life buoy and a Bet of horse's hoofs ocoupied the place of honor amid helmets which had been dented by Bore battle atrokeB of old, and � swords and spears 

 whioh had made widows and orphans in many a fight. He said 

 " Those horse's hoofs oame from Australia. Thirty years ago, though her goldfields had made her name known throughout the world, and though people of all kinda and degrees orowded there in search of fortune, Britain was 

 not as intimate with her nor she with Britain aB they are to-day, when the passage to and fro is but a plea sure trip, and the Association Cricket Ground at Sydney is aa well known to our oraok orioketera as Lord's or the Oval is to those of Australia, and when it only wanta an Australian horse to come over and show them his heels in. the Derby for Australia to be first in the field in all that Britain has claimed for herself before. First on tho orioket ground, first on the soul ling course, and first on the green turf. Ah, woll, I sup pose you young fellows are laughing at me for 1 blowing * ; but, 

 remember, I am an ' Australian born and 

 bred; and so ia Mrs. Cotswold; and we're proud of it, and of thoBe four Australian' hoof a on whioh stood the stoutest, truest horse whiohever looked through a bridle, and brought me and my young wife (she waa my sweetheart then) through the hot flamea of a florae bu�h fire, whioh, as tho Bible aayB, ' has compassed us about on every 

 side.' 

 " It was Christmas time, as it ia now ; and she and I and half a dozen more lads and lasaos were riding to a Christmas party whioh Bomof rienda were giving. Those were the days when the old families of Ans 

 tralia (they call it New South Wales now) lived on i their land in houses, which nowadays are called old- j fashioned, but are modern compared with that whose roof shelters us to-night ; and in those days hospita lity at a homestead meant something. The garden was loaded with fruit ; the oellar was full of good 

 wine. 

 " Well, well, if I moralise like this I'll never tell my story. Your mother, Tom, and I were the only oonple in the party who were not heartwhole ; and BO we lingered behind the rest; letting our horses walk until the others were far ahead of us. We had 

 to orosa a deep prorate, on the Bides of whioh the sorub grew thiokly. The narrow road wound. down one side, and, after crossing a olear stream, wound up the other. There waa open country abovo on either Bide. The air was hot with the Bmoko of bush fires ; and away down the gorge one waa barning. But, aa onr horses went at a foot paco down the road, I was telling your mother tbe old old story whioh Adam told to Eve, and whioh Tom and you young fellows will Bomotimoa he telling, if, indeed, a few of you bavo not told it already. When wo carno to the. stream, and let our horaos bond down their curving 

 neoks to drink, my lass had promised to be mine for weal and woe ; and it was only then we notioed that the buHh fire had orept np the aide of the gorge we bad passed, and had orossed the top of the road we had come down by, wrapping it in flame and smoke. And there, on the other side, up whioh wound the road we had to olimb, the fire was coming swiftly up on the summit like a fringe against the Bky. It waa foolish of ns, who Bhould have known better, to have let onrselvea get oanght in Buoh a trap. A glance round as we descended, the smallest thought, a little quioker paoe with our 

 horses, and we should have boon all right. But, as Adam Bald io Eve, 

 "With thee conversing I forgot all timo. 

 "And sure I am I thought of neither time nor plaoo, nor sky above, nor earth beneath, nor any thing around me that day, when I was telling my love to my love." 

 I declare that while Mr. Cotswold was speaking Uko this his face lit up with a radianoe whioh made �B all forgot how unfashionable it is. nowaday s to bo anything but prosaic ; and not oven �, though a moat 

 irreverent youngster on oooasiona, oonld feel any* thing hut the deepest sympathy with him as he told his story. As for Mrs. Cotswold, she only said 

 " You cannot wonder that I waa forgetful to all around me as was your father. Hear how well he talks now ; and judge how well he talked then, and made me think of nothing but him." 

 ^ The story-teller went on : "I believe it ia not oon* Bidered good form in these'modern timeB to make love in Bweet poetic fashion ; and certainly it would in one Benae have been better for us tbirty yeara ago if we had been mote matter of fact. I do not know, 

 thou.h ; for then moat likely my wife and I

 together through a danger which knit our hearts together for ever 

 after. 

 " There waa no time to he lost. We daBhed through the river, and up the road as hard aa our horses oould travel so steep a war. We could hear the fire orashing and oraoklinsr through the sorub, and roaring aa it twisted up the tree trunks, and caught the branohes above. But as yet the road was open; and, though smoke was filling it lue a fog, it gave safe passage. But juet as we got within a hundred yards or so of the top when we should be olear of the sorub, and where the Bhort grass on the open land would let ns pass through the fire in safety, my darl ing's horse stumbled and fell. She herself dropped olear and un hurt, and did not faint, as I believe it is customary to do in these oaBBB. Her horse Eave a stretch of his 

 ead, or rather a queer shiver of it, and was dead. His neok was broken. And there beyond me was the fi/e coming to orosB the road, liok up the sorub on the other side with its hot month, and make the road itself a furnace. Yon see, there was no way out of it for us but along the road. The dense Bomb and undergrowth pre vented eBoape by any but one way. 1 took off my coat, wrapped it around by darling's head and shoulders, took her in front of me on the Baddie, and started Starboard, my good horse, up the sloping road whioh led to death pr safety. He oarried us through unharmed, though the last fifty yards felt like a furnaoe for heat ; and the smoke nearly suffocated me. Bat it could not have been long after we were out ot the sorub and in the open where the fire was not to be feared, that the road we had come was a sheet of flame. 

 . "Now, you can guess why Starbeam never wanted the kindest care I and my wife oould give him while he lived, why when I had to take to an English home and an English lite with my wife, Starbeam was brought to England too, and why when he died from Bheer old age ' in clover' the four hoofs whioh had borne us eo well from death were mounted, and placed where you Bee them." 

 JuBt here Mr. Cots* wold looked at me, and went on-" But why with a lifebuoy around them? I can see you say by your looks. Ah, that explains why Star beam and I had to leave Australia and come to England ; and of course my story wonld not be finished without that."
