Kate to takb a walk in the-'fields with him, \'ab and' when! they were together he told her the rea3ori; of/VValter's absence, and erideavbred ;to convince her of the latter's personal safety, He assured her that though the loss he would suffer might be considerable, yet that he had property of other kinds, and; .would in a few years, probably, be able to replace ill that hs had lost. He ex plained that Walter was a calm arid pru dent man, and - not likely, particularly under existing circumstances; to risk his life unnecessarily. While he spoke on those topics they had gradually strayed some distance from home, and were alarmed at the sight of several horsemen gallopping towards them. The leader, whose giant formandenor- ', raoua whiskers proclaimed him to be the 1 celebrated Black Tom, spoke somchurried words to the rest, some of whom dis- j mounted and seized the shrieking Kate,\
whilst others held old Stafford, Kate was .placed on -.the saddle in front of Blaok Tom, who immediately gallopped off in the direction of BurraYatta, and the rest of the horsemen followed, leaving the' quaker on tlie ground. As soon as the old man was freed he made his way to a small farm house, which was near the road, and asked for a horse and assistance, The former was immediately brought; but the latter could not be procured with out delay. He therefore preferred to go on alone. His horse was a practiied 'stbbk horse, and the Quaker light of "weight. He thus gained fast upon the bu.shrarigers," and at last arrived within pistol shotuof'. them. The clattering. of-::his"!h6rSe'SIh"66'fs' attracted the . attention, ..of the! party,. and oneEf thertridrew- a pistol :frOYn: his belt, but Black Tom sternly forbade, hirri . to fire.
