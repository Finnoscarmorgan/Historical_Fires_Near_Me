CHAPTER IV. 

 The next three days wore passed pleasantly and quickly at tho Marsden Homestead. Rides, dnvos, boating, lawn tennis, billiards, and music were indulged in. There were callers from Marie's home, and Amy Marsden came over " to have a look at Philip," as she said, and was charmed with his English friend, and rang his praisos, till Alan Malcolm threatened to exterminate him if ho heard another word. They were all to have gone to the Beaumonts on the 24th, and spend Christmas Eve thero, and hold a council over tho next day's programme. But, as the horses wero being run in from the paddock, Philip carno dashing in to say that tho boundary fence (a brush one) was on fire, and burning furiously. Calling all available help, he jumped into the buggy, followed by Richmond, and they dashed off to the sceno of the fire, five miles from tho houBO. Philip oxplained as they tore along that it waa tho boundary fenco betwoon his own and Beaumont's stations, and ho had beon trying for months to got that gontloman to go halves in having a good wiro fenco put tboro instead of tho brush, which almost invited a firo to visit it. 

 " Danger?" ho said, in reply to a question from Richmond. " No actual danger to lifo. But it robs our sheep and cattlo of hundreds of acres of good grass. But here we aro, and tho mon work- ing like bricks." 

 Leaving' tho horses with tho blade hoy who had como with thom, Marsdon and his frionda woro soon hard at work pulling out tho brush which was as yet untouched, in order to malro a gap and atop farther progress of tho fire. A yellow drag with four steaming borsou dashed up Boon afterward, and eight mon scrambled out. Ono of thom, a short, stout, genial-faced, gentlemanly man, was Mr. Beaumont, and, busy as ho was, Philip could not resist calling out, " Halloa, Mr. Beaumont! What about my new-fangled notion the wiro fonce, oh !"' 

 Waving his hand only in reply, Mr. Beaumont '. toro oil' his coat and bogan beating out tho patches J of burning grass, which tho falling cinders and J sparks were constantly igniting. Suddenly tho 1 wind, p. brisk north ono, died out ; in tho calm t which succeeded they got the lire well under con- ( fcrol, and wore congratulating themselves on their i easy victory, when, with a sudden puff, tho wind i shangod, and a brisk puff eont tho Aro ahead 

 among tho long dry graso in a paddock reserved l>y Philip for his markot sheep. Away it wont, and nothing moro could bo dono bat let it lick up all before it. Philip, Richmond, and three mea drove round it to a ploughed lino, which Philip said would stop farther progress that way; but it would got into a brushy, scrubby bit of country which would blaze for many hours. All tho afternoon till sundown they worued at beating rho grass beyond ploughed ground ; Richmond earning many complimentary speeches from the owner and men of tho station for tho way in whichello worked. Mrs. Marsden sent a man up with a light cart and a supply of refreshments, and canteens of tea, which were soon drained by I the workers. Not until dark could they desist 

 from their labor ; and, tired beyond description, they drovo homo, leaving two men to watch part of tho night, whon two more would relievo them the other part. When thoy reached the home- stead, they were smoked and blackened almo�t beyond recognition, and wore glad to go straight to the bathroom, and got back some resemblance to white men. Of course the journey to Pinin gereo Station had to be postponed for that night at h ast, as it was unsafe to leave the fire until it

 Tho two tired men wore glad to do tho ladies* bidding after dinner, viz., "each take a hammock and lie thore," watching the magnificent pano- rama spread beforo them. The night was in- tensely dark and still ; and tho lake lay calm as glass below thom. The fire had burned into a bend of tho lake whore there were much under- growth and fallen timber. It had caught the trunks of tho docayod trees, and went blazing up each one until the top would come crashing down, throwing up millions of sparks. Every detail was mirrored in the calm water, till, as Richmond said, " they seemed surrounded by the fiery ele- 

 ment." It was a sceno to be remembered-some- thing grand and sublime. Philip expressed his intention of camping for the night in his present quarters ; so that he could keep an eye on the fire, as it is were ; and Richmond declared his inten- tion of keeping him company. So the ladies retired

 whatever guise old Father Christmas came-with bush fire, spreading devastation as it travelled, or with the joy and feasting among friends, which was more befiting the old fellow's coming. 

 At early dawn our two friends were on horse- back and oft' to the scene of the fire, which had burned itself out, and was like a sullen, angry thing, still fuming and raging, though spent and conquered. After seeing how things were, Philip gave instructions to the men to stay there for a few hours longer, and he would arrange on his return to tho station to send out five or six aboriginals, with materials for a " Kissmass tuck out" as they term it; and they would camp there and watch the fire. The mon thanked him. for his consideration j and as he mounted and turned homeward they gave three hearty cheers " for the Boss," and with the prospect of a jolly af ter noon and night with their fellow workers on the station, unlimited "plum dull," wild turkey, and rum and milk, they went whistling and singing 

 rm f.hoir natrol. 

 Philip rode home via the blacks ' camp ; and Rich- mond was highly amused at the greetings, a3 Philip cracked IUB whip over the top of their " wurley.'' A blear-eyed, withered old crone appeared with a blanket draping hor lean figure, and said, " That's Misser Philip, my son. You know me long timo, my word. Which one that follow ?" she asked, pointing to Mr. Richmond wita a hand covered with scraps of flour and pasto, as thoy had inter- rupted her preparation for breakfast in the making of a damper. Marsden told the sable dame who it was; and she straightway produced a broken clay pipe from a rag round her head, and asked him for "bit of baccy." Philip told her she was an inveterate cadger, and asked for her son, Tom Butcher, who responded to Borne gut* tural call of hors by appearing at the opening. On Philip proposing that theyiBhould take "plenty tuck-out, including a big puddiug," and go to Coorong Ponge and watch the fire, there was a general grunt of approval, and five or six moro bogan preparations for departure. After seeing the men's cook and tho storekeeper, and arranging for a horse and dray to carry thom out, Philip turned to Richmond, and, holding out his hand, said, " Begone, dull care. A morry, jolly Christ- mas, old follow ; may we Bpend many together." 

 Richmond shook hands, and said, " Thank you. I trust that this will bo tho first of many Christ- mas greetings wo may be able to exchange." 

 Reaching the house, they found a large party assembled-tho whole of Mr. Malcolm's family, ten in all, including Mr. and Mrs. Malcolm. Four sons, Alan (21) and threo others, li), 12, and 2 years old respectively ; four daughters, Mario, whom wo already know, and throe under her acte. nice, frank, ladylike "iris, little and bitr. 

 Mrs. Malcolm was a fine, handsome matron, whoso genial smile won all hearts. As tho day was young, and thoy did not wish to reach thoir host's house bet�re evening, they planned out a day's amusement, and succeeded in hilling time vory pleasantly till tho afternoon, when, in traps and on horsoback, tho whole party started in gay spirits. After a merry spin over good travelling ground, they reached thoir desti- nation, and rccoived a hearty Christmas welcome from the numbor of pooplo assembled to meet thorn. There were about twenty-four people in all; and being strange, Richmond had timo to look around him, and was much impressed with tho genorous, free hospitality which was lavished upon tho guests, and tho refinement and English air of luxury which ho had met with at the houses of tho squatters-English in some things, yet, through it all, something so un-English. There was less formality, for ono thing. Tho gathering reminded him moro of similar ones in Canada. Biro. Beaumont, tall, elegant, and fair, iookod not moro than UH, though ten years older, and the mother of four boys, tho eldest a lad of 17. Ho board her saying to Mrs. Marsden, " Yeo; I am so norry she couldn't come in to dinner. . But tho drive in tho heat has made her giddy ; mid as she io our principal one in the tableau to-night, I am 

 anxious for her to rest."
