The Misfortunes of Beilby Boolger. 

 CHAPTER XI. 

 BY [?] 

 THE shearing being over, the wool packed, and the drays loaded therewith, Leysid determined to convoy them to port, taking Scoles with him, and leaving Boolger in charge. 

 Before starting, Scolcs essayed to redeem bis part of the bargain witli Teddy. A broken bullock bow was fashioned into a hook, with a couple of yards of chnin attached, to which was bont the wool-press rope. The next thing was to find out Tom's whereabouts. He had not been scon since the bucket feat. The men vowed that Teddy's Kerry howl had frightened him. Ho was at last discovered in a small holo about a mile f rom the camp. The second pro ceeding was to find a bait which would tempt his majesty's appetite. Boolger proposed ruu ning down a kangaroo for the purpose. " No," said Ned, "it would take too long. I know of something better than that. Paddy Cran'a slut has pups about six weeks' old. I will persuade Teddy to steal one. Tom will get the credit of having taken it." Teddy stole the pup, and all hands not other wise employed mustered to assist in Tom's death�capture was not to be thought of. "It seems so cruel,"said Will, "tosacrifice the poor puppy." "If thy heart fail thee," said Ned, "stay at home. lam mightily moved in this matter; I hate washing, ergo, Tom is bound to die. Load yourpieccs, boys, in case the rope should break" �a suggestion which sent an uncomfortablo creeping sensation through the hearers. When they arrived at the waterholc the puppy was tied to the hook, and a piece of light wood attached, the weight being too great for the puppy to float with. The bait was then flung into the hole, a turn taken round a tree, and everyone got out of sight of the water, preser ving complete silence. The wretched little dog floundered about, howling piteonsly, and struggling hard to reach the bank. One soft-hearted chap was heard to mutter, "Oh! d n, this is too bad!" Yet that same fellow would have had no com punction about firing into a mob of blacks, who had not injured or annoyed him, just to show he was a " white" man. The sound suddenly ceased, Scoles glanced at the bait, and seeing the float disappearing slowly, not? leaving a ripple on the water, he motioned to those who had hold of the rope to pull in the slack, which grew tight gradually until it was like a harp string. Then, with a rush which made the rope crack, Tom came to the surface, bellowing, snapping his jaws, and lashing the water into foam with his tail. Six men neld the rope � pulling on it was out of the question. Scoles raised the rifle, but for some time could not Set an aim. The men were crying out that [icy could not hold much longer. At length Tom seemed to steady, and Scolcs tired. No one could tell whether the ball had taken effect or not for some minutes, such a commotion ensued. Then the rope slackened, and tho saurian lay on the surface, presonting the ap pearance of an old log encrusted with bar nacles. " Haul in the rope," shouted Ned. "No thundering fear I he might not bo dead yet." " On, he is dead enough. If you do not pull him alongside the bank now no will sink in the deep water, and a team would not pull him out." " Oh, bother !" said one of the drivers, "ho cannot be so heavy as all that." They found it just as much as their united strength could effect to pull tho carcass whero they could get at it. " What's the good of him now we have him V said the former speaker. " Quien sabe," said Scolcs, shrugging his shoulders. "He is dead ;my washing bill is settled for some months. I mean to have sonic steaks off him for Teddy." The skin off the underneath was stripped for belts, pouches, and thongs. There was nothing in his inside save the mangled remains of tho puppy, a quantity of grass, and six or seven stones of a few pounds weight. He was minus one fore claw, and his skin was scarred. If ho had bVen a king among his kind, hia sovereignty seemed to have been aisjuitctl. Teddy was rejoiced to hear of his enemy's death. No persuasion could induce him to even touch the steaks until reminded that, having eaten shark, he was already denied. "Faith, there's Bomethin' in that," said Teddy. He commenced to cook them at once. The meat was so tough, and had such a strong musky flavour, that it was not much in demand. "If a fellow was starving, I dare say ho might manage it," said Ned. " Even then it would be, as the marine said when he stole his officer's can do Cologne, ' Puir stuff, puir stutF. It's just better tnannacthing tiva.'" After the departure of the teams, life at the camp was pretty dull, only that now and thru it was enlivened by the advent of persons looking for country or returning fur their stork. Tlir news brought by these chance visitors was eagerly devoured. A book or two, or some aged newspapers, were procured in exchange for others which had been read ami ro-read until the content* were known by heart. Sonic of those returning for their stock gave glowing accounts of the'outside country ; others, again, the very opposite relation. " Vt'c shall have to stick to Nod's motto," said Boolger�" (!o and see for ourselves." Tales of encounters with the natives were l>y no means scarce, but Tom Burns was of opinion that there was something apocryphal about these yams. One evening two men came to the camp. They were returning, in search of employment with some other party, and in the course of their talk Will heard them mention Mr. Allon's name. " Have yon scon that party?" he a^Ketl. " (>h, yes; we stopped with them for :i time. They were in difficulties. Between flooded creeks and rivers, and hostile blacks, they hud a lively time of it." " The natives arc troublesome, then ':" said Will, 

 "Yos, in sorao places; but this party's troubles were all brought on by a combo they have in their party." " Combah, do you mean ?" asked Boolgor. 44 Well, I believe that is hia name," said one: '4 but he ia tho other thing, too." 411 do not quite understand you," said Boolger. Tom Burns laughed. "Do you not know what a combo ia ?" " No ; I thought it a play on his name," said Will. 44 A combo is a chap who runs after black women." "Oh, I see now." 44 More than half tho rows with the niggers aro caused by that very thing," said one of the travellers. 44 You sco, Mr. Allen left his party encamped on a creek and went on an exploring trip with two men, leaving this fellow Combah in charge. The blacks were pretty thick round them, but quietly disposed. A few of them had come to Allen's camp, were fed, and went away, making signs which the whites supposed meant that they would return with others. The day after their departure this fellow Corabah takes one of the chaps with him and runs the tracks to the blacks' camp. When they reached it tho men were all away; only some women romainod. and they were frightened to death at tho sight of the white devils and their horses. Combah seized one and forced her on his horse, tolling the other fellow to do likewise. They brought the women to Allen's camp and kept thorn there. Tho other men did not approve of this, and were for sending the poor devils away, but Combah insisted on keeping them. There was a mutiny, and they came very near fighting among themselves; but they had a visit from tho tribe, who appeared in full fighting trim. Neither party could understand the other, but the whites knew very well that the niggers had come for their women. The cattle were scat tered, as the men would not leave the camp in the face of three or four hundred enemies�not even to bring the horses up. Luckily the blacks �were frightened of them and the cattle, or there would have been a rare bit of sport. Allen came back and found things in this mess. He very quickly sent the women to their people, and the tribe retired for the time, but tncy gave Allen's people no end of trouble before they got their cattle together again. Having found that the stock ran from them, they, out of pure devilment, used to run them. This little game had to be stopped, and so they came to blows. The party we were with were some 200 miles beyond Allen's. As my mate and I returned we found them as I tell you, and remained to see them out of their trouble, which was only when they reached another tribe's ground." 44 But what of Combah ?" inquired Will. 44 Well, Allen would have sent him about his business there and then, only that he knew to do it would be sending him to his death. The blacks would have had him before he had gone ten miles. He wanted to send him in with us, but we said 4No, thank you; he does not travel with us a mile; we know each other.'" 441 would much like to see this fellow for a few moments," said Will. 44 Well, you will see a superfine rascal when you do. We heard his character from the men. Take my advice�have nothing to do with him; you will only soil your hands. He'll turn up, never fear; coons like him don't care about roughing it outside." 411 have a little account to settle with him; that's all," remarked Boolger. As time wore on without any letters being received from him, Boolger began to wish for Loysid's return, that he might be free�what to do he did not know; only to leave the place. Life was stagnation. One thing he was thankful for�that his sable brethren kept aloof. Any conflict with them in Lcysids absence he would have looked on as a misfortune. But for the fun afforded them by Teddy, time would have hung heavy on their hands. Teddy was one of the Handy-Andy tribe. If a possibility existed of anything being wrongly done, he was Bure to take that way of doing it. It was a thing of rare occurrence at that time to see candles burning in a camp of travelling stock; but Will had found a tin candle-mould among the stores, and, under his instructions, Mr. Malan had made some mutton tallow (fat being plenti ful and of no other value), superseding the common dirty and disagreeable fat-lamp in use previously in what was known among the men aa "the cove's" tent. Arthurs had come in from hia supervision of the shepherds and stock after dark one evening, and Boolger and he were sitting before a fire-stove�fashioned from an old nail-can, by punching some holes in the lower part and cutting a square piece out in the front�in conversation, when Teddy entered to light the candles. He had lit one, and placed it in the wooden candlestick on the table. The two were so busy in their talk that they did not notice what Handy-Teddy was about until the fumes of burning grease annoyed them. 44 What tho deuce is this smell? Surely this idiot has not been trying to burn the place down again," said Will. Arthurs kicked his leg, and pointed to the stove, where Teddy was on his knees ramming the second candle into the coals, puffing at and cursing it for a "contherary candle that wouldn't light." 44 What arc you trying to do there, Teddy?" nuked Will. 44 Share, it's thrying to light this blessed caudle I am, sir�bad cess to it." 4' Is tlicre not a candle already alight ?" 41 bedad �an'so there is; I forgot that," said Teddy, rising from his kneeling posture with the remnant of the obdurate candle in his hand, which was almost covered with melted fat, his eyes streaming with water, and almost scorched from his head. 44 Bad cess to ye for a candle ! 'Tis nearly blinded I am." The others laughed. 44 That fellow will never mend," said Arthurs. " He will be an idiot to the end of the chapter." 441 am not so sure of that," said Will. 44 He ia cunning enough in some things." Toddy disappeared �in search of a fresh candle, as they supposed. He returned in a few minutes with the candle which he had been trying to ignite, shorn of its fair proportions, in one hand, and a wisp of brown paper daubed with grease in the other; upon which a repetition of the former scene took place. 44What in thunder arc you trying to do?" roared Boolger. 44 Shurc am n't I trying to light the candles till I jjet ye ycr tayV" 14 Cannot you light one candle from another, you born idiotV" But the fat had fallen on Teddy's hands and scalded thorn. Flinging candle and paper down with a cur."f, he ruxhed out and was seen no more. Will and Arthurs were compelled to seek tho materials for their own 44tay " Aa 

 the viands were of the simplest, that proceeding did not entail much trouble. In the morning Teddy had forgotten his trouble, and went about his work aa usual. As Lcysid had calculated on being detained some time at this camp, ho had caused a fire* place to be built of stones and clay, as well for the convenience of the cook as to prevent their being forced to consume more than their share of dust with their food. In an open fire this is unavoidable. Some mornings after this Boolger ordered Teddy to melt the fat which had accumulated, and was offensive. So Teddy slung his largest pot and commenced opera* tions. The proceeding was so simple that Boolger thought the fellow surely could manage it without being watched. He was writing in the tent, which was about ten yards from the fireplace or galley, when he heard a roar as of �rass burning. "Bush fire" was his first lought, and ne ran out, to see the galley en veloped in a mass of flame and a body rolling about on the ground, from which proceeded curses loud and long on everything an inch high and an hour old. The fat was blazing and sputtering away in an unaccountable manner. " What is it now, you torment ?" said Will. 44 Oh, Mr. Bulgin, I'm ruined for life. Me eves is burned out iv me head, and divil resave the bit of hair is left at all at all. Holy mother I look at the state I'm in. Damn the fat and the, fire. The Lord forgive me. Me heavy curse on you, Tom Burns, for a desaving thief. Oh ! Melia murder; 'tis dark (blind) I am. May I niver see grace hut I'll put a crooked straw in your bed, Tom Burns, for this," &c. Boolger seized an old woolsack and covered the pot, when the flames were at once extin guished. He then turned his attention to Teddy, to examine his injuries. " Get up," said he. and let me see your eyes." 44 Oh! Mr. Bulgin, just luk at me oncst. Me mother would not know me. 'Tis ruined intirely I am," said Teddy, covering his face with his hands, and wriggling his body about like an eel. 44 Don't touch me or I'll lent." 441 will chance that. Get up, and let me look at your face," said Will, impressing bis speech by a tolerably hard kick. This had the effect of rousing Teddy. [TO BE CONTINUED.]
