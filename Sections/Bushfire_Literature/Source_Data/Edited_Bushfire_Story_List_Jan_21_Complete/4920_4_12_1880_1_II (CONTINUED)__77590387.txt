 Walter. 

 I don't think so " said, Victor,. eva sively. "Look, there,ia Grant's PalnceJ" 

 On the pebbly -hillside there. -w�s a shanty of an extraordinary:. description. It might haye done for :a dog-kennel, but no lover of his hound should have,thought .them well disposed of in it. What the original materials were of ,!which tbe hut was built no one could tell, for now it was patched up with zinc, iron,' tin, bark, bags, and other things. The chimney was of 

 tin, and had a lean-over look,'as if it \\ would tumble at any ? moment 5. yet - old Gritians averred that, it had been in.'the same condition since they rememberedi 

 Young fellows, upon whose chins the down ; had begun "to show, recollected "Grant's Palace" aa an early reminiscence of their childhood j indeed, young Gritians, when engaged in " Bhanghaing'*' wattle birds, had often, frora a safe entrenchment in the eoTub, delivered a shot or two ;with Btones at the hut, just to' hear the Old . znan 

 .-swear. ,i ... 

 As they passed, Walter looked jnt the miserable aboda with feelings of indignation. For a rich man to hoaird up his money, and so live in eo wratohed a orip^ when be should build a handsome mansion and give em ployment to the men whorrhakl heipedi 1o make his money,-he'thought Ut.l6 Bbort .ofia

 " Pah 1" aaid Walter, as they entered a ffclind gully, well wooded; 'i I'm glwi . wp ihave lost sight of the .place; it makes me sick. I wonder, Victor, if yqu: com� into ids fortune,;if it will change your,nature,",

 As if by instinct they halted on a graBsy Mil, lightly timbered, nvhich commanded a splendid . view of Grit. At this time of the year'the bush-fir ea which oocur fill the atmosphere with a mystic haae, which Refines and poetises the mo?t..nniomantic bct^oery. Gtit, therefore, waa; seen from thia town'i^ence as if throueh a veil of cloudy gauze, ana w&s etherealised. Far away it Beeme'd tbe 7oofs glistening in the sun light, the1 street� resembling ribbons of dull orange, wbii'j & pbantom' efccc. was given by the column'.? of d.rk emoke. that roee from countless et^^s, drifting lazily in the air, into which the}" ^�d gradually, settling as a grov cloud' tipO11 , e?

 'landmark were rounded off'into olc^nnce. It was a dream-like scene-a Turner ian^' ,=acape. �-?*I 

 " What an air o� repose everything in 

 | Grit wears," said Victor. " As we lool 

 upon ifc now. we axe led to believe that it ii a Dream. Valley, and jet' the ceaseless rounc of life goes on there ; the miners toi underneath the earth; the landers scurry backwards and forwards with their tracks 

 ^irertfiouHand stampers clang and thump the pumps plunge and bring up their rust of water; the Beehive is ail activity, anc the'brokers and speculators shout and swear and cheat; and all the rush anc turmoil of life is there. Doe3 not this 

 remind you, Walter, of other aspects oi life ? How often we contemplate some position in life whose possessors seem out wardly so peaceful and calm; do we not covet some beautiful home where eternal peace appears to reign; and yet, when we penetrate them, we discover the canker worm of misery, unrest, and turmoil is ae rampant there as in our own positions and 

 homed." 

 " Very well Applied," replied Walter ; "and yon might instance tbe idea we of the j bnsy city have of nature. Happy bind8, - we say, and yet I warrant these feathered gentlemen- and ladies have as unquiet a life a% we, searching .for worms (we call ours gold), fighting for nesta (ours we dub property), and suffering tb� pan^a of . disappointed love. In nature there is 90 pence, no rest; her molecules, be they man, beast, or earrhj are ever in motion." 

 " And yet I almost feel as if I couid stop here forever," replied Vic'or. "When 1 look around, ifc remind* me of the Inspired 

 Dreamer's Land of Beulah." 

 It was a bountiful spot, that glorious, I balmy, epnng day. A tender green grass 

 covered tbe rounded slope with t� verdant carpet, from which, here and there, peeped out orohids of every description, deep blue, purple and white; while on the brow, heaths, with red and white blossom's, perfumed ttoe air with their pure waxsn bldome. Tne rioh yellow bloesoin tipped with dark red of the brooms, the drooping fronds of the parasol flower, the dark purple, tipped with white atara, of the star daisy, as it is known in Grit, the rioh golden hoe of the buttercups and immortelles, varied the parterre; while in'the moister spots the delicate rose pink blossoms of the sundew were open, inviting heedless' insects to their deadly oops, and rnterspersedhere and there were wattle-trees cne mass of gold, diffusing the 'richest fragranoe. In the gully itself, invited by the moist soil,-grew beds of native violets, as they are popularly named, without scent, it i8 true, but forming maasee of rioh purple, that would have made a bed for Psyohe, albeit a damp one. At the head of . the gaily, where Victor atld Walter sat down to diecQBs their lunoh, there was a reservoir of clear cold water, on the brink' uf which gTew yellow water-lilca. This reservoir had been made years before by some miners who had found a reef there, The dam wafe bnili and machinery erected, but they had hardly got to .work properly when the rtef died out, and, after-losing ail their money, the miners left, and the machine was taken away. No evidence of former aotivity now remained but the deserted shaft, and the traoeB of where the; machinery had once stood, all of wbiah were overgrown with thistles, and noxious weeds. Our tourists halted tinder a huge gum-tree olose to the water/ whose shade waB grateful after toiling up the arid 

 langea, 

 . Victor; opened the basket and brought out) his treasures, laying them on a cloth on th� grass.'Very daintily had everything been prepnied, and the edibleB were wrapped in snowy lintn. All bore evidence of a woman's loving hand. The bottle of Ten pant's was opened, and the two youths set to with an appetite boin of exercise and the mpuntain air, and they were not long in mating the " banquet" look "mean," bb Victor jocosely remarked. While eating, a | saucy native wren with a red breapt, who bad ! detected the good things, kepi hopping ; round them, and when Victor threw it a crumb it hopped off to a twig, where, how ever, it was attacked by another bitd, who got possession of the morsel. Just then two Uoghing-jackaaBes, who were perched on a bough, their heads on one side, with that look. of , supernatural cannineBs which is their characteristic, let off a hearty guffaw. 

 " Fit emblem of society," laughed Viotor. " The strongest takes from the weakest, and the world laughs." 

 " You are quite a moralist to-day," said Walter. " I hope your philoeophy will h�lp you to keep away from Began'*, for I think it is dangerous. Dan Kagan is no man to play with." 

 " What a tease you are, Walter," replied 

 Victor.' " I' think I will go down ana see th^ old'people and Rise; it's so abusing. You1 know I don't mean anything Berious." 

 il Yet it may become serious," siiid Walter. "What is that?" he allied, Victor cleared d&'t the basket and a phial fell out." 

 ? "That's chloroform,"was the reply. "It will be useful if we come across danger jous specimens." 1 'l ?? '"Well, what do"you;say to la bathe?" queried Waltfer. " Th^'water lbokii ao cool and inviting,'" S'J

 Tne two were soon1 m the %a^r, dWng ; arid gaidbolitjg about, and creating miniatture cascade's'"'wittt their'feet, chasing each otherJ from bank tot Lank, and otherwise enjoying themselves as' only the young can. Presently ihey came to the bank, and stretched on the grata to dry themselves. They appeared to have entirely fornotten the exciting eventa of the morning.' A splendid ^picture they made lying lazily in the shadow of the tree, in all the freedom of arcatia, 

 ? All enjoyments, however, have an end, and so Ixad theirs. They were chatting merrily, and Victor had lit a choice cigar, when Walter, after looking on one side, gave a startled shoat, and leaped at least) three 

 feet into the air. 

 " What the deuce is the matter ?" cried .Victor, springing up, and looking be 

 wildered, , 

 . y" Matter I" said Walter. " Can't yon oee ? I t's no wonder the jackasses were on the , tree, for they have . evidently, been watching it, for Eome time." \\ , 

 ,'f What is it?", asked Victor. 

 Can't you see ?" said Walter. "Where's your eyes ? Don't you Bee the snake lying coiled there, quite close to where Hay."' 

 Victor looked, and. an expression of horror Btole.over his face as he saw a short, thick enake, of a dull brown hue, coiled up just outsiae the shade of the tree, in the sun. > At firBt glance one would fancy it a piece of stick. It was now alarmed, and raased its head out of the coils occasionally, darling out a forked tongue, and snapping its head from side to Bide. The body of jbhe serpent was very thick, while the head .wa9 small and spade shaped, the neck being thin. They were BO close to the creature that they could Bee its baleful, yellow eye flashing amber fire from around a black, longitudinal pupil. As it opened its horrid mouth, the curved poison fange were displayed. Shortly it uncoiled with an angry hiss, and flattening its body watched the two youths, snapping from eide to side. It was not a long snake possibly eighteen inches or two feet ii length, but very stout of body. Imagina tion could not conceive anything so horric in appearance. The head was hideous ai anytcuig :Bee# ig the distempered drean 

 of a 'maniac. "" '" <V 

 j < �'.Keep away/' ^id to 

 " that is the'mo3t "deadly of all serpents j it is a death-^dder,1 the aeontKophis an-, taretica." ' ' ' : '-L ,1' 

 "I'll acanthofhis him,", said Walter, making a rush for a stick that lay near by. 

 "No, no, don't," said Victor; "ifc_ is, the rarest of serpents in these parts, and I 

 mean to catch it." . 

 "Catch a death-adder 1" said Walter. "Why, don't you know that its bite is fatal in twenty minutes, and^ there is no remedy known that will cure it/' ?; 

 "I'll find a remedy, however,' said! Victor. " Give me that stick, and I'll soon show you the extent of my ri. purees." : 

 Walter pushed the stick, which was of a good length, towards him, and Victor seized it. The serpent was all this time snapping angrily, moving its head from side to side, and keeping its yellow eyes upon the intruders. Victor went to the basket, pulled but some Berlin wool, which, he stuck upon the stick, and he then poured upon the woolBome of the chloro- j form in the phial. Quick as thought he reached this end of the stick to the death adder, which raised its horrid head to strike at it. But no sooner. did the powerful essence invade the serpent's nostriiB, than,, with a quiver or two, it sank down on the earth motionless.. . j 

 " Now, let us dress quickly," said Victor. And in a short time their ? garments had been resumed, and Walter felt more, courage, for boots and dress were some 

 defence. ? 

 "I wouldn't go near the brute for: worlds," said Walter, "and I"wouldadvi6e you to leave it alone., Bgtnember how Drummond died through fooling; with. these j reptiles." .'� . " v 

 " I would not care if I did die, ? replied j Victor, moodily; ?'I "would, be as' ,.welli 

 dead as alive." � ; ' . - 

 Walter laughed. , - i " What I You, the pet of everyone, talk-j ing of death.. Pahawl; you'vegot the; bluea." > - --- --v. ! 

 Perhaps,said Victor, in. a low tone., and in an abstracted manner, " there is; some truth in dreams, after alL" 

 " You don't mean to say you've been; dreaming of serpents ?" queried Walter, y 

 " I had a strange dream last night," said: Victor, in-the same depressed tone. " I thought I was in a magnificent garden, where all the delights of the senses that men can have were mine, when, Btiddenly, clouds obscured the eky, -the beautiful garden vanished, and withit all tbat pleased the senses. Hound myself in a wilderness, and was suddenly embiaced in the folds of a hideous terpent. Ugh! how like this looks to the phantom of my dream. It killed me, and my last recollection of the dream was my spirit gazing clown upon the bloated and horrid body in which it once had its habitation." y ^ 

 " Late suppers,' said Walter, cynically. "The best recipe to raise "hobgbblins, better even than Owen Glendower's magic, is a pork cbop, with a slice of German sausage, before going to bed." t ? 

 " Always the case,'' replied Victdr; *' the comic ttnd the tragic are inseparable. Had the death-adder bitten you there -would have been a tragedy ; as it is, we:must have presented a comic spectacle. But here goes 

 to secure the gentleman." 

 " Do so," Baid. Walter, "but I won't help to carry the basket." . 

 "It cannot sting through this," said Victor, tapping the basket, the withes of , which were so close as to make the con 

 . struction appear almost solid. 

 Again Victor resorted to the chloroform, and applied it to the death adder's head. He then used the Btick to place the basket on its side, near the. set pent, and ingeni ously thruot the creature into it with the stick; then fae righted the basket, after, which he approached and locked it. 

 " There," said he; " I defy it to hurt any one now. They're, very sluggish creatures, and want a lot of .rousing to do evil. Now, 'Walter, we'll leave it here, and take ft stroll to old Regan's farm, juBt to get some 

 milk." . - t - ;. 

 " To see EoBe, you mean," Baid Walter. " Maybe," replied Victor; " anything to get rid of my thoughts. That tiling; in the basket has given my mind .a strange 

 turn.'' 

 " Kill it, then," said Walter. . " You'll come to harm over it." .' . i 

 " Not I," answered Victor. " It's not the first tiine I've dealt with the tribe. I once eent a snake through the post to Professor M'Coy, and the post-office authorities, not liking the look of the parcel, opened it. There was a fine scamper when the snake popped out, I tell yon, and yet it was as narmless as a mosquito. Don't eay a word j about my capture; we'll give a fright to 

 some of the old ones. But, come along; I want to collect a few ferns, and to see the Begans. You're done out of your prey this time, iny feathered friendB," he added, addressing the jackasses,-who'were still torched on the! bough; "but, no doubt, you'll find another before sundown." ;
