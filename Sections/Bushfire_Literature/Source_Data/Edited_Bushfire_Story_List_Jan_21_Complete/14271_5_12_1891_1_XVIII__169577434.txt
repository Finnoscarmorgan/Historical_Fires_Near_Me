 �Come and I will show you the doctor's photo. He is taken with five snakes alive, all darting, about, only kept prisoners by his hands and feet,� said 

 Mrs. Fortescue. � Bat the jollieat ? story 1 know was when we woreon a visit .to the Dunmorcs. Mra. Dunmoro hodo pot snake sho used to keep in a . fish � globe covered up in a possurh rug, and at a party they had one night, I, , leaning against the concern, it suddenly gave with a. crash,. and then it dawned upon us that the snake would get out. By jove I what a commotion. The women shrieked and the men turned blue, and wo all jumped on chairs, afraid even to leave the room. After sundry pokes with a poker, and sundry plunges.with a fish ing rod, in trying to haul up the rug, we managed it, and found the poor brute had never even moved. The glass had only given way at the top. The scene, I can tell you, can be - imagined, the.� women with all their dresses tucked;-round their legs, eyes gazing with horrors,� said Nor man, flinging on to the back verandah a pile of game and fish that would haver done credit to a party of English sports men. ' CHAPTER XIX. bBILDnOOD. �I am fond of children, 1 think them tho poetry of the world; tho fresh - flowers of our hearths ond homos.; little con jurors with their natural magic work ing by their spells what delights and enriches all ranks, and equalises the different classes'of society; . ' � I am sure they are.atsomo mischief,� eald Mrs. Fortescue, tapping - quickly at the schoolroom door,; .which she ; found locked one morning, as she was going iuto the garden with Lord Yereker, � Enter milord,� said Ernie in a mock tragic voice, opening-the door quickly and bowing, as his mother with .her com panion entered. �Oh! what a dreadful smell of mioe,� said Mrs. - Fortescue. � It�s not me,� said Dicky; � it�s Ellio 6 York, Lord Newry and the Duke.

Ory not for the raooh ; your tears can do ye no good,� said Ernie.. � Do you remember the regatta� Ernie�s regatta? Oh, do tell Lord Vere ker ail about it,' �twos such fun,� said little Euid, sitting bolt upright, as if about to say a lesson. � If you won�t, I will�what do you think ?� . , � Give her some victuals and give her some drink,��said Dicky, �You rude boy 1 We were oil down at Muddlecum,� said Enid. � You should say, � And it came to pass that we were,� � said Dicky. �If you interrupt I won�t go on. Well, one day Ernie said, * Let us get up a re gatta.� So we went to all the ladies and gentlemen wp knew there, and asked them for money�not much, you know, a shilling or two shillings � ' �Opened a subscription list you should say,� said Ernie, � amongst the aristo cratic society of Muddlecum,� � Muddb cum�where�s Muddlecum,� said Lord Yereker.� � Oh, the jollieat place out, at least for boys,� said Ernie. �Well, Miss Fortescue, I am all at tention,� said Lord Yereker. / . � And so one afternoon about four o�clock the regatta was to bo down at the creek.� ' �To come off,� said Dicky; � And we all went (the four boys and me) with Miss Edwards, our governess, you know; but just os wo left our house a whole lot of other boys joined the boys with their and very soon a whole long string of them, just like a school.� � Yes, and didn�t,Miss Edwards' blush just/ 1 said Dicky. � No wonder 1 Poor Miss Edwards to find herself headbd ; by a procession of boys of all kinds�good boys, bad boys, town, boys, country boys, all laden with boats It was trying for the good little soul. ; I felt rather abashed myself, and as for you, Enid, you looked as if you Wore going to b'ry,� said' Ernie, � : � Well; even the people inthe shops stared,� said she, � as wo paraded through the street down the bill�such a lo*, ; nearly forty, X think, altogether.� , " Well,; how did it go off, Miss Portes cue,� said L6rd Yereker;.� looking in terested. '' � Alas I� said Ernie; � brotherly love (lid not continue.�'' � � ",� il � No; thby all squabbled so.

He -had forgotten about the string altogether until Ernie asked* .-him for it again, at which Lord* Yereker soon brought some to light, and in' doing so, said, - � What�s all this in the bottom of the cupboard ?� hauling,tip some thin yellow white fungus looking stuff. �Hush, sh, sb,� said Dicky. �Now mother�s gone we will let. you into our secret. We were busy getting up a ghost just to frighten- the ' maids. Its punk�a sort of- fungus that lights up at nights�and we stick it up in the shape of a. man and put it in a dark corner of' the garden, and it glares alb round and looks ghastly. Such jolly iun. You�ll hear scream after scream. We did it at Muddlccum, and old Mrs. Winder ran all the way down the street nearly into the sea with fright�with nothing on.� �Oh fie!� said Dicky. Fie, fie; stick to the truth.�- * ; - � , i ? I � Well, I mean with no bonnet or | cloak�nothing but her indoor clothes,�� said Ernie, blushing. I It was late that night after the ghost [entertainment when the children went 1 to bed, and Ernest Fortescue' was left reading by himself, as was often the case. The lad was pouring over a new book of adventures Miss Vavasour � had lately added to the children�s library at Seringa, when with a gentle tap at the .door Lord Yereker entered:- { * � Hall, old boy, still reading. 11 thought it was you when 1 saw � the light� � Yes, I couldn�t/sleep till I saw how it all ended. A splendid story-;�quito thrilling�the adventures/� � Is smoking allowed: here/� said Lord Yereker. * :�.� Oh yes, as far as visitors are con cerned, and a delightful exchange for the smell of those horrid mice/�.said'Ernie, shutting up his book, delighted at the" honor of such a visit, for Lord Yereker was a great favorite with all the children, more particularly Ernie, who was more companionable, and Lord ; Yereker being yoaug in thought and feeling, entered' into all the ideas and amusements of young people, so the two became �great chums,� as Ernie expressed it in his own fashion. They, talked of adventures, sports of all kinds, Lord Yereker quite surprised at the boy�s intelligence. t ? � Well, good nigh Void fellow. I hope your governor will bring you to England, and you will look mo r up.�� f Ernie looked more than pleased, for he knew the young lord meant what he said. . - � � They said good night, then the visitor halted for a,moment, and trying- to look nonchalant,said, �Oh, by-the-by, Ernie, that little photo of�of�of�your aunt, may I have it f� . � Aunt Vavasour,� said Ernie, with a twinkle of his blue eyes mischievously. . �No, the other; in fact I didn�t see one of Miss Vavasour,� said Lord Vero kcr. � You don�t wont it, you cm easily get another. The fact is 1 am -'making a collection of .photos of people I.have-roeL- ; Eh.! can you spare it! Really.�; , � Yes, you shall have it. I have two or perhaps 1 I shouldn�t be quite so generous. Do you want it now.� - ' �If you can spare it,� � Ob, yes; don�t tell Enid, she always twits me if 1 give anything away that has been given me, but I know you* will take care of. Aunt Vera�s portrait,� said Ernie, going to a drawer and taking out a case, � . 1 � Is this the same as the one I�yes, I see it is. Thanks, very many thanks. I won�t forget my ? promise of the .other day ; I mean the small rifle � � I have never thought about it since. I am afraid mother would not let me use use it' yet,� said Ernie, a shadow of doubt coming over his young face. �Oh, yes, I�ll tell her. all about'it; Its quite safe. A small child might fire it off safely, and it would just he the thing for you. Good night, Ernie.� � I will come with you part of the' way/� said Ernie, locking the door of the schoolroom and shading his candle with his hand as they came on to the verandah, and Lord Yereker tossing away the half of his cigar, walked briskly to his room;' saying good night to his young friend, who had refused to enter and keep his lordship up. Then sitting down ;in a comfortable chair, Lord Yereker took out his newly; acquired possession and looked, at it for �ome time, then closet) the 1 case: and tliought on and on, till the small hours came in�then with a sigh he gave up his reverie. What was the sigh for? There seemed np reason for Lord (Vereker�sdespondency, for himself or bis new friend, "Mrs. Anne laye: , He, the second; son of a; wealthy �English duke, gifted with alb the gifts requisite,to i make life 'perfect; i she,* the ideal of perfection, perfect ly happy in her adoring her husband ; �what was the sigh for? wherefore, Echo answers�wherefore.

It was getting on towards .the middle of Fobrua'y very hot, for the. summer had come in with a run, os if to make up for the past deficiencies .in-the Way of heat; which had become' almost unbear able in its scorching properties i Bush fires were doing havoc on the neighboring runs, increasing the beat at; Seringa by hot puffs, as; if - from a furnac�!l wafted across from the confl <gatiuns, to gether with a hot wind blowing fiercely. There: was no going oat ofdoors. Every one tried to keep cool by religiously rc mainihg inside, in <the;<cool dark cue i rooms of both house and cottage. Herbert Annelaye hadfelt the heat more than anyone., He looked ill and had boon njupfi depressed. in .spirbs of la*e. Mrs. Annelaye know that her bus band had been much disappointed at gett ing no ,homo letters at Christmas. nor oven sjoco, though, jhe bad sa|d little about it; not even alluding to his' disap pointment.

Together they wont into the glen, whereiin a shady spot near the /stream/ which was trickling but �sparingly, they sat down together on a soft, mossy Jmnk, shaded by the wattles and leaning against an bid lurrajong tree. Mr. Annelaye was ''unusually silent for a time. , � Vera, darling,� he said, after a long silence, �do you remember the Yaletta at Malta, when I joined the Kashmir.� -?* � Yes, dear, perfectly, T Shall never forget it Your face, worse than , sad, the image of diapair, Aunt Dorothy was so shocked at seeing you,she said your face haunted her for hoars after,� said Yera. �Your aunt had reason to bo sorry for me,. for I was in the� lowest depths of despair, it was the breaking np of ray life/that great trouble, and'but for you, nay brave loving little wife,.! should have succumbed long ago. � I loved you from the very first moment I caught sight of you waving your hand ito some old friends of yours, as the boat steamed out of harbor at Malta, and yet I have been cruel and unjust in never, opening my heart and telling you of ray, trouble, the blight of oil my hopes and life, I ought never to have had a secret from my dar ling, but I was a coward, fearing, my oon* : fession would change you, love, but you shall know ail and you will never blame me. It was five years ago, or rather more, now I think of it, a brother officer with whom I�. Hark, there are the children, I will toll you to night, �dearest, when the litte one are asleep and all is quiet.� � Dolly, Dolly,� said happy little voices through the glon, as the little ones, caught sight of their mother and came' running to her. � Oh, Dolly, t�in so hqt and thirsty, pleaso got me some water.� � No, dearies, your tea is ready, and dubh a nice cake from Aunt Conniq for Puck�s birthday.

A kiss all round to his little one?, �one for little mpther,� he said lovingly, and Mr. Annelaye was off with his gun, Vera, as usual assisting in the pleasant duty of putting*tho children to bed. A beau*iful picture was that in. the nursery soon after�the beautiful young mother with her fair girlish face teaching her last born little baby girl to walk up her chest, the child crowing with delight, as she cautiously, stop after step, placed the i little dimpled feet firmly down, trusting ;to the firm bold of her little hands and guidance by the mpther, whose beaming face was a picture, and so thought some one who was looking in the window�a dork looking face,and darker still in the shadow,of the passion flower and other roreepers under tho ver<Ttfffah7"~ ; As he watched the group and took' in the. whole scene even to little Puck trying to'float his tiny shoe in the bath, slily peeping up now and then at bis mother nurse to see if he-was found out. --- A heavy stop on the boarded floor out side, and a top at the door with a riding whip The servant opened the door. � Is the captain in,� said a voice. �The captain, what captain?� ques tioned the maid. � Is� Mr. Annelaye in ?� said the stranger, correcting himself. �I�ll see,� said tho servant, always cautious of tramps, as she said after wards. But Vera had-heard the stop and was very anxious to know who the stranger, was. In af. or years she often remembered how more'than anxious she had been that night tb see the stranger and know his errand. - �I wish to see Mr,, Annelaye, particu larly! 1 have a very important message from England for hid; but only for him!� Mrs. Annelaye was taken aback with, alarm, but she summoned up courage to. Say sweetly, �I am so sorry Mr. Anne layo is hot in. Ho has gone down to the swamp. Wo will be Horae in a very short time. Will you come in and sit down.� The stranger, declined politely, arid Yeraroturncd to the nursery, whore, ' niter 1 seeing all the little ones fast asleep, she assisted'the nurse in putting a few things away, and then went .out on to the verandah to watch and wait for her husband. : j � and ijte will be back soon,� she said toy herself, �or I would run ap and see how Connje has pf! her to send down the chickens; Bertie will q-j/y his dinner after'bts long fast to day. ; I wonder who .that wag ; I did not like His face/but one bah' never judge by faces.
