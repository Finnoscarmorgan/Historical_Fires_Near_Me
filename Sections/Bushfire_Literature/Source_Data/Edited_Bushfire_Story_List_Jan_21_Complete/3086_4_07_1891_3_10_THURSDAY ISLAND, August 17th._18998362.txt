 CHAPTER X. 

 THURSDAY ISLAND, 

 August 17th. 

 During the last ten days we have been ploughing our uneventful way through the southern seas. And now, this morning, we are anchored at Thurs- day Island, the most northerly point of the Queensland dominions. We came up the Straits in the light of a starry sky, having passed Booby Island the same day. Here we were at last, within the magic zone�the land of gold and of bananas. Our vessel lies at the distance of about a mile from the shore, and as the red sun leaps up out of the eastern wave, we gaze with feelings of mixed re- pulsion and curiosity on the hot, sun-scorched hills, and the dried up herbage of this tropic island. We have one passenger, a carpenter, who is to go ashore at this place ; and as the terrible heat of the sun increases with each hour that passes, we commiserate him heartily, and are glad it is he, and not us, who must land on the island. 

 A shore boat comes off to the vessel, and as she nears us we notice there are a couple of Kanakas at the oars ; while at the stern a very aristocratic looking individual is seated, under an awning of white cloth, and the smoke from his cigar is trail- ing behind in his wake, giving the impression that 

 the craft is a miniature steamboat. 

 Presently the boat comes alongside, and the occupant�for of course the darkies don't count� trots up the ladder, and disappears into the deck cabin. He is a young man of the tall, bored- looking, don-cher-know persuasion, and is dressed in white boating flannels, made to fit loosely, and wears a smart official cap, such as is worn by our railway men, only over so much smarter, and it is carefully draped with many folds of a snow- white puggaree. As he came over the side, he cast a glance of lofty contempt on all who were near, and slung the stump of his cigar over his shoulder. The red end of it hit Jock Ramage on the nose, but our noble visitor did not seem offended in the least, and before Jock had time to apologise he had entered the cabin. We all heaved separate sighs of relief, and Jock rubbed the hot ash off his nose, 

 and remarked : 

 "I'll bet ye drinks that's the Governor o' Queenslaund." 

 "The Govurnor o' hell, more loike," muttered the indignant Connor, profanely. "If I thought the Govurnor o' Quaneslan' had as little breedin' as that whelp, I'd dhrown mesilf afore I'd land in the counthry he ruled ; an' if I'd as little sperit as ye hev, Jock, I'd do it enyway." 

 "Whit wis ye waantin' me tae dae, Connor ?" "Bang him over the mouth, av coorse !" 

 "Weel, ye see, Connor," said Jock, reflectively, "a body disna ken whit tae dae in sic cases. He micht be somebody o' consequence, ye see, an�" 

 "Yis, yis," blurted Jan, "jist as ye say, Jock ; it might be someone who had a right to burn yer nose wid his cigar, an' ye wor best not to risint it." 

 There was a world of satire in Jan's voice as he concluded, and the glance he cast on puir Jock was enough to annihilate him. It didn't, however. The effect of Jan's address was altogether different on Ramage. He edged over to me, and enquired 

 "Wha d'ye think he is, Tam ?" 

 "The postman," I answered promptly. "You ought to have got him by the neck, Jock, and made him apologise." 

 My answer was a random one, but was correct for all that, and when, five minutes later, the bored looking gentleman again made his appearance he carried in his hand the leather mail bags of the 

 settlement. 

 "Here, you !" said Jock, stepping up and seizing him by the coat collar ; "are ye aware ye threw this burnin' seegaur i' ma face and brunt ma 

 nose ?" 

 "Wha�what d'ye mean, fellow ?" stormed the exquisite, gasping and turning pale. "Remove your hands, or I'll have you whipped." 

 "Are ye gaun tae apologise for burnin' my nose, or are ye no ?" enquired Jock, grimly. 

 "Le' me go, fellow !" "A weel ; take that." 

 Jock had been puffing at the cigar end till it was in a red glare, and as he spoke he jobbed it on the chaste nose of the struggling man. A wild shriek of pain and fear rang out over the ship, and the next instant the surgeon and officers were down off the bridge and enquiring into the cause of the row. This was briefly given them, and then the captain stuck his hands into his pockets and retired without uttering a single word, while the surgeon, as he followed him, muttered very distinctly�" Serve the whelp dam well right." The outraged dandy cast one look of baffled spleen on the various groups, and then, seeing Jock again drawing near, he seized his mail bags and took his singed nose over the side, a wild chorus of derisive laughter following him to the shore. 

 This little incident put us all in good humour during the remainder of our stay of two hours ; and, when we at length weighed anchor and stood out from the land, we had still the picture of the burnt-nosed civil servant in our mind's eye, and enjoyed the same very much. Connor was now all admiration of Jock's pluck, and voted him a regular 

 "brick." 

 During our stay we had a visit from the Govern- ment Resident, and a nice old gentleman he was. The individual with the burned nose cannot have 

 complained to him, for he spoke to us quite affably, and welcomed us to Queensland waters in a hearty, jovial way. I was, as usual, on the hunt for infor- mation, and, in reply to my questions, he told me there was a population of 70 whites and 300 coloured people on the island, and that it was a very hot place indeed, but a grand place to live when one got used to it. When he went ashore our unfortunate carpenter accompanied him-for unfortunate we still considered him to be, although we knew he was engaged for one year at fifteen shillings per day. Thursday Island is the most desolate and forbidding place I ever recollect seeing, and I would not reside on its sulphurous looking shores for �2000 a year. For, as far as we could see it astern, the white quivering haze of a parch- ing desert was rising over it, and the red gleam of the scorched hills met our weary eyes. 

 On the following morning we met the pilot steamer Wongo, and had twenty labourers put on board to assist at discharging cargo at the various ports along the coast. Then the pilot took charge of the vessel, and our new friends, the labourers, proceeded to make themselves at home on the for- ward part of the upper deck. They slung ham- mocks in every available place, and then proceeded to get breakfast, all the time uttering strange, yet somehow familiar, sounds as the operation pro- ceeded. Deeply interested, we loitered near the distinguished strangers, feeling in our hearts that we'd give millions to possess their insouciance and cheek, and, as from time to time the strange gutturals reached our ears, we thought to ourselves, "Well, after all, this Australian language seems strangely familiar. It won't be difficult to pick it up." One of the distinguished foreigners now came close to where Jan and I were standing, and proceeded to make fast his swing hammock on a pin 

 in the gunwale. Another of them had his eye on this particular pin also, and he, evidently thinking the said pin might hold both hammocks, came over and started to hang his on it too. Then the first distinguished foreigner turned on the new one and 

 howled : 

 "Wha-tha-blazes ur yu dooin ?" And the other remarked : 

 "Slingin' me hammuk ! Cud ye hindther it ?" "I cud, an' will." 

 "Le'me see ye do it, thin." 

 "I will! Off wid ye! Beyaff !" 

 The two happy Australians then got in grips, and embraced fervently, and only ceased their affec- tionate demonstrations when they were completely out of wind and had been forcibly separated by the entire strength of all the other happy Austra- lians on board. But a new, glad light was now shining in Connor's eye, and, when the little inci- dent was over, he said to me : 

 "Tom, I knows uvvery word they was sayin'. They're not foreigners at all, but Irishmen, an' they were havin' a good, sensible fight about where they'd hang their hammocks. Och, me sowl ! They're gintilmin, Tom, an' I musht go an' make their aquintins. Mebbe they kin tell me somethin' about me uncle Failix who was sint� who kem to this counthry 30 years ago." 

 Jan left me to prosecute his praiseworthy en- quiries, and I may state that I saw little more of him that day. He was signally fortunate in finding a couple of men among the happy Australians who had heard of his uncle. They told him the old man 

 had died at the end of a rope out Pimpana way some 15 years ago, but that he had lived a long and successful ten years in the bush, and all that time in defiance o' the Guvurmint. Jan was much com- forted, and also very proud of this prompt in- formation, and resolved to take to the bush as soon as ever he landed, "an' be agin the Guvurmint too." I had to promise him that I would take up arms in the same righteous cause, and this being duly arranged we felt more happy. 

 On the evening of the 18th of August our eyes first rested on the mainland of the great Australian Island, and a great cheer rose from our decks and was wafted out over the sunny waves. This was our new home at last : the land of the golden fleece and the subject of our dreams for many days. We feasted our eyes on the wooded hills and cheered again, and as the sun dropped in the western forests we let go our anchor and swung round to the tide 

 one mile out from Cooktown. 

 Wednesday, August 20th. 

 We have been lying at anchor off Cooktown during the last two days, and have discharged a vast quantity of cargo into lighters that came out to us to receive it. Our mails were taken off by a smart little Government steamer immediately on our arrival, and I understand she will distribute them at the various ports southward�as there is no railway service on this part of the coast. Cook- town does not seem to be of much importance as a town, as from what we can see of it, it seems small and straggling and there are not many large houses visible. Our happy family is now breaking up terribly, and at this place forty people have left us to tread the shore of the new land. We took an almost affectionate farewell of these exiles and wished them God speed, and then we laughed till our sides were sore as we saw the unique way in which they were dismissed. As I have already stated, our large vessel was unable to go close in- shore, so everything was transferred to the small lighters, and as there was a heavy surf running�I fancy there always is�even the lighters could not get close to our plunging vessel, but had to lie off a few yards and have the goods sent down on to their low decks by means of revolving derricks� that is, cranes that swing out over them. It some- times happened that when the order to "Lower away" was given the lighter was rising on a great wave, and then the bump that the box or package got on the dock was simply a caution. When it came to the passengers' turn a big hamper was rigged on the crane, and in this �ten at a time, they were transferred to the shore boat. I need not assure the reader that they met with the same vicissitudes and mishaps as did the baggage, and out of the four hamper loads we sent ashore, three of them were spilled out on the deck like so much ballast. It was great fun, and we enjoyed it prodigiously, but our feelings under- went a slight change when a little later a nice chair was rigged on the same whip, and one of our saloon passengers was gently deposited�after considerable waiting for a favourable moment�on the deck of the lighter. Three or four sailors gently steadied him over our ship's side, and three or four more received the growling dandy on nis arrival, and thus, even here, was the mighty power of caste again made manifest. 

 "By G�d !" growled a stalwart miner from Northumberland, who had been watching the pro- ceedings, "that's too much. Let anyone jest think o' how they imptied the poor women and children on the deck o' that boat, and then see the care they take o' that�that useless cuss. By G�d ! it's 

 too bad." 

 The insurrectionary villain smote the rail with his great fist, and turned his eye on us to see what we thought of his sentiments, and I am afraid he read a general approbation of them in our eyes, for he again smote the deck, and was exceedingly profane. 

 "Hands up o' those who are going ashore at Townsville, he said. About 100 hands were raised. "Now, lads," he shouted, "What say about the basket ?" "Are we going to allow 'em to put you in it and tip you over the side like lumber ?" [Cries of " No ! no !" "or are ye going to insist on the chair ?"] 

 "The chair ! the chair ! or we go right on," was the general shout, and the spirited Northumbrian smiled approvingly, as he shouted "Right, lads ! don't forget it ! Show 'em we are not dogs, and that we know a thing or two." The big hamper wasn't used again on that trip. By 11 a.m. we had got all our passengers landed, and, as I before stated, were once more en route. 

 All that night and up till 10 next morning we held on to the south, the land always visible on the port side, when we again ran inshore and came to anchor in the Bay of Townsville. I can say little about this place either, as we were too far out to notice any of its features. It is, however, terribly hot, and the land rises very abruptly from the coast and is covered by a dense bush. Many bush fires seemed to be racing in the far interior, and a hot, smoky haze lay over the coast, and seemed to threaten us with death by suffocation if we stayed long in the vicinity. At this place we discharged a great quantity of merchandise, and also 100 pas- sengers, and on the evening of the following day we got up steam and resumed our journey. I might here remark that any part of the Queensland coast we had yet seen was very hilly, indeed there was nothing to be seen but hills except perhaps the hol- lows between them (this last is original) and the vast, never-ending forests that clothed the land were prolific cause of wonder to us. We made a brief stay at Bowen about midnight on that same night, and got "shut" of some more cargo and five of our fellow travellers, and finally on the 26th of the month we ran close into the land off the coast near 

 Port Mackay, and for two more days and nights nothing was heard but the crash of machinery and the yelling and clamour of our "happy Australians" as they continued to send ashore the valuable goods with which our mighty ship was loaded. 

 For several days we had been missing the genial face of our good surgeon on the ship, and, although no one wanted him professionally, many soon began to enquire for him, for he was a general favourite and much liked by all on board. When pressed, the captain said he was slightly indisposed, and could see no one for a day or two, but that if anything 

 ailed us there was a medical man in the saloon who would attend us. Nothing ailed us, however, and this answer of the captain set our curiosity at rest for the time. It was soon to be revived, and in a very startling way. 

 We left Port Mackay on the evening of the 28th, and after halting at Rockhampton on the following day and seeing another 150 of our comrades depart, we again got our anchor up and held on our way to Moreton Bay, the final goal of all our wanderings. Our doctor had not yet made his appearance on deck, and the new surgeon had taken his place in- stead. Grave rumours had also began to float about as to the cause of our good surgeon's illness, and it was not long ere the dread whisper "There is smallpox on board" was muttered gloomily on every side. What an appalling thing if this should be so after our long and happy voyage ; and how horrible should we be quarantined now when it is almost over and our haven of rest so near. We wandered gloomily about the decks, and had no heart to address each other, and still the picture of a desolate plague-struck ship riding in some lonely bay would rise before us, and we would see the ghastly burdens that were rolled into the sea each morning from her polluted deck. It was a sadden- ing termination to all our bright dreams of the past�sickening and horrible thought; and as we gazed into the clear waves under the vessel's counter we shuddered and shrank back in 

 horror. That clear wave might ere long conceal our cold forms, and yonder prowling shark might�ugh! why pursue the reflection? We retired that night very desolate and sad to dream horrible dreams and toss on troubled beds. Never since leaving home had I felt so depressed and sad, and when Connor rolled into his bed without bidding me good-night, as was his custom, I felt in my soul I was as good as gone. It was no comfort to me either when a short time thereafter I heard him praying industriously, and pounding his chest vigorously. I knew he was a great sinner, and felt no comfort in hearing him assert the fact so very often, and the last thing I remember con- sidering before I dropped off to sleep was whether I ought to rise and sympathise with him or get a boot and throw it at his head. Sleep negatived both projects, and I ceased for a time to debate the subject. 

 It was a glorious morning�the 3lst day of the month�when I again awoke, and by the quiet motion of the ship and the complete silence of the engines, I knew we were at anchor somewhere. Connor was still fast asleep, having, very probably, battered his chest till he had brought on insensi- bility, and as I had no desire to wake him to fresh misery, I rose and went on deck, leaving him to his rest. Already the decks were crowded with a silent, sad-faced throng, many of the women being 

 weeping, and an air of gloom was on every face. We were at anchor near the mouth of the Brisbane River, and from our gaff the yellow flag was streaming out on the breeze. No doubt at all about it now. Let the doctor's complaint be what it might, the ship was now in quarantine, and there was no help for us. My spirits now rose as if in defiance of common sense, and now that I knew the worst I seemed to be quite happy. It was the indecision that had been killing me, and I knew it. So, uttering a "glad whoop, I dived below and imparted the joyous tidings to Connor and my other chums. They listened to me quietly till I had finished, and then they rose up to a man and laid violent hands on me, and ten minutes later I crawled into my bunk, all the whoop gone out of me, and my mind properly attuned to the gravity of our situation. The Duke moved up the bay that same day and dropped her anchor off a lonely little island at its upper extremity, and in two days more we were all landed, and under 

 canvas in this�the Quarantine Station.
