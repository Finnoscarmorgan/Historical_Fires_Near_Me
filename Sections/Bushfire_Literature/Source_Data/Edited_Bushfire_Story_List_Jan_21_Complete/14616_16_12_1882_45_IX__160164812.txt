CHAPTER IX. 

 And is my heart so'stronK, 

 As for to leave me thus 

 Who hath loved thee so long ? 

 Say nay! Say nay! 

 Politian. E. A. l'OE. Care should be forgotten, And sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all, And life shall then be mine, for I will live For thee, and in thine eyes; 

 And 1 will kneel to thee, 

 And worship tlice, and call thee my beloved, My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,

 After supper, managed in the curious fashion common to country balls�i.e., the ladies feed first, and then languish alone, while the lords of creation satisfy their na tural cravings. 

 As Vivian rejoined Mrs. Gldcrtonand Mar garet, the latter enquired� 

 " Where is Lyndon ? Have vou seen him lately? We were to go home early." 

 " Your brother left a message for you. He felt anxious about the fire, and went home, or out to the Refuge, about an liour'ago, and begged me not to tell you till after supper. He asked me to drive home with you." 

 " Oh, no. I will stay with Mrs. Elderton to-night. Can you find room for me ?" 

 " Of course; only too glad." 

 " But, Miss Harleigh, you do not under stand. The fire has passed the boundary, and your brother has twenty men working at 

 it. He asked me to see that refreshments were sent out, and eaid you would know all about this. I think you ought to leave at once." 

 Margaret's anxiety swallowed up all her scruples and fears on any other count, so she was soon cloaked and seated in the wagon ette Vivian sat opposite; and here I am forcibly reminded of that capital old Irish song, " The Low-backcd Car:"� 

 "I'd sooner own that car. Sir, 

 With Peggy by iny siue, 

 Tlisn a coach and four, with gold galore, 

 With a lady for my bride. 

 For the lady would sit fornenst me 

 On a cushion made with taste; But Peggy would sit beside me, 

 With my arm around her waist!'.' 

 Pat's theory as to the strict observance of conventionalities on certain interesting occa sions is not often carried into practice. The crr'me de la crime are but mortal, after all; and the cushion "fomeust" the bridegroom, however tastefully organized, will generally, I fancy, be found unoccupied. 

 Margaret seemed to have lost all lie.- shy ness, and chatted away to Vivian without constraint on bush fires in general and this fire in particular. It was arranged by mutual agreement that as soon as Margaret and Jane could pack up what was necessary Vivian and James Bhould set off for the scene of action. 

 " You might come, too, and act the part of a virandi&re. But, 110; you must he tired� you looked so before supper." 

 " I am not tired. It is early yet; and here is Bulla." 

 The night was warm, and the moon slione down upon them, the-smoky air giving her 

 beams a curious effect. 

 Margaret looked lovely in her white opera cloak. Her eyes were glittering with the unusual excitement. She held her bouquet in her pretty ungloved hamls, on which sparkled many rings. 

 Vivian saw the sparkle, and put his hand on a pocket in his waistcoat, where reposed a little round case containing a ring of sap phires and diamonds. 

 " Why do you shiver? are you cold ?" 

 A o, said Margaret, I always shiver if I am excited or anxious, wc are going so slowly, What time is it?" 

 '' Half-past twelve!" 

 At last they drove through the gates, aud fouud Jane Dodding in a chair in the veran dah. She had been watching for Margaret, and now told thein that James had the spring-cart ready to take supper to the ex hausted beaters, that the fire was verv near the huts at the Refuge, The stockyards had been burnt, and many miles of fencing, and there was a note for theCaxitain. 

 Vivian handed it to Margaret after read ing it. 

 " Dear Vivian�We have, only just saved the huts, do not come on till James returns. I cannot leave Paringa without protection. Tell Margaret there are twenty men here, send food, ale, and coffee.�Yours, L.H." 

 Jane had prepared food and coffee for forty at leaBt, so with very little delay James started with his stores, they had been all standing out by the stables to see him off 

 " Jane, is Tina gone to bed ?" 

 "She is, Miss. She said you told her not to sit up, and we left supper in the master's room; and jilease, Miss, German John's wife is ill. 1 promised to go down and stop with ' her if there's nothing wanting." 

 Margaret gave permission, out not without a curious tremor at her heart. Tina asleep! 110 one else near them; all was " sultriness, and quietude, and slumber." If only she would keep up an outward calmness till safely within the citadel of her own apart 

 ment. 

 She turned slowly to Vivian. 

 " 1 will show you Lyndon's room. Come this way." 

 And eIic led him through a dimly-lighted passage to a large cool room, half library, half picture-gallery, lighted by high windows on one side only. Supper�consisting of cold chicken, tongue, and pastry�was on the table, and Marcaret begged Vivian to take 

 some refreshment. 

 " If you will. Indeed, yon look worn out. Let me give you a glaEB of wine." 

 " What is tliis ? Constantia?" 

 " N<�. 1 will go now: but do yon sncan to drive to the lire when James comes back?" 

 ?" It depends," said Vivian, his faco growing very white and stern, and he moved from the table and stood between "Margaret and the door. "It depends upon what you sayto me before you go away, if you tell me you wish me to go�that you care nothing for me�I will go back to Bulla, aud to Melbourne in the morning; but if you " 

 " Let me go. I cannot stay now." 

 "I will not!" and he shut the door, aud leant againBt it, his eyes fixed on hers. "It is my last chance. You must listen to me." 

 The girl looked at him with widely opened eyes, in which fear aud surprise were mingled. 

 " Tell me. What was it made you angry ? What did Lady Jones tell you I said." 

 Margaret came with her slow, gliding step, 

 and touched the door handle. 

 " Do you mean to say that in my own house�lny brother's house�you will keep me here, just because you are stronger than! am ? And you are a gentleman. There is not a man on the run who would be such a 

 coward. Let me go." , 

 She spoke in a low, intense voice. He ' watched her with a great love and sorrow in bis eyes. 

 " 1 do mean that I will not let you go. My patience has come to an end, and my hope� oh, my darling, inutt it die?" 

 He had left the door, and followed her as she turned away. 

 "How can you torture me so, Margaret; if I must go, let ine kiss you once." 

 She turned in utter astonishment at his 

 audacity, and he saw tears in her eyes. In a 

 seccnd his arms were round her. 

 " Why, Margaret, my darling ; did lmakc you cry. Forgive me. You snail never fear me again. Of course you can go wh.en you like; but wait one moment. You will not send me away now. Can you love me ? Look up. Let me see your sweet eyes?" 

 She looked up at hiin, but her heart throbbed so quickly she could not speak. 

 " I see you are mine. You cannot escape now. Your eyes speak, ^hey say you are 

 mine." 

 She drew herself from his arms. Her breath carnc quick and short. 

 " Oh, wait�wait�I cannot; it is for all our lives; I am afraid." 

 She shivered; but his arm was round her again, and he drew her to a low-cushioned divan. 

 " ait there�you look so white�on, Mar garet, did I frighten you ?" 

 He stood looking down at her (as slie leant hack among the cushions) and taking in the picture with eager eyes, f'om the lovely pale face, with drooped eyelids, hiding the shining brown eyes which could not meet his, the slender fonn still clad in the cloudy, glisten ing, evening dress, hands tightly clasped� down to the pretty feet, which were clearly visible. 

 "From forehead down to foot, perfect again, from foot to forehead exquisitely turned." 

 "I must go now," and she wont<3 have risen but Vivian knelt down beside her. 

 " Not yet. Look here, Margaret, I have carried this about with me ever since I began to hope," and be drew out the case containing the sapphire ring, "take off these other rings, and let me put this on." 

 To his surprise, her face changed� 

 " No, no, not yet�I it is so late." She stood nj:. 

 Vivian rose to his feet. 

 "Go! before you have said a woid tome! How can I let you? Well, kiss ine once more." And he drew her slight figure to him. 

 Hid the sweet mouth turn towards his? flow pale grew her shell-pink cheeks! How heavily her light form leaned against his eager arms ! Was it weariness? or had 

 she 

 " Well nigli swooned in the deep-drawn bliss 

 Of that first long, sweet, slow, stolen kiss." 

 Ah, Margaret! AVliat of the fortress ? the outposts surrendered long ago, and now the ramparts are scaled, and Eros stands, torch in hand, ready to take possession of the treasure house. 

 " And now you are rfty owu. Arc you, Margaret ?" 

 " A es," the girl's voice trembled, " And ycu love me at last?" 

 " Yes. 

 " Look up, my darling. How you shiver! Now you will wear my ring?" 

 But 1 fancy the brave captain's hand trem bled a little as he put the sparkling circlet on the white finger she held out. 

 " Are you sleepy, my darling?" 

 " No, only a little tired and cold." 

 He made her take some wine, and brought i 

 over her sealskin coat. 

 " If you are not sleepy, why not sit here with me till Harleigh comes ?" 

 " No, indeed; I must go. Won't you take some supiier? and your room is next this," 

 " AVhy must you go ? Is it because Mrs. | Grundy will not approve ? She can't have much to say to us here!" 

 But he saw she would not stay, and accom panied her through the long passages to the 

 door of her room. 

 " You are not sorry that I acted up* to the old motto? I nearly despaired once or- twice! Good night, my darling!" 

 " l ove is come with a sung and a smile 1 Welcome, Love, with a smile and a song. Love can stay but a little while. 

 W hy cannot lie stay ? They call him away. Ye do him wrong! Ye do him wrong 1 Love will stay for a whole life long! 

 Harold, Act 1, Sc. ii.

 The author begs to explain the words over heard by Lady Jones. 

 VIhen Captain Viviau said, "Will the arrangement suit Mrs. Harleigh?" lie referred to an invitation Lyndon had just given him to stay that night at ElmhurBt. 

 And when Lyndon said, "If you will arrange that to-morrow morning it will be a relief to my mind ?" lie referred to a promise Captain Vivian had made to give a berth in the OrpheuB to a young man in whom Lyndon 

 was interested. 

 I may mention before taking leave that the next day, during a ride to the Refuge, all this and more was explained. 

 In the course of a long evening talk in the moonlit verandah, Lyndon having judiciously effaced himself, Meg lifts her head from her lover's shoulder and says, "And if your motto had been 'Nunc aut Nunquani,' would you have acted up to it ?"
