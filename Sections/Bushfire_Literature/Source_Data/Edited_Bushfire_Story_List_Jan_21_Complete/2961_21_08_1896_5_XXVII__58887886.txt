CHAPTER XXVII. "She only knew the birth and death Of days when each that died, Was still at morn a hope, at night A hope unsatisfied.  The dark trees shivered to behold Another day begin. She, being hopeless, did not weep As the grey dawn came in." �Symons.  Not for nearly a year after Beatrice went up to the Goulburn Valley was the railway thither opened, so her journey was by train to Seymour �thence by coach to Shepparton. As she drove through the rather mon- otonous scenery (the chief beauty of which was that of the lofty and splendid red-gums, which reared their kingly heads among the lighter timber of box and scrub), the question presented itself to her, as it has to many others before and since, why should the district be called the Goulburn Valley ; why not, rather, the Goulburn Plains? This question became insistent as the only considerable rising ground�the Tallarook Ranges�faded from sight. At Shepparton�then a very small town- ship�she was met by the farmer and his wife, and was driven by them �first through the dusty town�and then past Mooroopna, through very level and pro- saic country, well-cleared of timber (which had been of a slight and scanty nature), and thoroughly under cultiva- tion. The rich chocolate surface soil, with its clay bottom, suited wheat, Mr Lawson told Beatrice, and wheat, con- sequently, was then the staple product of the district, vine-growing being hardly in its earliest infancy at that date. Mr Lawson was himself a wheat- grower, though, in former times, his station had been part of a station car- rying sheep. He talked volubly of his crops as they drove along�of his har- vesting (which was now over), and the couple of acres he had planted out with young and promising vines. Wearily she submitted to the fate she saw loom- ing large before her�that of patient lis- tening to eternal conversation about weather and crops. As well about that as about anything else, she told herself, and roused up to a simulated interest in the enthralling subject of "rust" which, about that time was a veritable scourge in the district. When----------- was reached it proved to be a very pretty homestead. The house was rambling and more pic- turesque than substantial. Away from it on one side sloped a beautiful fruit garden, with trellised and vine-covered walk.s Under shady fig-trees were gar- den seats, and she had but to stretch out her hand out of her bedroom window to gather the most luscious peaches from a tree, whose over-weighted boughs hung within easy reach. All around the house were gentle rises, thickly timbered, which gave a slight variety to the fertile, but rather mono- tonous scenery. The proud Goulburn curved glitteringly in the distance, and along the banks grew the noble and giant-like red gums, which, even though so far away, stood boldly marked against the horizon. After the cooler climate of the Kos- ciusko country, the extreme, dry heat seemed to Beatrice intense, but � like most new chums�she bore it well. Yet, as day after day passed, she grew thin- ner, and her dusky cheeks became more pale. After all, she decided, Nellie was wise to choose a busy life. She is com- pelled to take an interest in all around her; whereas, there is nothing here to take me out of my wretched self. If only I had been up here in the old free- booting times, of which these people tell me, I might have found it easier to en- dure the shut-up life. How.incredible it seems when one hears the tales of Cap- tain Melville and "Black Douglas," that this peaceful, agricultural district was ever the scene of maraudery and violence. I think it must be a"cast-back" to some more turbulent and lawless age; for certainly this peaceful environment chafes me. And I feel as if the dark days of lawless deeds would have been far more congenial ! Heigho! These reflections occurred after an outing the Lawsons had treated her to, in the shape of a drive to a secluded spot on the banks of the Goulburn, between Mooroopna and Tatura. Here were to be seen a few old posts, remnants of a sta- tion-homestead, but this poor attempt of the new country at imitation of Eng- land's -----�glory�"ruins," was not the attraction at Juniss' Bend. Rather was 

 it the fact that here the once notorious freebooter, Captain Melville, had had a receptacle for stolen horses. These, in the palmy days of Bendigo, had been driven backwards and forwards be- tween that place and the Ovens Rush, and sold in whichever market seemed the least risky, and promised the greater profit. Not only by the "Captain" had this secluded spot been used for the purpose of hiding stolen property, but also by "Black Douglas," and many and blood-curdling were the stories repeated to Beatrice by the Lawsons of the lawless robber bands, which had kept the country-side in terror. "Ah, things are much better now," the farmer would add, "the people who talk so much of these Kellys should have lived then up here." The placid life, broken only by flood or fire, and not often by that, or, so far, to any serious extent, was all the quiet, plodding farmer's heart could wish; but to Beatrice, the mode of their life seemed vegetating, not living. The days were weary enough�the hot, sunny, monotonous days-�but the nights were worse. Ever since the river accident she had been more or less a victim to insomnia; and now its hold on her increased. When, utterly exhausted by hours of feverish tossing, she fell asleep, it was to see Bernard's face, haggard, drawn, as it was when she bade him fare- well. . . or Frank Harcourt's face, now shining out of the deepening dark- ness, white, remorseful, wretched, as it was just before that awful railway ac- cident, or looming ghost-like out of the grey London fog, or staring down at her with hate, as when she saw it last. Nellie's phantom came but seldom, and, always as a blessing, not as a re- proach. And so, ill, wretched, nervous, over- strung , she lived through the hot January and February, and just as March set in, came the excitement, which she had longed for as a possible cure. The last day of February was of such a character that she could no longer complain of the uneventfulness of life. Towards the middle of it (it was a very hot day) there came, suddenly borne on the wind, a scorching smell. The children, in the midst of their lessons, stopped and looked at each other. "Bush fire!" said Flo, learnedly. "Not much of one." said Lizzie, "with equally sapient air." "We'll go and ask your mother about it," said Beatrice. Ever moment the smell was becoming stronger. They ran across the court- yard, which separated the schoolroom from the rest of the wooden house. Mrs Lawson, heated and anxious, stood in the kitchen, in consultation with the maid-servant. The air all round was thick with smoke; and the sky was a dull and coppery red. "The worst of it is," said Mrs Lawson. addressing Beatrice, "that John and the men are over at Kirk's�the fire is straight between their place and ours; so he simply can't get back here to help us. My word,what a state of mind he'll be in!" "Are we in any danger?" asked Bea- trice. "Plenty" was the laconic answer. As she spoke, Mrs Lawson divested herself of her dress, put on a thick under-skirt, and tied a woollen hood round her head. "No time to lose," she hurriedly ex- plained, " we are safe for the present, Miss Hamilton; but the ricks will go, as sure as fate, and if the farm buildings and the house go too, as I bet they will, Lawson's a ruined man. He's suffered enough from flood�fire will about finish him off." "What can I do to help ?" "Co into the house and make oatmeal water�the children will show you how. The men from Ford's will be over as soon as they see what's up: and they will help beat off; but they'll want drinks, for the work's no joke, I can tell you. Now, Mary Ann, come on," and armed with boughs, the stout servant and the farmer's wife set out. "They mean to beat off on the north side," said Flo, "that is the very side the fire is coming from, and the only place where the grass hasn't been burnt off. "Father and Pat meant to burn off to-morrow," chimed in Lizzie. "Ah, there are Ford's men at the pad- dock gate," called Flo, exultantly. "We're all right now, for they'll help beat off!" And so, through the hot morn- ing hours they did, but in vain, so far as the farm-build- ings, the ricks, the expensive agrl- cultural implements were concerned; and, by three o'clock, the house itself was threatened. Long before this time Beatrice was in active service. The children and she filled buckets, dippers, billies, every vessel procurable with water from the tanks. The servant, mounted on a ladder, handed them to Mrs Lawson, who, perched on the roof, poured water all around. The flames had not yet reached the dwelling, but the smoke was blinding and choking, and sparks flew all around. Suddenly Mrs Lawson flagged. "I can't do any more," she said, faintly, "go and call the men. It's no use trying to save the stock now; they must come and help here." Beatrice flew to the blazing out-build- ings; to her horror, when she reached them, she found that one man lay sense- less on the ground, while the other show- ed such signs of deep exhaustion that it was evident he would be of little further aid. With Beatrice's help the fainting man was dragged up to the house. Both of them were rather recently ar- rived Irish laborers, and their one year of Australian life had not given them great insight into bush fire manage- ment. Apart from that, their apparently powerful frames had not the wiry vigor pertaining to the seasoned bush- man. The fainting man soon revived, but after a hasty consultation with his mate, he counselled flight. In fact, it was now only too evident that any hope of escape from death lay that way; for the house was alight in several places, and the tanks were empty. "The wind will favor us; we'll make for the river," decided Mrs Lawson. "Faix, ye'll never win there," said Patrick O'Shea, despondently. "It'ull be as far as the water-hole we'll get," put in Mick Shane. "Come, little ones, that's bare a quarter mile." He snatched up Flo; Mick seized Lizzie, and with a last look of misery and farewell at her burning home�the grave of much wasted labor and fruit- less hope and energy�poor Mrs Lawson followed them, Beatrice and the servant bringing up the rear. The men tore fast through the blinding smoke; soon they were lost sight of, but all knew the way to the water-hole. On, on they hurried, their heads and shoulders wrapper in hastily-torn half blankets, to protect them from the showering sparks. Mr Lawson was not a very well-to-do farmer, and his land was not as well cleared as most in the neighborhood, therefore, most of their road lay through wooded stretches. The wind, at the back of them, tore now with increased and frightful velocity, and the flames leapt from tree-top to tree-top (often for distances such as 150 yards), in lurid, wreathing magnificence. The burning grass tangled their feet, and they often stumbled and half fell. Half-way to the water-hole they caught up to the men. Plethoric Mick had again fallen fainting to the ground, and Flo, a picture of wild and helpless terror, stood beside him. Their calls brought back Patrick, who, incon- tinently handed Lizzle to Mary Anne. "Yees better hould on to her," he said, "and I'll lug Mick along till he comes to." So Beatrice and Mary Anne each took one child, while Mrs Lawson and Patrick dragged Mick along. The flames leaped and caught at the dangling little legs of the carried chil- dren; caught, too, at the hands that held them, but, at last, oh God be praised! �at last the water-hole was reached! The cool water spread before them; I 

 but, alas, it was fringed with tall and burning timber. As far as they dared, for the hole had treacherous depths, varying from one to six feet, they waded in, scooping up soft mud to cover and cool their burnt feet and scorched arms. "God be praised !" again cried Mrs Lawson, and pressed her little ones to her heart. What booted the loss of pro- perty? Had she not her darlings safe? If only, also, their father were alive�un- hurt . And. . . . as the words of praise and prayer fell from her scorched lips, there came a crash, sudden, appalling, deafen- ing. A fallen tree�oh God! �a fallen, burn- ing tree, crashing with Titanic splen- dour and glory of demoniac flame into the very centre of that fought-for refuge. And, where the mother had clasped her children, and thanked God for the gift of their precious lives, lay only a smouldering, giant red gum trunk . . . and pressed beneath into the waterhole, three crushed bodies no longer suffering no longer in pain or fear.
