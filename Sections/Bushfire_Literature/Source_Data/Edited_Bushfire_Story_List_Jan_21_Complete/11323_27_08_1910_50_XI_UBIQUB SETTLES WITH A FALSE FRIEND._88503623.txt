 CHAPTER XI.-UBIQUB SETTLES WITH A FALSE FRIEND. 

 Irving Steele eat in one of the boxes of Hot Majesty's Theatre; a friend of hi6� from the Customs department � by his side. The curtain had just descended on the ftret act of a prominent social problem play. The two men were joined by a few mends from the dress circle, who wished to have a smoke and a chat between, the iott. 'Rather a rolten sort of play,' remarked one. 

 'I don't know. Seems to cany some hidden meaning,' returned another. Here Steele's friend interjected. '.My opinion is that the man received some pro vocation for his subsequent behaviour. What do you think?' he said, addressing Steolc. The play In question 'centred around a man, wqo, previous to his great misfortune waB a happy father, and a man who held a certain social position. The misfortune referred to was a false friend who seduced Ihe affections of the man's wife, thus break ing up the home and turning the betrayed husband Into ft. pronounoed cynic, whose 

 nano. is against every in&u �? Steele, thus referred to, gave his friends hifl opinion, 'My candid opinion is that the man lacked stability of character. Why Should the man make his position worse by futile worry? If the woman proved her BeW worthless, then, I take it, he was welt rid of her.' 'But you always were coM-blooded Steele,' returned his friend. 'Cold-Wooded or no,' replied Steele. 'You must admit thai my argument hears d logical view of the question.' 'Logic ba hanged!' replied his friend. 'If a man loves a ?woman � loves her, you w&deretand� it is fani-oasible for him to .wipe hor from' his life as if she had never feisted. She is the mother of his children and, until the debacle occurred, was a part �t hia being.' 'Hear, hear!' chorused the others. 'Eteole has never loved; hence his cold blooded logic.' Perhaps It's because I have loved that 1 possess such opinions,' returned Steele, ' 'TIs batter to hava loved and lost &c,' jrijjnicked.his friend. 

 uuite so, II tne result is to be similar to the play.' returned Steele. 'The cumin is going up now. I'll see you after the show.' Hlfl friends left the box, and Steele gava hltncelf up to the complexities of the p^ay fn progress. Steele awaited liie friends after the play and accompanied them to supper. 't was thinking of your outlaw, Steele, frhile the play, waa in progress,' remarked 'Oh! and why?' I can't tell exactly, but I was thinking that, perhaps, there we* a similar episode p. hi� life that oaused him to go astray.' wDd you know of any euch incident ?'' en 3 red another. o Steele this subject was not a very i table one. He saw the outfa-fcj iu the k again, heard his impassioned cry it gainst the injustice of being condemned on Circumstantial evidence, neard his vow of fraigeonoe against himself.' Consequently his answer touuded somewhat bitter to his fc&rers. I certainly know of such an incident, as you term It,' he replied, coldly, 'though, personally, I think such incidents are bet tel resting in oblivion.' 'Oh don't get nasty about it!' another interjected. 'Let's hear the story. Any thing to dispel the gloom of that sordid play?' j Steele evidently could not avoid the sub jsdli without giving offence to his friends. |-&, giving vpnt to a Bigh of resignation he Ibmmenced Us tale. 

 I was engaged by Mr. Geoffry Thureton about two years since to enquire auto a fiasfl of petty larceny.' 'Thureton of the Change?' enquired' his friejbd 'The same; and he informed me that of late be had miescd various small sums, in addition to numerous stamps. He explained lie did not mind the loss� that was trivial; UQt ho did not care to have suspicion cast upon others in the office. Hence his en gagement of myself.' And you flx'ed upon this Ubique?' 'Bettet -wtit, and near me out, returned gteele, with a touch of hauteur. 'My en Quiriea in this direction led me to discover that the acoountg had been cooked. The tooks were falsified to the extent of sovera] thousand*. On comparing the handwrit ing of every jjerson In the office, I came to the conclusion that this Ubique, as he now tenns himself -was the culprit.' ?' course ihe denied it?' remarked his 'yes. IJiad the whole staff carpeted in lit, Thunton's office. What made things I'toK blacker against the suspected man was that he was the last person to be seen handling the accounts. Then, again, a it&mn bearing the perforation of the firm .. Was found upon a_n envelope addressed to the lady typist with whom he was keeping company.' 'Why did she submit the letter for in speotlbnf' enquired his friend. ^There's no telling woman's ways,' re turned Steele, cynically. 'I believe -hat j-n the flnjt sign of trouble she transferred bit, affections to the second clerk, who himself had long been a rival of the eus P�ctfji man.' ? 'Was he convicted on that flimsy evi dfflxcef' ' ?Not exactly. You see, he had been batting heavily and living above his iri fe. He explained that he had won a e cum of money . over the Melbourne . But, of course, he could -not produce bookmaker'; so his fate was certain. ? 'Did Thurston oJFer bim a -way out?' 'Yes! He eaid he would only discharge tfyj man if he made full restitution of the stolen cash.' 'And what was his reply?' 'Hie reply -was to savagely attack his rival, ana Aalf-stranirie him 1-rfore he Bpuld be pulled off. Snouted out some rot about hia rival fixing it on him for spite. 'Apvp-ayf, he -got two' years, in spite or his wantage. But ft was pretty bard, if his tale was true.'' '?????? Steqle Uughed jpitnTz. 

 'True. Every :jian in prison today will assert his complete imio&snse, if lie wore asked.' 'And he threatened you did Jie.not?' '7.1c certainly mado some ruiark about making me sorry fcr ibe part I played. But, oi course, I took no hoed of tuch ruv Jngs.' 'And has he oaT^d you trouble?*' en quired his friend maliciously. Steele rose from the table, and, paying the bill, prepared to depart. 'I think that is best known to myself!' he exclaimed, coldly. 'Touched him on the raw that time,' said the other, as he hailed a cab. , ? ? . -\\ Steele was lounging at his ease in the smokeroom of the Australia. Ooffee stood at his hand. He lay back in his chair i 

 ivjlh a Keen sense oi tne luxuriousness oi ] his surroundings, -while a Turkish cigarette! between his lips caused a. filmy vapor to ascend heavenward. 'This seems too good to last,' he mur mured. 'I suppose that d ? d outlaw! will be causing some fresh trouble pretty! eoon: and then it will entail me following j him all over the wildest parts of the bush. D ? n him!' he added As if in answer to his multerings, the attendant crossed to. where he sat. 'Letter for you, sir,' he exclaimed, Steele took the letter mechanically. 'Wonder who this is from?' he murmured. His face assumed a worried expression as lie perused it. A glance at the following did not go to improve his temper: � 'Dear sir � I know that you have had a great deal of experience with the 'gentle man' who is causing me so much, trouble � 

 nameiy, sne person wlio terms himself 'Ubique.' This sooundrel has taken to patrolling the district with a email but powerful motor car, He is one of these �ets of society called by the ignorant socialists j talks about the earth being the Lord's and the fulness thereof. Rank heresy, I call ;t. He has already caused me considerable inconvenience and expense. Now he 6peaks of levying a toll upon me. Says that as I monopolise the land, I must be compelled to pay for it. I want you to coma .here and deal with him. I will reimburse you at your own figure. Come at once, and relieve the anxiety of 'ifours truly, 'PETER DAWLISH. 'Owner of Kanamba Station, 'Kartamha XTSW.' 

 Steele's eyes seamed to narrow to pin points as he placed the letter in his pocket book. 'What a hide the fellow has to be sure!' le growled. 'But we shall see. Perhaps lie will not be so successful with his motor car as he was with his boat, he added, as he prepared himself for immediate de parture Steele alighted at the little wayside sta tion of Kanamba and enquired of the sta tion's one solitary official� 'Had anyone notified him that a conveyance was to cali for a passenger for the station?' The said official scratched his head. He believed that someone had mentioned something about cabling with a buggy, but couldn't sav for ep.rr.nin whpn. 

 Cursing the man's stupidity, Steele lit us pipe, and, sitting on his bag. prepared o pass the time in reflection of the case he had been colled upon to unravel. 'Peter Dawlish,' he mused. 'Dawlish: I ve certainly heard that name somewhere.' He resumed his pipe, endeavoring to re call his fleeting memory in a cloud of smoke. He startled, the official, who had been watohing him intently, by a loud ex clamation of 1 have it!' 'Beg pardon, sir,' the official exclaimed. Oh, $9 to the devil!' returned Steele, angrily, ahnoyed at having his thoughts in truded upon. 'Yes, sir,' replied tlie official, sarcasti tally. ? Any message?' Steele resumed his smoking and allowed 118 thmiorVltu full annna 'f-dn,, TV, ,.,1:^1, 

 �yes, that was it. Dawlish was the man whom Ubique had accused of putting th.-; defalcations at Mr. Thurston's office on to his� Ubiquo's� shoulders. 'That clears the atmosphere somewhat,' muttered Steele reflectively. So this Dawlfeh was iu for a. bad time, providing it was the same person. Ubique was not a man to forget old scores. If it occupied the better part of a lifetime he would be certain- to eoore at the finish. '�es,' mused the detective; 'I wouldn't c&re to be in Mr. Dawlish'* shoes.' As if in answer to hh soliloquy, a buggy drove up to the station in a oloud of dust; a hard-bitten, sunburnt maa descended rom the vehicle, and, after cursing the leat, flies, and everything -in -particular for the space of five iuiiiutes or *o, sirod-! up ? to where the detective ? sat, -watching the amusing scene, and gruffly enquired 'If he wan a party name ol Mr. Steele?' 'les, why didn't you arrive to meet th� tram?' demanded Steele, angrily, 'Look here, boss,' 'replied .-the man, 'did rou ever drive two, hair-bred d � ^-bruin.:- bias with a harness tied wU;h- string?.' The detective, laughed at the nian's tone of injured innocence. 'O&n'.t nay that I've had that delightful experience.' , 'Thought not; else you wouldn't have flsked a silly question like you did,' grow led the man. 'Jump in,' he added; J Steele olimbed into the crazy vehicle. Is everything in as bad repair on this sta tion ?' he enquired. -'.-?... 'Just about. Dawliuh is as rich ag that Greek chap� Oreeses, isn't it?'' he enquired; OrasBus,' correoted Steele. ? . - 'Well, he's as rich ee lim, and he's aa ? n stingy as a miser. He'd make his dinner service outer kerosene tins . if his T,vife 'ud let, him. Wife!1' he growled. 'Reckon she's more of a slave.' ? , ?' 'Surely, with all his. wealth , ge -16esnlt force his wife to work?' ;. ? -'.--. 'Not exactly.' ???-,? - .'.'? 'What do yon mean, then?' ? , 'Well, the poor lady hr$ to;dre�s -lierself m clothes that would jnake the charms of a black gin look more ugly than ever,*' 'I wonder j'ou stay on,, tfcen,'-' replied Steele. 'I suppose that he Is *s miserly ] with you as the rest?' ? . I ''Not much!'-' ?grinnea\\ the man. 'ij punohed his head once for -insulting ;^iiiY wife in my hearing, aiid How &-�# pretty] 

 ^%heh -^ni ariB r$:Tkify wdl ypw pwtf, ?a?SP3^i;^-'rt�^v'if^^M!�X'! way. I'd, poison him.' ' '- , '? . '4-o they ever have any visitors?' . , ''Well, I've been on ^his blamed station, two years, and the only visitor I've seen was- the iadyjs mother, and -she stayed two days, after .having quarrelled with her son in-law best part of the time.' �nji at the thoughts of thut delightful experience the man was nearly choked with laughter. 'Here wt arei' yelled the coachman, pulling up at the slip rails. ''You can walk over to the house from here; I'm driv ing round to the stables.' A tall, dour-faced man met Steele as he ascendeo. the steps of Kanamba homestead. 'Mr. Steele, I assume?' he exclaimed in 

 a cold voice. 'Yes. Is there any shower bath handy? I can hear your story after. I'm nearly choked with dust.' ' 'You will find it at the back there,' in dicating it with a lean hand. 'My wife will prepare some refreshment for you after/' Steele made for the bathroom; anything to be rid 'of that awful dust. He was ; mentally summing his host up as .he splashed the water over himself in delight ful abandon. 'Seems an unhappy sort of chap,' ho mused. 'Looks as if the coachman was right.' l�e - changed his blue serge for a white j drill, and, placing his bag in the hall,^ en tered the reception room. His host came forward. 'My wife�Mr. Steelo.' He introduced the pair with as much warmth as one would expect from a ' stone image. Steele was prepared to find a broken-Epirited woman, but what he did . see, as he shook hands, gave him a mental shock. The lady before him was one of. those nervous wrecks, a young-old woman, j Her eyes were the eyes of a woman at her I best � the age of thirtyj but they had a fur- : tive scared look about them, as if afraid of doing something that blame would at tach to. Her hair, which at her age, should have been prolifio, was scanty and frey. The clothing she wore was a non escript confection that one would expect to see nowhere outside of a fancy dreS3 hall, and ewn at. f.Vint. it. -nrmilri havfi been 

 more respectable. The tout ensemble gave Steelo a shock, and he felt a loathing for the man, who, to acquire money, con demned his wife to this pitiably humiliating spectacle. ''Glad to meet you,' the lady exclaimed, in a faraway- tone. She promptly subsided alter this greeting, as if conscious of her position In the house. Dawlish offered the detective ft cigar, which, being of a cheap brand, Steele refused. 

 'I need not explain how worried I am by this Ubique's scoundrelly letter,' he ex claimed. 'I would like you to peruse it,'4 '.Not necessary; I've made myself ac quainted with your copy.' 'This scoundrel,' continued Diwlish, 'had the audacity to forge my name to a cheque yesterday � a cool hundred pounds lost to me!' he almost shrieked. 'How did you first discover this?' en quired Steelo. He rang me up on the telephone � we have one Here to the town � and had the impudence to inform me of what he had accomplished, and added that was for ex penses incurred, but that he would require inuoh more and he would let me know shortly when he would require the balance.' And. he trembled at the thought of his lost hundred. 'Pardon me asking,' said Steele, 'but, were you not in the employ of Mr. Geoflry' Thurston. of Sydney, some few years ago '!'' The other jaw dropped; he stared at Steele as# if he had seen a ghost, but re gained his composure at length. 'You startled me somewhat,' he ex plained. 'Yes, I was with Mr. Thurston for some three years.' 'And it was there you saved sufficient money to take up land?' 'Yes. But what the devil are you driv ing at?' he almost screamed. 

 Ubique really is?' 'I'm sure I don't know, and, what's more, don't care.' Steele leaned over to whisper a name into the ear of Dawlish. That gentleman's facs assumed a ghastly hue. He gazed furtively around, and then, with a gtertled crys fell, fainting to the floor. ~ Mrs. Dawlish had just left her husband's side. He had been very weak since the revelation of the outlaw's name by Steele. He had been seized with on old attack of apoplexy, and now slowly recovering from that malignant complaint. He wife wan dered far frfijn the station, hardly con fccious of the fact that she was farther from her home than she ever had been for years. But to-night her mind was disturbed by strange fancies. The consciousness of her egregious mistake in linking her life with a man whose god was wealth, seemed to repeat itself to her wandering brain with relentless force. Had not her punishment been great? She had failed her lover in his hour of need and had given herself to his rival, thus add ing insult to injury. But her ctime� if crime it was� was palliated, in her mind, by the fact that Tt Was not io much fickleness of mind as the intense longing for a home. All girls aro ike that, slie thought. They long for a home of their own, away from greldy rela tives, away from grasping landladies� and they, oontfaot a marriage of convenience. But they suffer for it after. Of that she was certain; her own life for instance. The poorest woman in a small 'humpy' was a queen to her� her, the victim of greed! She threw herself down at the foot' or a_ tree and burst into, a flood of heartre lieving tears. . . 'Would that I were dead!' she sobbed in anguish. 'Plenty of time for that!' exclaimed. a voice that almost sent her into an attack of hysteria. Gazing tearfully upward she encountered the stern gaze of a well-remembered face Staring fiercely into her own. It almost froze the utterance that rose mechanically to lier startled lips. 'You! Ed ? ' .. Ubique� for it was that famous outlaw � strode quickly forward;' his hand was placed across her mouth, strangling . the namo she wag about to utter. 'Not that name here!' he sternly com manded. 'You above all, should be the last. to make use -of it.- And ? ' But, seeing the havoc wrought in her oriee' beautiful face by sorrow, he relented, and the sarcastic remark with which he was about to wither the trembling woman re mained etrangled at its birth.' 'Great Heavens, Nell!' he exclaimed. 'What ,-on *arth has wrought this change in yoii ?!',-??:;? . ' ' ? ? The ^'--man rdrew near to him, placing her;;h�ud 'upon his shoulders.. --She burse lhl6 a 'flood of tears, 'I have been greatljj punished,' she sobbed. 

 'Ifor thy deefertibri of ypu. r inarrieS l)fiWUsh.r tCs'jgpd is iiibttey, atodl inigb never Mye' existed for all the: ^part'I form in 'his life/' ; -? -\\ . - Ubique bit his lip with suppressed furjr. 'The despicable dogl' he hissed: 'B Godi I have a good mind to shoot him!' The womun clung convulsively .upon hia arm at this latter statement. 'Don't take any notice of him; he is not worth it; and, alter all, it is my place to stay by him� he js my husband!' 'He is- more � he is my life's enemy!' exclaimed the outlaw, hoarsely. 'This man has ruined my life as well as yours. 'Tis he who has driven me to this outlaw's life; for,, doubtless, you are aware of my identity with the bushranger, Ubique?' 'I suspected something of the kind,' the woman replied. 'But it it too late to give up the life?' 'Not too late, hut too soon. I have an account to settle with your husbaud. After that � who knows?' The woman again clung to him. 'You would not murder him?' she entreated. Ubique gently detached her clinging hands. 'I would not take his life.' he laughed. 'But I will take something, to him, infinitely more precious � his money.' 'Is it too late to leave him?' (This to the woman). 'I must stay with him; it is my fate.' 'But I can got you placed with a good family in Sydney. Ubique replied. ' 1'ou would be much better off, even as a ser vant,' he added. 'It is too late. Hark! I can hear some thing moving. I must be going; they will miss me.. And now, Good-bye! I cannoi ask you to forgive, me; my deception is too great!' Ubiquo raised her hands to his lips. 'If* your deception was great,' he said, sorrow fully, 'your punishment is greater. Fare well I may yet accomplish a sciieme lor your deliverment. For the present, au re voir.' And a moment after she sped away leaving the outlaw bent low with his bitter thoughts. Steele sat by the bedside of Dawlish, who had just finished his scanty repast. He had been laboring under some vague sense of uneasiness ever since the mail had ar rived. At length he- could endure the suspense 

 iiu iuiiger. .milling iw oteeitr, uv jaciiiucvi a letter to that worthy to peruse. This was a letter from Ubique, and the contents ran as follow: � To Peter Dawlish, thief, perjurer, miser breaker of his wife's heart, owner of Kanamba Station, and dirty ekunk in general.� Take notice that, unless �5,000 in gold (not notes) is placed by the last post of No. 2 paddock (the post painted white) by the_day after to-morrow at twelve of the clock, your sheds will be fired and your outbuildings blown down. You are to pay for my three years' misery and degradation and at five thousand it is very cheap in deed. I would have made it three times the amount, only in consideration of your heart-broken wire, I have forgone my in tended reveDge. You dog! I know mouey is more to you than wife, honor� aye, even life itself! Otherwise I could thrash your miserable soul out of its sordid hide. Now, 

 tai^e notice � ana T-ne iourcn-rai/e aetectivo staying with you can prove my statement �I never fail to carry out a promise cr a threat. If the money is not there at time stated, then the buildings will suffer and still the five thousand will be insisted upon. So digest what 1 have written and thank Heaven I have not. handled you personally. 'E. K. (now Ubique).' Steelq put the letter down with a sigh. 'He'll carry out his word, too� unlesg -I can manage to fool. him, which is almost impossible.' Peter Dawlish moaned and wrung his hands in despair. 'Arrest him, Steele,' he shrieked, 'and vou shall have golden pounds. Oh, dear! It took me years of planning to raise hall that sum.' He seized the detective's arm in a con vulsive grip. 'Arrest him, Steele,' he dred.' Steele shook off the grip with a snort shrieked, 'and you shall have two hun 

 endeavor to arrest him without any incen tive of money,' he returned coldly. 'Well, do as you like. I shall get up at once and assist you.' And, in spite of protests from his wife and Steele, he dressed and busied himself with, the pre parations for the outlaw's capture. Punctually at the hour appointed for the placing of the money at the white post afore-mentioned, Steele and several of the station hands were waiting near by. ready to .pounce out upon the outlaw when he arrived. ? The appointed hour arrived and passed; still no sign of the messenger, liiey were getting deoidedly impatient, Dawlish even going so iar as to laugh in his glee at his supposed escape. Kteele crossed, over to dig up the dummy packet buried by the white post. Several of the men assisted him.' A moment later Steele and two of the men gave vent to loud curses. To SteadV themselves they had laid hold of the fencing wire. A. shook of electricity passed through their frames and almost 

 iimuicaueousiy a ioua roar shook -cue eartn. forgetting their pain in the new incident they gazed toward the place from whence the report emanated. Peter Dawlish groaned with dismay. His five outbuild ings had been blown up simultaneously. The buildings had 'been undermined and a length of wire joined to the fence com pleted the circuit. It was useless to look 'or the outlaw; the fencing ran for miles -ack, .and a' current -could 'be transmitted the whole distance. They marched dispiritedly back to the louse. Another sensation awaited them. Mrs. Dawlish had been rung up on the telephone,' and a voicg informed her that the cash would have to be aent to Dingo Flat in two days'. time. And so it was a sad party that sat at dinner -that night. Ubique was hidden near Dingo Flat. Anon he swept the horizon with a pair of powerful field glasses- (those glasses had often -been- the means of saving his liberty), A solitary rider was galloping across the plain, travelling as if a bush fire were jpur su'ng. 'Seems to be in a hurry,' muttered Ubique. /'Why, if it's not Mrs. Dawlish. Wonder if� but no, that cannot be.' Seeing no signs of any other riders, Ubique rode out to meet the lady. 'Why- this mad speed?' he questioned. Mrs. Dawlish, with the outlaw's assis tance, dismounted almost reeling with ex haustion from the effects of her mad ride. . 'I've taken it upon myself to bring the money,' she sobbed. 'My husband died yesterday.' 'Great heavens. Was it an accident?' 'No; he waa always subjectito fits and the shock of losing his building 'brought on a severe; attack. He rajlied towards the end an4- ^Ving me to Ins- side, bade me �ke a letter' irom the safe in his room;

TaUwHtr6 a8si6!^d ier to * 8ea^ uP�a * ''Why did you ride to me so fast?*' he ? exclaimed. . .-?? ? 'Steele announced, his intention of fol lowing you immediately,' she replied 'So I came straight on.' Ubique �erused the letter she had brought, while ehe watched the lines deepen on his face as he read. Finally lie P^edthe letter in his pocket-book, i P, , ,ua* �e courage to clear me at last, he laughed. 'Cleared me when it -b too late.' Mrs. Dawlish arose end laid her hand up on hia. shoulder. 'Forget it. Every word you utter is like a stab to me. I feel as if 1 Were equally guilty.' _ /'Not at all; you were not to know. But it s too late; I've sunk into crime too deeply to hope for pardon now.' 'You will alwaj's find a shelter at Kan amba, police or no police,' Mrs. Dawlish, exclaimed. 'I believe you,' returned Ubique. 'And some day I may ask for more than even your generosity can give.' Mrs. Dawlish blushed. 'I doubt it,' she exclaimed dropping her e3'es under' his ar dent gaze. 'We shall gee. But there's someone coming over the rise,' he burst out. Ele vating his glasses, he gazed long and in tently. 'Ah. My friend, Steele and several others,' he remarked. 'Well, I must say Au revoir,' but never fear, I shall re turn.' 'What about the money?' Bhe exclaimed as he mounted without it. He stooped and, raising her hands to his lips,^ sent he hot blood rushing to her face, 'borne other day � a day more appro priate� I may ask for more than the money; but at present I take nothing from you.' 'Tell them I am goiDg to Melbourne/'' he shouted gaily. 'It- will put Seele off the scent. ' Au revoir,' he added as he galloped madly away. Mrs. Dawlish continued to watch his devil-may-care figure until it was loet to view 'He Eaid he would return, and when he 

 uueo ue aiiau. nave nis reward, slie mur mured. And, riding back on her tracks, she met Steele and his party. 'Out by yourself, Mrs. Dawlish,' ex claimed Steele. 'Surely that's rather im prudent, with this outlaw in the neighbor hood?' Mrs. Dawlish laughed. Holding up the parcel of money in full view, she said, 'It doesn t seem so, Mr. Steele, for he refused to take the money and rode away.' ,_He s a strange fellow,' muttered Steele. 'Which way did he go, Mrs. Dawlish?' .He b miles away to the south by now; said he was going to Melbourne as' he rode away.' 'We had better return.' Steele nro 

 posed. 'It's not much use following him with the start he's got.' The party rode bacK in silence, Mrs. Dawlish secretly joyful that Ubique had es caped. Steele, watching lier covertly, was rasy with his thoughts. 'Gone to Met -ourne,' he muttered. 'I knew by her ace it- was only a ruse. I'll pretend to leave, and hang around the station incog., and we shall see� yes, we shall see.' But Mrs. Dawlish wore a happy smile at dinner that evening. 'I'm not ' far out,'- muttered Steele as he watched-lier face. (Te be continued.)
