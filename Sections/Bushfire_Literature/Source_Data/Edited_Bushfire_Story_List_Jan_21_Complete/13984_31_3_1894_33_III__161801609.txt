 CHAPTER. III. 

 The return of the eldest <011 end heir to the station oreated the usual amount of gosBip in the diatriot. All kept up the character he had first assumed of careless liberality, and did not interfere with Robert's management. He soon renewed his intimaoy with the Rudders, and, as was but natural, became a devoted admirer of Kate's. On her part it was only to be supposed that she should feel interested in.bim. Be had plenty to talk about that had a pertain charm of novelty; his adventures during the Zulu War and in the outside districts of Australia were told without boasting, and served to put him on a small heroic pedestsl in the community. 

 As may ba presumed, this intimaby with ths Rudders was not at all to Robert's liking; and both men felt that it was, after all, but a hollow truoe between them, and one that might be ruptnred at any. moment. Kate Rudder had. no thought of arpnsing the younger brother's jealousy by treating the .elder so intimately. She sincerely liked Robert, and it only wanted a word from him to awaken a warmer feeling. 

 Unfortunately, it was different with Alf. He had fallen head over ears in love with Kate, and felt oertain that it was returned. It was evident that.auoh a state of thinga could not go on long without an explosion of some aott.' Blanche had long guessed Robert's secret, and was prepared to become an aotive ally should the turn of affairs neoesaitate it. 

 The smothered feud broke out one night when the two men were smoking a pipe before retiring. � 

 "I intend to trr.myluok to-morrow," eaid Alf. " It's time I settled down and got mar 

 ried." 

 "I quite agred with you," returned Robert, somewhat meaningly, "Whrre are you going to condescend to throw the handker chief?,' 

 "oh, don't put on side. You know very well I am going to ask Kate Rudder, and have every reason to suppose she will say yes." 

 "It's a lie,"replied Bob.furiously, a Budden I gust of passion oompletoly overcoming him. 

 Alf started, but 'obeoked himself. " I oan afford to laugh at you," he said. " Rave 

 aws^; it won't whistle your sweetheart baok." 

 you put your boast to .the test to 

 morrow," said Robert in a oalinertone, "you | will find yourself mistaken. I should advise 

 you to stay at home." 

 " Keep your advice to yourself, and don't provoke me," eaid the other, who was now in 

 his torn losing his temper. 

 "Provoke you, indeed!" repeated Robert contemptuously. 

 "Yes, you beggar, or I'll soon get rid of 

 vou." 

 "As you did Sam!" 

 Alf leaped to his feet, epeeohless with a mixlure of rage and fear. Next minute the two' men would have been at eaoh other's throats, but the door opened, and Blanche entered. "I heard your voioes raised," ehe eaid, affecting not to notioe their menacing attitudes; " what are you quarrelling about ?" 

 "Oh,'we never could agree of old,"-eaid Robert, trying to oalm himeelf ae hie eister approaohedhim. 

 ' " Look here, my fine fellow, eaid Alf, " to morrow you take yourself, bag and baggago, out of this; and just see that your aocounte are square when .1 come to overhaul them." 

 RobertVface turned fiery.red ; but Blanolie oaugbthis band. "If Bob goes, I go too," 

 ehe said. 

 " You are quite weloome," returned Alf, who had oompletely dropped the mask. 

 " I will give you full satisfaction about the station aooounta to-morrow morning," eaid Robert; " and in a Bhort time I trust you will be able to give an equally satisfactory account of what I shall require from you." 

 " What do you mean ?" demanded the other fiercely. 

 " Simply I do not believe your version of your trip out west. I will see what BurgeBt has to say in the matter." 

 " You will have to go to another place than Queensland, then, for he is dead." 

 "Oh, you knew that, did you? And yet you pretended to ask after him." 

 " Pshaw I I will not stop to listen to any more nonsense. To-morrow I will Bhow you who iB master here." He lef t the room. 

 The brother and sister had a long conver sation, during which, for.the first time, Robert told her about the buried papers and what he suspected of their. import. Blanch was naturally horrified, and reiterated her now fixed determination to leave on the following day. Robert impressed upon her the necessity of absolute secrecy; and they were about parting, when she asked him where he was going to when he left. For her self, ehe was going on a visit to an aunt for 

 a while. 

 mm going I0 CDa lvorcnern j/erricory or 

 South Australia to look for Jim Turner," 

 he said. 

 Ab beapolce, he bad his hand on the door, and half opened it. A noise outside struck bis ear, and he threw it wide open, and looked along the passage. A dark shadow vanished at the end as he did so, and it immediately occurred to him that Alf bad been listening. 

 "Forewarned is forearmed," be thought as he retired. "I must guard against Master Alf getting any inkling of those papers, or he will be beforehand with me," Then he thought that if Alf bad been listening he would have heard all he oonfided to Blanohe, but on second consideration, he remembered thab they bad spoken low, all but the last words referring to Jim Turner, and it would be hard to trace anything from that, 

 Blanohe had given her brother a hint that he bad better test his fate with Kate Rudder as soon as practicable, and he .determined to do it the first thing in the morning, if possible before be settled up with his brother. With this objeot in view he was up at daylight, and by sunrise was on his way, calculating that he would arrive at the Rudders' Station in time for breakfast, lie managed to bit the meal very nioelv; and while seated thereat, he informed his friends of bis resignation, or rather deposition, in favour of his eldest brother. As the terma on whiob the two men stood were pretty well known, this intimation did not surprise anybody. It elicited, however, a quiok glanoe of sympathy from Kate, which was sufficient satisfaction 'or Robert. ? He soon made an opportunity to ask the momentous question. As two shipsoonvergetowards each other in raid-ooean on a oalm day, so the wooing and the wooed have a silent oooult speech of their own whioh is better than an outspoken language, and Berves just as well to convey the intended meaning. In the old nursery and schoolroom, now turned into a lonely kind of lumber-room seldom visited. Rate and Robert plighted their troth; and then ha departed with a light heart to seek the con 

 sent of her parent Old Rudder half ex pected what was coming, and Robert was de lighted to find that the return of the rightful heir did not affeob hi^Weoit. The fact waa that Budder had'seen enough of bim_and his management during the put ten pears to feel assured tnnt young Fatten was one of the men bound to rise, and than the present would be merely a temporary eolipse. 

 The fifteen miles home�home no longer 

 were soon covered, and he entered the bouse te find his half-brother waiting lor him. To his surprise Alf approaohed him in the sunniest manner possible. " Rook here, old tnan,"besaid; "we shall always be snarling at eaoh other, I suppose, at long as we are together; bnt let us have a try to do better in future at any rate. I will take baok anything I said last night, if you will do the same." 

 '* 1 have made np my mind to go away and Strikeout for myself," returned Robert, after a pause. " As you admit, we should always he quarrelling; ao it is best to part. I am glad it is not in anger, and am willing to forget the hasty words exchanged last night." 

 �' I suppose that is as muoh as I oan expeot from you," replied the other. "Go. or stay, I snail not quarrel with you." 

 After a hasty packing up, Robert and his sister a tatted in a buggy to the neighbouring township of W�, whsnoe they would take the train to Sydney, where Robert intended to leave Blanche with their aunt. 

 Meanwhile Alf went headlong to his fate. He had determined to propose to Kate Rudder, and rode over that day for the pur pose. What he then learned did not improve hie temper. He rode home in a mood of . sullen spite, revolving In his mind the best way to obtain his own will and thwart hia rival. 

 Robert wrote a short but explioit letter to Owen, the Manager of Bendabar, on whom he 

 thonght he oould rely, asking him to observe < the striotest retioence oonosrning the bnried papers and their whereabouts, and if any one turned up enquiring for them, to put the seeker, if possible, on a fatso soeut. He further took him into his confidence concern 

 ing the return of bis eldeat brother, sup posed to be dead; and also told him of hia purposed quest for Turner, who seemed to he the only man who oould point out the hiding-place. He then made a hasty trip to W to say good-bye to his sweetheart, and staftsd ostensibly Co look for a suitable pastoral investment; in reality, he took the 

 first steamer for Port Darwin. 

 A long narrow olearing through a dense torub of upright "mulga." In the centre of this cleared track runs a row of telegraph poles, supporting a eingle wire, the slender link that traverses the Australian Continent from north to south, and binds it with an almost living boDd to the rest of the world. At the edge of this thioket of mulsra is a patch ef open oountry, thinly timbered with oooli bah trees. Here, alongside the rude dray track that winds side by aide with the line, are a couple of iron tanke, eaob ooutaining about four bundred gallons of water, tanks euoh as are used on board of sailing ships. A line-repairing party are oamped on this open spot, and the tsnke are kept full for the use of the men employed in the maintenance of the hue. There are three men in the oamp�an operator and two line-men�it is the middle of the day, and they are Caking it easy in the shade; their riding and paok horsee, hobbled nut, are feeding a short distance away. 

 " Here cornea the man they were telling ne about when we spoke Daly Waters Station," suddenly remarked the operator, gazing up ihelongnorthern vietaof the line. 

 "The man who is in searoh of Jim?" said one of the uen, glancing at the third, who looked rather oonecioue. 

 Jim, who was tbe long-sought-for Jim Turner, busied himself in putting the fire together and placing a quart pot of water on to boil, for hospitality is the eaored oreed of tbe bush ; and the party were silent until the stranger rode up to the oamp and die mounted. 

 " I suppose you are the repairing party from Daly Waters ?" eaid the new comer, after the ou'tnmarv greetings. 

 "Yea,"returned the operatorand I pre Bume you are the man th**y wired to me about looking for Jim Turner. This is Turner, "and be indicated the man in question. 

 The two nodded," and Fatten�for it was Kobert�remarked, "I have had a long hunt for you. I suppose you are wondering what it is all about?" 

 " Better turn your horses out and have something to eat." interrupted the operator; "plenty of time for business afterwards." 

 ratten aooepted the invitation; and after eating his meal and finishing the regulation pi|>e, drew Turner on one aide and broaohed the objeot of hie visit. 

 "You were etookman on Bendabar," he said, "and wore .with Mr. Hopwood when you piaked up BargesB." Turnerassented. "The faot is eimply this, You left Burgess to rest down there, while you went up to the Station, got fresh horses, and came down again. _ While you were away, he buried certain papers he had, enclosing them in an old salmon tin that be bad pioked up there. He is dead now; but before he died, he wrote and told me of these papers, giving me direotions to find them by means of the marked trees about. I went to the place; hut it ie now all changed. The trees have been cut down; and a heavy flood has altered the appearanoe and size of the water-boles in the river. No one on the station knew the exact place; and as the clue he had given me was ueelesB, my only obanoe was to find Hop wood or youreelf; so I ad vertised in the lead ing papers." Patten paused. 

 " I never knew of the advertisement until the other day," said Turner; " and then one of the ohapB spotted it in an old number of the Australasian. Did you hear from Mr. Hopwood t" 

 " Yes ; and he wrote and eaid that, under theohanged oironmstanoes, he did not believe that he oonld point out the exeat spot." 

 " Then I'm blowed if I oonld," said Turner. 

 This was hard on Fatten, and he hesitated for a moment. "Look here, Turner," he re turned ; " there's no oooasion to speak baBtily. Think the matter over, and see if you oannot remember any slight thing that will bring it baok to you." 

 Turner pondered for a short time. "I might find the plane if I was baok there," he hazarded doubtfully at last. 

 "It's most important that I get these papers," went on Robert. "I have been tracking you up now for six months, and I am not going to be baulked for a trifle. I believe if you were on the apotit would all oome baok to you. I will tell you what I will do. I suppose your billet here ie nothing very much. You could do as well in Queens land t� 

 " .Tust as well," was the answer. 

 "Then I will pay your expenses round to the plaoe, and allow you a couple of pounds a week during the time we are travelling. If we are suooessful in getting the papers, or what is left of them, I will give yon a hundred pounds." 

 "I'min it," cried Jim, without any hesita tion ; and they turned baok to the oamp. 

 Fasten was sound asleep that night when 

 he mi suddenly aroused by somebody shak ing him by the shoulder. Rousing himself, he 

 found it was Turner. 

 "It has all tome baok to me,"he said in an exoited sort of whisper. "I by there thinking about pioking up that man, and trying to puzzle out how I oould make sure of the place, when all of a sudden 1 remembered about filling the quart pots. Right straight under our camp a bar of rook crossed the bed of the rivet. I re member it well because the water was deep just alongside, and it was so bandy to stand on and dip the quarts, Of oonrse, Mr. Hop wood doesn't recall it beoause be didn't go down the bank; but I was down two or three times." 

 " By Jove, that's something definite," re turned Robert; "but I noticed several bare crossing the river here and there." 

 " Ah 1 but this one was a slate bar with a seam of quarts running beside it. No flood oould alter that, oould it?" 

 "I shouldn't think so,"said Patten. 

 They left the camp; and in due time they arrived in Eeppel Bay,,where, leaving the mail steamer in which they had travelled, they as oended the Vitzroy River in the tender. Robert stood on the wharf waiting for his luggage to be put ashore, when a hand was laid on his 

 shoulder. He turned to find his half-brother besidehim. 

 "I expected, you Bob," he said. "Now, 

 supposing we make this little trip to Bendebar 

 together. 

 Robert was scarcely surprised at the unwel come appearance of his half-brotber. He bad all along suspected that he had overheard his conversation with hiB sister relative to the sesroh' for Jim Turner, and natnrally would have kept a watoh on his move ments. He therefore aooepted the situa tion without muob comment; but as soon as he oould get away without exciting sus picion, made his way to the telegraph offioe. Here he wired to Owen at Bendabar, giviDg him the olue of the rooky bar and all other details furnished by Turner. He asked him to follow the eearoh up at once, and if suo oeeeful, to keep the papers until hie arrival, and restore the spot where they were found to its original state, as though it had been undisturbed. This done, he felt more at ease. 

 He knew that Alf would soon get all be wanted to know out of poor, simple Jim; and he was not at all sure that he did not in tend to play him some trick on the way up and get ahead of him. . The. four hundred miles to the station were, however, negotiated without any mishap. He did not trust him self to exchange glances with Owen, lest Alf'e sharp eyes ehould note it; but as soon as there was an opportunity, the Manager told him that he had been quite euooeesiul. The papers were still iu the tin ; but Robert begged bis friend to keep tbem where they were until the faroe of a search had been gone 

 through. 

 Next morning they started down the river j and Jim Turner soon identified the spot where they were camped when Burgess appeared. Needless to say, the searoh�extended into the next day�was fruitless. The general conclu sion was that if Burgess had buried anything, it had been only just beneath the surface, and the tin was probably soon laid bare. In that case, the fiiBt bush fire that swept over the spot would destroy the oontents. 

 AH did not seem at all elated at the faot that nothing had transpired ; and Robert guessed that the state of unoertainty was worse to him than the discovery of the hidden tin would have been. 

 Jim Turner was rewarded; and Alf took his leave, Robert announcing his attention of spending a few days with his frieDd Owen. From something he notioed in Alf's manner, he mistrusted the faot that he bad really left the station, and believed that bis suspicions had been aroused by the non-'disoovery of any thing, and that he was still keeping a watch on his movements. So impressed was he with thiB idea, that it was not until be retired and locked himself in his bedroom that he com menced his investigation'. The tin had preserved its contents with w inderful fidelity. On lifting the-lid the papers appeared to be in almost as good a state of preservation as when first placed there. There were three folded papers and a small notebook. He opened the folded papers. They were all in his brother Sam's writing, in penoil, and, by a strange ooinoidenoe, he read them in their proper sequenoe. The first was addressed to himself, and ran :�" Dear Bob�We have had back luck, and worst of all, I have met with an accident that has crippled me. I am just scribbling this to say good-by in oase things take a turn for the bad. If I don't 

 turn no again, yon know how to aot for the : good of all at home." Then followed some affeotionate messages to his mother and sisters. 

 The seoond paper bore date the next day, and was but a few lineB :�" Burgess haB oome baok. I am much worse, in awful pain; shall never leave here. Thank God, 1 am not de serted by everybody." 

 The third and last was almost illegible; the reader managed to deoipher�"Burgess will tell�too bad�I had forgiven�now left here�die. The rest was unintelligible. 

 Robert dropped the message from the dead man whose bones lay in the desert. His half-brother's name was not mentioned ; but he read the whole story as though it had been printed. Sam had met with an acoident, and Alf bad left bim to get on as best he oould. But what was the aooident ? and how did be meet with it! The notebook would tell him that. 

 He took it np and opened it. Just then all the dogs on the station oommenoed to bark furiously, as though some one 'as ooming. He opened his window and looked out; but all seemed, quiet; and after a fight amoog tbemBelves the dogs subsided into 

 silence. 

 He oommenoed the notebook, wherein Bur gess had, as he said, told the true story of 

 Sam'B death. 

 "I promised Sam Patten when he was dying that I would tell the truth; and I swore to Alf, after he saved my life from the blacks, that I would not. I will write it all down ; hide it, and never speak of it again. I don't know what to do. Prom the start Alf Patten made himself disagreeable ; and althongh Sam stood it very quietly for some time, at last he quarrelled with him; and after that, there was nothing but rows between them. The morning we found five of the horses poisoned they bad the worst quarrel. Alf was away, when we camped the night before, and he blamed his brother for not notioing the poison plant about. While they were still at it, the blaok boy and I started after two of the horses that had strayed away. While we were track ing them np, we both thought we beard a pistol shot in the direction of the oamp. When we got baok with the borses, we found that there had been an aooident. Sam, while doing something to his revolver, had aoaidentally touched the trigger and shot himself through the hand. That was the storv they told us. It was a olean wound; and I did not think it would turn out bad. We had good � ountry and easy travelling for a day or two, and Sam's hand seemed getting on very well; then we had a long dry stage and hot weather. Sam's hand took a turn for the worse, and when we got to some good water and grass, he 

 said he ooald go no farther, bat must stay there until his hand was easier. Eversinoe that 

 morning the brothers had not spoken, and 'Sam would not let hie brother help mm in any way. We spent three days at the water hole, and the rest and plenty of. oold water bandages did the wound good. A If had been getting very impatient, and nt last he said that we had oome nearly as far as we wanted to, and seen most of the country they had oome to look at; that the best thing to do was for Sam to stop in the camp, while we went on about fifty miles further, and then we could go home by easy stages. This meant that we should he,away from Sam for nearly "three days, and I would hot agree to it. But Sam himself persuaded me; he was anxious to get home, and thought that by the time we got book be would be able to ride, and thpre would be nothing, to detain us. We started the next morning. While we were paoking and saddling the horses, Alf went up and spoke to his brother. Whatever it was be said, the quarrel broke out again at once, and when we started, Alf bad gone back to one of his fiendish tempers. We went about thirty "miles that day and oamped. The next morning, as we were starting, I asked Patten how far we were going before turning baok. He said�' Right on to the Overland Tele graph Line.' I pulled up, and said I would go no farther, but would return, to the oamp. He argued with me that Sam was all right, and even tried to threaten me; but I rode away, and he and the black boy went on. 

 '*1 got back to oamp that evening, and found Sam very bad. I think the excitement of the quariel with hiB brother had inflamed the wound again. Next morning he was in terrible agony, and his arm was swollen right up to the shoulder. He was delirious, and 

 kept praying me to out his arm off. I never left his side except to get water to keep the bandages wet. The next afternoon he sud denly fell asleep, but woke np just at sundown. He was quite sensible, and had no pain at all; only, he said, 'he felt too weak to move.' He talked to me quietly about going baok, thinking, now the pain had loft him, he would be strong enough to ride in the morning. He told me that his wound was not an aooident, 

 bat that his brother in a fit of passion had. threatened biin with hie revolver : that he had tried to take it from him, and in the struggle it had gone off and shot him throngh the hand. He never meant to eay anything about it, but tor his brother going away and leaving him ; and asked me to tell the true story if anything happened to him, and I promised. Presently, he said to me�'This is heavenly to be free from that terrible pain; I shall sleep so soundly to-night, old man.' He never apoke again. I scarcely know-when he died, but I think it was about an hour after wards.
