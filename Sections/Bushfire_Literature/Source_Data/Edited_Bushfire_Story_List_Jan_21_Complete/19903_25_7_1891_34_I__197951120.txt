 CHAPTEa L I 

 The time of year was early Kovember-thd I advanced stage of spring when tho country lanes I and slopes of Tasmania are loveliest with tho I blossoms of the hawthorn�when the air u I sweetest with the scent of the wild briar roses. I The afternoon wa3 full of warm suhlnM I 

 light ; the sky w&3 a faint blue ; the white clouds were beginning now slowly to turn to gold as the sun drew nearer the mountain range, .All the land about was covered with grass and clover � thick and sweet from yesterday's rain and the gum tree3 were bright with the red and yellow tints of their spring-time foliage. Down in a Utile hollow, near the river, tho magpies were getting ready for their eren song-a clear swift note from some bird still on the wing, and then sudden silence. In the distance were the outlines of a big red house� from its clustering chimneys blue smoke was rising into the air. In a field uncultivated, but luxuriant with grass, a girl sat in a sort of dell upon a fallen log. She was the chief object of interest to the roau who had. been, loitering, sketch book in hand, for some time m her neighborhood. - She was evidently in deep reverie. ' '' " 1 ' He had come closer now, and stood leaning against the hawthorn hedge chat enclosed the field, resfcuig;;his"'elbow. open &: little cleared space of rail where the boughs had fallen away. Why should I not speak to her?" was the question be was'aiking himself; "it can do no harm" � then, after a pause � ,l at least to me" This reflection finally decided the matter for him. He was a bold and rapid sketcher. In&few minutes bo had caught the pose of the slender figure ;.tbe face bent forward a little; the brown straw hat pushed to the back of tho head; the hands loosely clasped in front about her knees : the pensive curve of the lip ; the soft outline of the cheek; the large eyes wide open, fixed in ahscractiun. He stepped through a gap in the hedge and walked up to her, startling her from hcrreverie. "Pardon me," he said, raising his hat as he spoke, "I ought to have asked permission Brstf I have put yon in- my sketch. You made so charming a foreground I could not resist,. Shy I show it to you f , . "If you please," was her reply, made simply. Sho hall risen, surprised, stammering a little� it was so rare a tiling to be spoken to by a stranger � yeV there was uo awkwardness in her maimer. . . She, too, had been sketching, but with very inartistic materials� a hard pencil and sheet of writing paper held open upon a book. They feu to the ground as she rose; he hastened to p:ck them up and restore them with another defer ential smile and bow. . She looked at the sketch be held before her for a. moment or two nervously�the. color ccmin-x and going in her cheeks. "Well?" .. . "I am afraid you have made it too lovely for me," she said, at length compelling herself to reply, in response to the .urgency of hiswna I cannot think that I am quite. like that. _ , <k Pardon me again; lio- I "have not beeo able to do you justice.

It would be too errata strain upon on invalid to bo troubled with callers. But you know tho Stanwiths, I i of course, although they nro some inilas from I pnow no ono actually," sho replied with an I accent of mournfuluoss thot did not oscapo liim. "I know them by name only. - My cousin is known to them; but wo livo quite apart from other people." . . , - . . "That must ho very sad for yon, ho said in a tono of respectful compassion; " But you know of tho Stanwiths," ho wont: on moro energeti cally. "You soo I am compelled to offer you their naiho as o Bort of credential of my respec tability� uuIosb you will toko my word for it;' Something in his smilo ' more than his tone made Ruth think that ho regarded her as a simplo country girl, who treated n. very ordinary inciuoiit as n matter of importance, and without dourly knowing, why bIio folt that it was. duo to her dignity to remove this impression. , ; " Ob, certainly 1 " she Baid, with a littlo air of oraoionsncss which he thought sat very, prettily upon her, "and indeed I think it vciy kind of you to. wish to tako so much trouble� only I must go now.". , , ... . "Which is your way? " ho asked smilingly. "Across the field, and down the lane to the mninrond." ! "And that is my way too, as. far as tho main road. May I hnvo tlio honor of walking with you os far as our ways go ? " !'�,.., Riitli mutmhrod a low assent. She. did not know wliether ako was doing right or wrong, but she was aware that shehad a focling.that she would like him to come. ; ,, Ho gathered up her drawing materials, and plaooit them under liis arm along with his own, and lhovoila bramblo out of licr path as she walked; And Ruth, who was unaooustoraod to attention, and, moreover, ntten tion from a man � young, good looking, with white hands and well out clotlios, distinguished also by on air of fine couitcsy and easo of bearing � felt a strange sense of elation ns sho ivalkcd by his side, mingled with a feeling of unronlity, as though tho whole occurrence wero a dream. . " My people at homo;" he soid as thoy walked along, " are somo relations of tho Stanwiths � cousins or something of thokind. I really have notyot taken the trouble to make out exactly what." Tho shado of ennui in Ills manner when lie spoke of what had reforcnoo to. himself ' both puzzled and interested Ruth. She did not under stand its drift, but it seamed to suggest a new world of foeling into whiob she had not .yot penetrated. "But you like staying thoro? " Bho asked ten tatively. ...... . He gave a little eough, which agaln'secmed to Ruth to imply many things unknown to her ; but ho replied oracularly : " The bucolio ideal of existence is not attraotivo to me, espeoially upon so near an acquaintance. It seems to con sist ohiofiy of riotous ohildron and ponderous dinners. But then they ore so very kind � I am most graciously treated," ho addod in a warmer tone, as though ho feared Ruth should think his formor remarks too slighting, " only thoy seem to mo so somnolent after the world I havo come from� life here Booms to stand still. There is a general - air of repose about Doepdoau ; dou't you think so? " ho asked, with an appealing smilo, as, though to say, "I am quite at your mercy in this matter." "I don't know," said Rutli simply, and a little puzzlod as to how sho ought to reply. : "I havo never been anywhere else, but I suppose it must seem so to anyouo ootuiug from the great world. . " And tho groat world too oan become small and Insufficient," he said in a low tone that im plied varied reminiscences,' then he added witli considerable lengthening of manner, "Deepdeau is very delightful to me. At least," his oyos resting upon her face oxpressively, "I begin to sie that it may bo ; perhaps I did not quite think' so yesterday afternoon." Her vivid blush was a tacit eonfession that Bjie understood this vcilod compliment, though she only replied "I hope it will provo pleasant to you." Thoy liad now reaohed tho main road. Ruth came to a pause and waving her hand in tho np'- ward direction said, but hesitntingly, as though sho feared to seem ungracious, "That is the way to Roseneath ; and this is mine,','. And so you nro going to dismiss in'o?" ho asked. "Will you not allow me to walk with yon os for as your home ?" , ''Oh lilqase do not," Ruth returned urgently, . - couldn t give you so much trouble ; you liavo sues a long way to go." He had too muoh savoirfaire to press the mattor, but ho restored her drawing materials witli an air that' emphasised his reluctance - to port with them.' I: am so sorry you will have fully0"17 "lesa things," he said regrets But then I always do have to carry thorn," Ruth quite simply replied, '8 no' my fault that I was not bore, 'I no said in tho tone of one who wished it to be unueratood that he considered that fate hail in ,? instance treated him unkindly. Ruth walked lingoringly up tho road. All along it soomcd to hor that the sweet briar that Hedged tho fields was swootor than evor this evening. And why was it that that under win ii v moprnfulncas which usualty went hor obiorvatlons of nature was absent l- filing of alertness of Bpirit� of �-i, human things� seemed to have rnscn its place. � ' ClIAPTKIl II. y1' 0,1 "" l,ox' afternoon, had gone but homn k!!r P��'8 down the main road from lior inn i� ,r?s'10 "-aw liar new acquaintance com- . � 0 'J88'1 her.

OTiinti? " B'?s tgive me my sitting ?" ho asked �eteefrr,makins apetition' bsthoy Ruth had spont all tho morning debating the rightfulness or wrongfulness of the proceeding : yet all sho could shy now was, hesitatingly, Are you sure it will not trouble you." - Trouble 1" he repented, with a fine reproach In both eyes and voico. "Is it not what I have boon looking forward to over since wo parted yostordoy? It will make me infinitely happy to paint your portrait. Is that assurance onough ?" ho asked with an encouraging smile.' Rutjji's down bent gazo and murmured reply satisfied bim that it was. 4 .When they" bad reaohed tho doll, ho ashed Kutli to sit down jnat as sho had sat yesterday, liion, to distract hor nttontion -and put her quito at lior . easo, ho talkod of ono thing and another, proceeding tho whilo rapidly with liis work. _ Frosontly ho brought the completed sketch for hor inspection, Ruth marvelling nil tho while at the rapidity and ease with, which ho had put tho, colors on. Sho surveyed it now with much interest as ho held it before licr. It is wonderful," nho said, tho pleased smilo playing about her lips, as sho looked at so lovely a presentment of hor own face, then, as though she feared hor elation might seem childish in his eyes, "Do you think I am quite liko that� I think you must havo made me better than I am "No' ho said with an nccont of almost reverential fervor. "You aro uot quito liko that, for this reason that this is only a skotoh, not a finished portrait. You nro moro than tlfis ! I should want several sittings before I could do you justice. "Will you give thorn to mo f ' Thero was tho ring of earnestness in his tono. In truth lie found Ruth's unconscious ness of her lovciinesB one of hor greatest charms. It seemed iu some way to him to fit in har moniously with her surroundings � with the place itself. It was refreshing, moreover, to a man always in search of a now sensation, from its novelty : in tho world he had come fr<Tm he had found for the most part that tho possessors of loveliness were auito ready to cstimato their possession at its adequate value. " If it wHl give you any pleasure, yes," Ruth replied, this time almost without hesitation. Tho prosont experience was so delightful to her that she was beginning to lose her vaguo senso of troublo about its being right. A now world had suddenly opened to her gaze, and with a ouriosity liko to that of a child sho could not liolp vouturing in to boo what it was liko. " If I could only paint like that V said Ruth still looking at hor portrait. "AVe shall seo, he replied, all animation. Ho sat down beside her and gavo her n lesson in drawing. He found his pupil apt and full of the desire to learn, and so it happened that with these several diversions thoy were at least half on hour later as they walked down the lauc than on the day bofore. Forawcok after this night, a week of suoli perfect weather as is perhaps only to be found m the inland part of Tasmania, they mot every day. And Ruth was almost happy. Only almost, because of something sho felt rather than understood about Raymond Hamilton, that his past threw a shadow ovor his present. This feeling came from somothing in liis manner, from hia vague uttoranccs about himself. Ami to Ruth, who knew absolutely nothing of tho world, these things were a aourco of uneasiness becauso she could attach no definite meaning to them. He bad an air as though something in his pnBt appealed to overy tender hearted woman's pity and love. His good looks, liis grAooful ways, his littlo air of weariness of all things. 44 1 have not boon a good man, I know, but perhaps if you knew all you would not altogether blamo me," was his nearest approach to a con fession of past sins and follies. Then lie would Bigh doeply and veil his eyes with a look of im penetrable gloom. It was his way to entrench himself behind these vaguo uttorancos. Had it been demanded of him to be moro definite he would have been somewhat puzzled to know how to reply, for in truth he had not been very bad. His nature was not largo enough for cither exalted good ness or vigorous Bin. AVerc tho dilfercut kinds of men catalogued like moths lie might havo been set down in the order of ophemorn. Ho had lost muoh of hia patrimony in tho pursuit of pleasure aud he was was somewhat woariod of hia unsatisfactory lifo. Still he had doue nothing vrhioh society, with its large charity for suoh offenders, had uot already condoned. He followed tho profession of an artUt, somo- what in tha dilettante's fashion. But the whole bent of his nature was artistic, and tliio artistic olement mado itself npparont in tho ohoico and pursuit of every object which engaged kin attention. Moroly coArsc pleasures had no charm for him � thoy must be all at leat surrounded by sentimont. Conscience in him was not activo. Ho had, indeed, his moments of contrition whon tho thought of a wounded heart left somewhero in hia track suddenly assailed him, but then thc3Q reminders be longed to the category of east winds and rainy skies, thing< which which the lighter order of artists holds iu especial aversion. That ho was always ready, with the attraction of n now object, to go through tho samo experience wont to prove that the deterrent efFect of theso con- tritional moments were but slight. It had become the absorbing passion of his lifo to play tho role ho was now enacting with Ruth � to pose as tlio world woary soul, more ainncd against than sinning, aonsitive to blamo and mia- understood by liis compeers. Ho had oome upon Ruth upon that first even ing by ncoklcnt. A skilled reader of faces, ho saw at once that bora whs an impressionable nature. ; The discovery, awoke instantly all i tho dosire for a fresh experience, in which, delicate shades of fceliugs i should enter. . - Too selfish and too thoughtless to cArc' what the : result -wight be to this new object of interest, he had resolved to sketch her face, partly- Because its loveliness so delighted him, partly aa a means of speaking to hor. Chaitkr III. Ruth lived, as she had told Raymond Hamil ton, with her cousin, filias Morpeth, tho only relative known to hor in tho world. Years ago Miss Morpeth linil come out from Eugland, whero all tho tragedy, if tragedy thero had been, a't any rate aU that made life for her, hod been enacted. Somo waro'of fnto or circumatanco had swept hor to Tasmania, another onwards to tho small island town of Deepdoan. Sho had oome out possossed with hut one idea, that her cousin, Mrs. Gower, to whom, aa a girl, ohe had been passionately attached, was dead, and that it was licr duty to seek out and look after tho littlo daughter that Mrs. Gower had left behindher. AVith such wit asreinained to her upon landing in Tasmauia, _ she sought out and took possession of this ohild, who had been placed by charity at a cheap hoarding school, whera she was wretched, ana settled down in Deepdoan. But all this liad happened o great many years ago. Ruth had passed from childhood to girl- 

 hood, from girlhood to womanhood, and now it seemod as if the mere process of living would go on indefinitely. Thoro was nothing to mark the flight of time. Both Ruth and hor cousin hadlost count of ycarB. They had neithor fast days nor festivals, no celebrations of any kind. Thoy hod only the slonderest intercourse with the outer world, and that chiefly the necessary dealings with tradespeople. Tlio small beginnings of courtesies with tho different families of standing around Dccpdcan had long ngo ceased. Ono evening, Raymond Hamilton; walking homo with Ruth, said in a voico in which ho managed to couvcy the impression that his soul was burdened with tho thought 'of what ho spoke, "That it would be anothei- wholo week boforo fato 'would allow him to walk homo with her again. His affaire in Hobart would occupy him at least a week. It would be a vory -long week to him," ho looked at Ruth lingoringly, and with so muoh meaning in his eyes that tho color deepened instantly iu hor ohceks. "But (when ho returned, then � then," he ropcated with. a triumphant smile and gosturo of his hand oa though to say, " it would bo for Ruth to decide whether or no his real future pbould open before lilm.'? ' He held Ruth's hand a little longer at part ing; looked into her oyes with a more unfathom able look than ovor, and Bpoko vaguely of his dreams. ' tTcrhaps at the time he meant at least' as much as he Baid. There was always an atmosphere of indefinitcncss about him. He was of such an cphomcral nature that lie could woll mean ono thing at one hour and forget all about it the next. On the afternoon that Mr. Hamilton had said he would be back Ruth felt the same desiro to attire herself in her best and look her sweetest as any happy woman waiting for hor betrothed lover. Yet Mr. Hamilton was not Ruth's lover at all, in the sense that he hnd asked for her lovo ; and still leas had ho defini tely snid that ho loved her. But it had &U beon in the atmosphere. Thero had been such an air of tender devotedness, of such graceful courtesy, in his treatment of her. He had talked vaguely of his past as though something in this present with her had helped to condone it. He had talked of his future as though her iniluenco should help to make the life that somo other influence hnd marred. Thoro hud been no declaration of love, but ho know well enough that he had contrived to make Ruth feel that it would surely come whon the time was ripe for it. And the very indefinitcncss and grace of all this had appealed in the strongest way to tho poetic side of Ruth's nature. The smiles flitted about her lips, the warm color camo and went in her ohceks, as she arrayed herself bofore her glass to meet him. " Should he bo there first, or should sho ?" sho debated. "Porhaps, lie would oome to meet hor and with this thought she lin gered on the road ; but no, ho was not on the road ; he meant that she should keep hor com pact, and meet him in the dell. But when sho reached the dell, and he was not there, a fceliug of desolation suddenly took possession of her. Then sho rallied Uorself. "Something had happened to detain him � she would wait." Sho waited until the long shadows of the trocs grow longer � until they faded altogether. The light went out of. her heart, as if it were out of a landscape. Then through -the kindly dust, that voitcd the white weariness of hor fnco from any curious passer by in the main road, she took her heavy, way homowards. . . ' If Ruth had boon endowed with the clair voyant's gift to see what was going on at n dUtanco, it would have shown hor Raymond Hamilton, through all tho hours of the. lovely afternoon that sho waited to meet hiin, sitting in tlio pleasure gardens at Government Honse, bending over his fair oompanion, arid talking to her with muoh the same air and expression with which lie had talked to Ruth herself a week ago. If it would have dono nothing elso, it would at least havo shown her how usoless were tho toars with which she damped her pillow through the night. , And yot hopo could not die like this all at once. AVith the morning .again, came the thought. "Ho. has beon detained; he will be hero to-day." And aosho attired herself again ; but this time with more nervousness ns to tho result, than with the delight of anticipation of the day before. But he did not come, although sho waited until tho sun had gone down, and left the mountain bofore her a mass of purple gloom. And day after day, for nine long days she waited, aud ho did not come. And still she had 110 insight into his heart to seo that his butterfly nature was for tho time being utterly engrossed with his new object, and that she was quite for gotten. At last tha truth Btruok coldly and clearly on hor heart, that ho did not meau to como any more. Day after day sho had dressed herself in tho protty pale frock, with its delicate lace frills, waiting for tho expootod guest. But to-day, sho folded and put it away with that quietude of manner which which is aoniotimcH more pathetic than tears. She stood looking down at the frock, resting her hands upon tho open drawer for some minutos, " Ah, well," she said at last, in a desolate low voice, that sounded unliko her own, " You were not in keeping with my lifo. Yon had had no thing to do with mo � how could I think It ?" Then prosently eho brought the portrait of herself that Raymond Hamilton had heAUtifully finished for her, laid it with tlio frook, then locked the drawer and put the koy away. Clearly orerything.was over. Yet she could not keep still � despair ivas not yet final � she wan only in the state of feverish prelude to it. Shu grew thin' and wan, but hor eyes had that look of wistful expectanoy which is not despair's final expression. Then one morning her eyes, wero caught by a paragraphia the little newspaper- which Deep- dean published tlirico a week.' The paragraph was t&keu from 0110 of tho Ilobart papers. "Some of our season's guests," it ran, "aro leaving us early. Sir George and Lady Merivalc, with their friend Mr. Raymond Hamilton, the distinguished artist, tpok their departure yester day for Melbourne, whence they proceed by the mail steamer to Kngl&ud. They oxpressed thorn- selves delighted with the scenery, aud the latter takes with Iiirn many charming sketches oa mementoes of his visit.' In the shipping intelli gence wero their names in tho list of one of the steamers that had left the day bofore for Melbourne. For a while Ruth sat utterly silent. Then in a blind, helpless way, she reached for her hat, and wont out of the house. To get away into the heart of Nature� that was tho one desire she had. Sometimes sho sat still, staring at nothing ; but with cvory sense thrilling. Sometimes she wandorcd about, not knowing whero slio wan dered, until night began to fall, and Sarah, the house maid, came out looking for hor. For even Sarah lmd folt lately that there was something very wroug with Miss Rutb, and had begun to fear that she would never come back again. But with the intinot of tho wounded animal which always tries to return to its home, Ruth erept back to the only shelter she knew, Christmas was now f&st drawing near. It had never meant anything to Ruth. She had beon alike shut out from tho church's festivals and from home rejoicings. But, somehow, this year a hopo. hod dawned in her heart, that It would 

 bo clifferont-7it was different. She had other things to bear, Tho inquiring looks of tho people who passod her in tho stroet. Sho know by in tuition that thoy talkod of her pityingly. On OhristmaB.eya Ruth sat at hor bedvoom window listening� but unconsoious that she listened� to the church bolls. ' Tho lilies, , in thoir white purity, whero standing iu tho garden bed beneath her window ; tho honeysuckle twin ing around it shod its swoot incense in the ovon- ingair.. A feeling of ineffable peaeofulbcss. had fallon upon the lnnd; the glow of thosunset still lingered In garden and. field. : J .An .opon Testament was, lying' upon the window sill� porhaps Sarah had put U thero on purpose. - Ruth had looked at it in a motivele-s i why when she first sat down ; now her oyes felt upon it' again, and she be.n aimlossly to read.- The page was open at . tho description of. the agony of Jesus at Gethsetnahe ; and as Ruth read on there. carnc into her. soul something of the meaning of those . words of His, "My soul is. exceeding sorrowful, even hnto death." Presently her tears began to fall� aho wns in a subdued and receptive mood,. Sho.bogan to. see now that in tho largor or the lessor cause it was the lot of somo to suffer. This suffering iii great souls turned to good for otherscould ' liers turn to good for none? She pondered these things for some days, now gaining, now losing strength,. .. ; : ; In the first week of tho New Year she felt impelled to pay a visit to her old friend and their formor servant, Mrs. Ellis. Sarah had told her that morning that one of the ohildrcn was very ill, and Ruth felt that she had rather neglected her of late. After an hour's journey in the afternoon coach, and almost an hour's walk across fields nnd through hnes Ruth came to tho littlo farm. She folt strangely weak and tired� the mental trouble she had gone through had told visibly upon bcr health. Mrs. Ellis, coming, with furrowed, careworn face to the door, at the sound of footsteps, and with a sick baby in ber arms, was shocked at the strange look in ber. " Oh, Miss Ruth, dear," sheoricd, startled inher surpriso, 44 whatevcr's been tho matter with you, and how thin ou'vo got !" Then her voice changed with a new alarm. 44 I'm sorry you've como, Miss Ruth. I don't know whother its safe for you to como in. AVillie was awful bad all day yesterday, and to-day the doctor says its scarlet fever and it's too late for you to go back, dear � whatovor shall wo do?" The weather for tho past fow days had been very sultry. At this inomont, as the Bun was sotting, tho sky was filled with heavy crimson clouds, and tho air was dense with the smoke of bush fires in tho district. Doepdean, far from perfcotin its sanitary arrangements, was just now. boing visited with an epidemic of fever which was causing great alarm, many peoplo being already down with it. Ruth smiled gently. A new view seemed to be dawning upon licr. Had sbo really come to the very place where her work was waiting for her ? "You can't turn mo away, Martha, dear � not at .this time of night, aud if you did I would not go. Lob mo nurse AVillie? I waut somothing to do. I have been very unhappy, and work will be the best thing to oure me." Aud before Mrs. Ellis could stop lior she had passed, through tho little liouso, every inch of wbioh she knew, had reaohed the children' room, knelt besido Willie's litte cot, and had kissed his fevered check. For AVillie, the little boy next to the baby, was hor favorite. Mrs. Ellis, following as sho could, pulled her feebly away with ono hand, whilo Bho held the crying baby witli the other. The poor woman burst into toars, for she was utterly spent 44 Ob, Miss Ruth, Miss Ruth ! " sho callod out, "you'll catch your death. Come away, dear; do como t " "Never mind me, Martha," Ruth replied in a low voice. 14 I'm not afraid. I never catch any thing, you know. AVillio willsoon get well. Do let mo nnrso bim, for my own sake. Nothing can hurt me now." Somothing in her voice made Mrs. Ellis feel awed, for Ruth, in her weak condition of body and strained stato of mind, folt ns though earthly fear aud earthly interest for horself had complctoly passed away. Thoro was something almost of ecstatic peace and triumph In her soul at tho moment, and aU this looked out from her eyes. In a month from this time Ruth's story was ended. Death, tho most blessed gift that fato could at this juncture) of her lifo have given hor, had set her free. Yet though certainly she died of fever, caught in nursing littlo AVillio Ellis, yet her hold on life before that was so frail that it needed but vory littlo to dissever it altogether. It was on the evening of tho day that the doctor bad said that all danger was over for the , little boy that Ruth said, "Martha, when I got well I am going to take to nursing ; it is the one thing that I feel sure I can do. I will go down to tho hospital in town and get trained. I mnat have work to do. Only you must let me stay with you until I am utrong, and then you imwt help me to do what I want." 4 Yes, dear," said BIrs. Ellis, just to pacify her, but with n sick foreboding at her heart that her dear Bliss Ruth would never bestrong again. And now Mrs. Ellis fondly hoped that Ruth was lying on tho bed whore she had put her to rest. But Ruth, moved by an irresistible de3iro to look upon the fields, had risen and feebly made her way to the door. Hor hand were loosely clasped in front of her ; lior blue cyeB, now larger than ever, had a wandering look in them. Tlio fever waa already affecting hor brain, and working in her blcod. In a little while her post lifo and hor present seemed to mergo in one confused dream. < All those long summers she had passed. How many were thoy? Ruth did hot know, and it did not master now. Tho wondorful dawns sho had watched frciq her window, the sweet dewy mornings, tho rich heat of noon, the slumbrous sweetness oftho afternoon, the cool refreshing evenings, tho lovoly summer nights, summer after summer, anil through them all suoh an achiug aenao of loueliuess, suoh a haunting sense of something to make them complete. . ' ' Then camo the face of Raymond Hamilton. He semed to pass her with a gracious smilo. AYho was ho ; and what did he want? Ruth did nob seem to understand. .Then another face strangely liko her owu seemed to flit before her. . Slio felt a sort of pity for this wan faco, bo liko her own becauso of tlio wistful look in the blue eyes. Rut still it did not seem much to matter. Then tho earth seemed to swell np and meet the clouds, out of which looked un known faces, and hands woro stretched out to her. And Ruth knew no more ; for Mrs. Ellis came and put hor arms around hor, aud led her back to bed, from which she was never to rise again. But why are these cruelty sensitive souls born to face experiences that are too strong for them? There seems to be no real answer to this question. Tho strong may feel contempt for their weakness. The gontle may pity ; tho commonplace mako it a subject for gossip. The philosopher explain it by the law of heredity, and tho grasp of chcumst&nco � but that is all. In Ruth's case none was directly to blame. She bad no knowledge of the world to teach her how to act when facing a now experience. She had no large outlook of life to help hci surmount tho pain of the present by trust in the future. That gllmpBo of hers of the truth, "that by woiking for others we are best enabled
