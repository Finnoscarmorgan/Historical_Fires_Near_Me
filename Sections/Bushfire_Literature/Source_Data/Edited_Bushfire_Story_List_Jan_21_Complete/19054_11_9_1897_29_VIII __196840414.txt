Keith Hope." 

 BY WILLIAM A. OAAIERON, Author of "Idylls of the Dawn." 

 " CHAPTER VITT. 

 During the month that followed KoitK Hope was constantly at Currumbede. For days at first Air. Summers and his sister seemed to think of nothing excent their 

 loss. They went about their work in a dull and listless manner, and did not appear to take any interest in anything. That Mr. Leasing did not perceive what was going on is unlikely; yet, for a lover, he was wonder fully patient and unperturbed. He never got in Keith's way; ho never made love to Ella ljeraelf; in fact, no one seeing him would have guessed that a few weeks previously, he had proposed for-the lady, who was now, evidently being won by another. Little could anyone have guessed that those cold blue eyes wero all the time searching out and noting every little incident, although' they seldom appeared to be on the watch; or that the mall's whole mind, which seemed to be wrapped up in himself, was in reality busily occupied with tiie doings of the people around him. Still waters run ' deep. For Keith and Ella the days were full of subdued happiness. A change had come over Keith's manner. His finer instincts told liim that, with the shadow of death on the house, that was no time for ardent woo ing. His heart hied for the poor girl in her sorrow, and he . treated her as if Bhe had been a favorite sister, with chivalrous defer ence and great gentleness. One evening, at the end of Alarcli, they Were in the garden. They had been silent for some time. As he looked a� the young girl he wns struck by her extreme youtliful- ncss. Her face was tlie same child face that it was two years ago. Very, very, sweet she looked, but so innocently child like that lie hesitated before lie spoke. ' "Ella." "Yes." "I have been thinking lately a great deal about you. Don't you think, dearest, we might be engaged?" Ella pulled a flower, but did not answer. "See, dearest, here is a ring I wish you to wear for ine. When two people care for each other as much as you and I do, I think they are foolish not to take each other for hotter .or worse." He had put a great restraint on himself, and spoke calmly. Had he followed the promptings of his impetuous nature he would linve taken her in his arms and poured out in burning words the love that was in his heart. Ferhaps Ella guessed this, and put his consideration for her to his credit. Iler clear blue eyes looked honestly, straightly and sweetly into bis own, as she answered: "Please, Keith, let us remain as we are a little longer. It is nearly dinner time; let us go back to tlie house." Then, in n lower voice, she said: "You arc very, Teiy good to me." It was the first time she had called him by his Christian name. He took her hand, aiid she did not withdraw it, as side by side they slowly went to the house. They found Mr. Leasing on the verandah; whether or not ho had been Bpying through tho vine trellis did not trouble them. I have mentioned tlint Quigley was the name of the officer in charge of the Nande- wnr police station. He had been many years in tlie force, but had only attained to the rank of senior constable. The townspeople | said lie was "a regular old woman," and that their estimntc of liim may have been correct seemed to be borne out by tlie fact that he was, after all his years of service, only a constable, although in the town he got the courtesy title of sergeant: 'The one aim of his life wns to get and work up a good case, what would entitle liim to pro-- I motion, so that when he retired he would ' have a sergeant's pension. The worthy man was affable and talkative to a degree. About the beginning of April a wonderful change came over him; he was no longer loquacious, 

 but went silently about with pursed lips and an air of exaggerated importance. His chance had come at last; he bad got his great case. I was astonished to learn one morning, while having breakfast at tlie Royal, that Charles Summers's body had been disin terred, aud that the doctors were oven then holding a post mortem on it. That day, at 10 o'clock in the forenoon, tho coroner opened his court, and a jury was impan- lieled. Having nothing to do, I went to the court house. Tlie gentlemen of tho jury had viewed tlie body. 4>ur local doc tor was the first witness called. He had identified tlie body ns that of Charles Sum mers, and had assisted at the post mor- tcm. , , , The coroner continued his examination. . "I understand that you signed a certifi-' cate of death, statiug that the deceased had died from heat apoplexy?" . "Did', you attend him during his last ill ness?" "No " "Dili you see him at all before his death?;; ' "Did yon make any examination of liim after death?" . "No." , , "Tell tho jury exactly you came to sign the certificate?" 'On the 1st day of Alarcli, early in the forenoon, Air. Summers came to me. He said that on .'the previous day . hia son, Charles Summers, - had been working at a bush fire, and had succumbed to the heat, nnd that he wished to bury him that morn ing. Everything pointed to death from heat apoplexy, so I had no hesitation in signing the certificate." "Did you see the body?" "No; it was in the coffin.". . ... "As a matter of fact, you signed this ceiy 

 tiflcate -without having any real proof that the man was oven dead, much less without knowing what the cause of death was." ' "Mr. Summers had described the cause of death." "That will do; you can stand down. Stay, though. You have assisted Dr. Listou m making the post mortem?" Yes." "Aro you and he agreed as to the real cause of death?" : "Yes." "That will do. Call Dr. Joseph Liston. "Dr. Joseph Liston, Dr. Joseph Liston, Dr. Joseph Liston," bawled a policeman, A man about 30 years old, clean shaved and wearing spectacles, stepped into the witness box. After the usual formalities, he pro ceeded to give his evidence. _ "I have examined the body or Charles Summers. All the viscera are too much de composed to make it possible to say what was their state at the time of death. . "Of course," the coroner remarked, just what one would expect after the weather Wo have had for the past month. . "I examined the skull. There is a slight fracture of the right temple bone, at a spot Where the skull is the thinnest.' ' "Is it sufficient to have caused death? "Yes; the fracture would; very likely be accompanied with laceration of the middle meningeal artery." ' � - "And that would cause death? "Yes." . ' - f "How soon would such a wound be likely to prove fatal?" ... . '.'Death might supervene within hnlf.an hour or the patient might survive for two - .or three days." . ' ."'Which would he more likely? ; , .. . would not like to lay down aiw. rule; there have been eases of each kind. I think, on the whole, however, the longer time is the more usual." , ' "Could one recetve such a wound by rail ing to the ground?" - , ' . "I cannot conceive how it would be pos sible to do so." ' "How would such a wound most likely be caused?" ' , , , "By a blow on the head from some blunt instrument." . , "Thank you, doctor, that ill do. 1 Dr. Liston stepped down. . . ' Dr. Jones, the local practitioner, was then asked to re-enter the box. "YoU have heard Dr. Liston's evidence? the coroner asked. "Yes." "Do you agree with him as to the cause of Charles Summers's death?" "Yes." , � "That is all, thnnks. . . Dr. Jones left the- box with an air of re lief. He had evidently got off easier than he ?lie coroner then addressed the jury. . "Gentlemen," he said, "to my mind this Is, in reality, a very simple case, when once we divest it of a few extraneous circum stances. The circumstances I refer to are that all the deceased's family believed that ge died from sunstroke, and that the body was buried and had lain in the ground for more than a month before the police had any suspicion of foul play. You all know the old proverb, however � Murder will out.' Endeavor to. dismiss these things from your minds, which have really nothing to do with the matter, and let us look at the facts of the case, and remember that all the Crown wishes you to decide to-day is what was the cause of death. I believe the authorities have reasons of their own for narrowing JTie question jlown to this issue. Now, what . are these facts? A young mail who lias been working at a fire is found dead in the bush. Some time afterwards a post mortem is held on his body, and the medical gentlemen who make the examina tion find a wound on the head, which they agree in stating is sufficient to have caused death. Had there npt been this wound, it would, of course, be possible that the de ceased had died from lieat apoplexy; but finding that lie had received this fracture of the skull, I cannot sec that anyone can have any reasonable doubt aB to what was the cause of death. Gentlemen, you will now consider your verdict. Do you wish to retire?" The foreman said "Yes," and they went to their room. As soon as they found the door closed on them nearly all began cutting up tobacco and talking.- Of the jurors, one was the editor, proprietor and compositor of the "Nandewar Chronicle"; another, was the principal local storekeeper. These two were fairly educated; the remaining ten were the usual run of hushinen, and one, whom they addressed as Barnabas, was a noted- bush lawyer. This last had been taking copious notes during the hearing of the evi dence,-, and now laid himself out to have a good time in his own way. As most of the Jurors were more or less in debt to the storekeeper, he was naturally foreman. Just then a big red bearded man, a dro ver by vocation, was talking louder than the rest. He was sayiug: "It reminds me of a time I was travelling with 10,000 store wethers in Queensland. There wasn't a skurrick of feed for miles; we had to carry corn for the horses, and Were pushing on all we knew. One night we cut the fence of a station paddock, where there was some dry grass, and put the horses in. The next morning the cove who ran them up told me there was a dead body about half a mile from the camp, and wanted to tell the police about it. 'You anointed fool,' I said; 'do you wnnt us to be here for a week as witnesses and jury men, and have the sheep starve to death?' I lost no time in getting away, I can' tell you. The weather was so hot that the birds were falling dead from the trees, so I guess that corpse was pretty high when they found it. - Here the foreman rapped his knuckles on the table, saying they ought to con sider their verdict, and asked the editor to give his opinion first. That gentleman said � "The. question we are asked to decide looks simple enoUgh, but there is more in the matter than appears on the surface. If we return a verdict that Chnrles Summers died from the effects of a fracture of the skull, the first thing we shall hear is that someone is in gaol for murdering him. The police evidently have a card up their sleeve. Why could, they not let us have the bene fit of the information they possess, to as sist us in coming to a decision?" "I quite agree with you, sir," said a hatchet-faced produce merchant, "they are .too clever by half: for two pins I would moke it, 'Death from visitation of Heaven. Now followed another noisy half hour; never less than "nine jurors speaking at once., . The drover favored the company with a few more reminiscences of flood and field;, and above the kabel Barnabas could - 

 Ibc heard demanding that someone should tell him whereabout in the skull the "cor poral" bono was situated. "Which is the thinnest part of my skull ? " lie insisted. "Don't worry about it," said the editor; "I am sure your skull is equally thick all over;" and the jury, with the exception of Barnabas, laughed. "Oh, well; this won't buy the child a frock," the big drover remarked. "I want to get out of this, and am agreeable to any verdict you gentlemen like. The 'foreman1 seized the golden opportu nity. "Well, gentlemen," he said, "we have all our business to attend to, 'nnd.it pays .none of us to be losing our time here. 1 am inclined myself to fall in with the coroner's view, that the deceased died from the wound on his head." "Bight you are," said the drover; "I'm agreeable. - "Are we all agreed, gentlemen?" asked the foreman. All were, except Barnabas. Then, for one glorious hour, he rend tliem garbled misstatements of the evidence from his notes, pointing out that the doctors had not analysed the stomach for "poison, as they ought to have done. Driven from that position, he argued that the wound might have been caused by a kick from a horse after death, and that the man might have died from sunstroke after all. At last, seeing that it was hopeless to expect to bring the others round to his way of think ing,, and being as anxious to get home as the rest, he suddenly announced that he -would give in to them. Three minutes later the jury came in with the verdict that .the deceased, Charles Summers;- had died from the eficcts of -a fraetureof .the. skull." '. Tlie-cpuft house had been' packed with jicopleall day. The inquest was the one great sensation that Nandewar ever had, and the townspeople availed themselves to the utmost of the welcome break in the dull monotony of their existence. Hour by hour the room grow more and more stuffy, and I had such a headache that I was afraid I would not be able to remain till the case terminated. 1 earnestly hoped that there would prove to be some mistake about the doctor's evidence. I realised what a terrible blow it would be to Mr. Summers and his dnughtcr Ella to find that they had lost Charles through murder. Heaven knows, death in its customary aspect is heart breaking enough, hut when to the sorrow of ordinary bereavement is added the keener anguish and horror of knowing that the loved one lias had liis life ruthlessly robbed from him, while he had in the course of nature many years to live, the mind a second time goes through the poignant suf fering it first experienced. " Very deeply I sympathised with the afiliclcd family, and if was with a sad heart I went home that afternoon, after hearing the jury's ver dict. Believe me, it is with shame that I set down what follows. No one could have, felt more sorry for the Summers family than I did, nor would have done more to serve them in any possible way, and yet this is how I passed the evening of the inquest. At dinner, at the Royal, there was a rather amusing commercial traveller, whose stories were a pleasant change to the thoughts that had occupied my mind all day. So enter taining did I find him that, instead of going home to my dingy little office, I stayed talking- to him long after the dinner table had been cleared. Then I joined him in a drink, . When the glasses were brought in, lie said, "I will show you a simple little thing, and I'll bet you a shilling you can't do it after nie." Then he lifted up liis glass, saying, "Here's to the health of General Boom Boom," or some such rigmarole. He took one sip. Then followed a pantomime of knocking his glass once on the table, tap-- pmg his chest once with his right hand and' once with -his left,, tapping the table and finally his knees in the same manner. Again he lifted bis glass, repeating the for mula, and taking two sips this time; and then he went through the pantomime again, this time repeating eaeli -action twice. A third tjnie he took the glass, taking three sips this time, and went through a panto mime of triple actions; and, finally, witli four sips he emptied the tumbler, and, going with becoming gravity through the actions four times, completed the performance. I thought the thing rather silly than otherwise, but it seemed simple enough, so to pass the time, I staked my shilling, and filling my glass, I took a sip, saying. Here s to the health of General Boom, Boom." All went well till after the three sips, when I made a mistake in the panto mime. I paid my shilling, and, culling for another glass, began again. That time, be-" fore taking llie four sips, I forgot the for mula, "Here's to the health of General Boom Boom." I paid another shilling, and being now determined to do the tiling if I tried all night, I. commenced again. How many times the insane performance of an elderly gentleman drinking the health of an imaginary general, and seriously going through a number of idiotic antics, wns wit nessed that night, I cannot tell. By closing time I was drinking to the health of "Cor- Iioral Jim Jam," and could not have seen a 10I0 in a ladder. I. have only narrated this incident to ex plain how it came about that, not showing out till late the following afternoon, I only learned "then what all the town had known for hours. Keith Hope had been arrested for the murder of Charles Summers, and had been lodged in the Nandewar Gaol tliat morning. I heartily cursed all General Boom-ing commercial travellers, nor did I forget to anathematise my own foolishness, ana hastened to get an order from tho local magistrate to enable me to see my cousin. As soon as he entered the room in the gaol where Sergeant Quigley had left me to wait for liim, he said, Did you ever hear of anything so preposterous in your life, Anthony?" "No," I answered, "never. I am ashamed to tell you, Keith, I am suffering a recovery again. This evening mv head is no use to myself, and it would do of no service to you. In fact, I have only come now by way of friendship. To-morrow I hope I shall be myself again." ."Thank you, old man," ho said. ' "There will be a police court sitting the day after to-morrow; perhaps then we shnll find out what grounds the police have for suspecting me. All I know now is that I am-cliargcu with murdering Charlie Summers.- Good heavens, Anthony, think of it, me of all men in the world, to he accused of doing bo." "Can you think of nothing," I said, "that might, however wrongly, give rise to their suspicions?" ,12iothing whatever," he answered. "I am altogether in the dark." "Well, it's poor comfort," I remarked, "but all we can do is to wait patiently till 

 we hoar the cose in the police court." And after a little more conversation I lelt mm. CHAPTER IX. . Long before the hour at which the pro ceedings in tho police court began the room was thronged. Keith, much against my no vice, had insisted that- I should act as Ins lawyer, and .conduct the case for mm. in vain I pointed out thnt I was not the mail I was once, and that for him to trust such vital interests to my old whisky sodden brain was the height of madness. Ah, many, many times before this trial was over was I to curse the criminal foolishness that had changed tho clearest and acutcst brain in the New. South Wales bar to a broken down machine, which only by . occasional flickers, gave evidence of its original bril liancy of thought! Ah, the man I-was, the man I was, -and the wreck I am now! . Ten o'clock found me seated .in court -at the lawyers' table, and a few minutes after wards the police magistrate took his seat, and Keith Hope wns placed in the dock. After the preliminary' formalities, Dr. Lis ton wns first called. He gave the same evi dence, almost word for word, that he had given at tho inquest. Charles Summers had died from the effects of a fracture of tho skull, caused by some blunt instrument. Sergeant , Quigley . said something to his attendant constable, and the latter produced a short stockwhip handle. "Might this weapon have caused the frac ture? Quigicy asked. A thrill went through the' court as the doctor, after examining it carefully, answered, "Yes." I turned and looked lit'Keith, and noticed that he seemed very excited.' Thatcbmpleted Dr. Liston's evidence, and Dr; "Jones was the next-witness, : He also was of opinion' that the whip handle, now called exhibit A, could have produced the "wound from which Charles Summers died. William Richards was the next name called, and my old friend, Hilly the half- caste, looking at first very frightened, was piloted to the witness box. After the first few questions he became quite collected, and gave his answers intelligently. He de scribed how Mr. Leasing, Master Charlie and himself had set out for a hush fire on the last; day of February. He told how, when they arrived at it, Mr. Lessing and himself had at once commenced to beat it out, while Charles Summers left them to see to a fence. Then, while the whole audience liung breathlessly on his words, he told how, about an hour afterwards, he had heard a cooey, and on going in the direction of the sound came to where Mr. Hope, the prisoner, was standing beside the dead body of Charles Summers. The excite ment was intense when Quigley, producing the whip handle, asked him did he recognise it. "Yes," he answered. "Was it ever. in your possession?" - "Yes, I made it myself out c� a piece of myall. There is a snake with brass eyes, carved round the handle." "Inform his worship liow you came .to .part with it." "I gave it as a present to Mr. Hope." A murmur went through the court, and the constable called, "Silence." "When did you see this whip last?" 'The_ day that blaster Charlie died, I found it on the ground, a little distance from his body." "Whnt did you do with it then?" "Igave it to Mr. Hope." "Did lie say anything to you when you gave.it to him?" "Yes; he said at first he didn't have any whip; but afterwards, when I showed him the' snake on it,, he took it." "You have' known Mr.i Hope for some years," have j'ou not?" Quigley asked. . : Yes." - "Did you see liim a day or two before the fire? "Yes, I saw him the evening before." "'Can you remember anything thnt took place then?" - . "Yes. Master Charlie and I were- doctor ing a_ kangaroo dog that had got hurt, and Mr. Hope came across to us, and said he was sony, but he had shot him, and then lliey had some words." "Can you remember what wns said?" "Master Charles called him a butcher, and Mr. -Hope got 'narked,' and said if it had been anyone else's dog he would linve had the law on him, as well as shooting the dog." Did the deceased make any answer?" Yes. lie said lie would get even with Mr. Hope. . "In fact the two men parted in anger?" Yes, I think so." That' concluded the sergeant's examina tion of the half-caste; and I declined to put any questions to .him. My idea when I had entered tho court that morning had been that there could be no evideucc to warrant Keith's arrest, nnd that the case would probably be dismissed trom the police court. The more, however, I heard of the evidence, the less I liked the position m which Hope stood; and I deter mined to let the Crown state its case fully now, and to reserve our defence till the assizes. While I had been busy with my thoughts, i i jS1?8 bad gone into the witness box, and been dipy sworn. What he told was mostly corroborative of the half-caste's ewdencc. I looked at him very closely, but any .-hopes I might have had of being able ' nf gitf ,la 10us''ts from the expression fnrn Jf? '1Ve?0 InPMteiy baflled. Tho face -was as mask like as ever, and the ;b V01C� . 'n which he answered the questions -which were putting the rone round Keith s neck was the same to which LWmte-ncd witb 'itRlike in the Cumin - bede drawmgroom. Hib account tallied in every particular with the half-caste's, til" he reached the stage at which they found camoout. a new" Piece of evidence askS" 8ay yU hGard a coocr-" Quigley J'XCR- 1 i'?ar<i n number of shouts. Billv and I went m the direction from which the calls came, and found Mr. Hope standing beside the dead body of Charles Summeri? As soon as we enme up Mr. Hope said that deceased had got a sunstroke."

 "I cannot swear positively, but I think it was. your worship." "Did you not tjiiuk it strange that there should be this wound?" -> "Not at the time, your worship. It ap- jicared so very slight that I thought lie might have received it while beiug conveyed home in Nixon's waggon." "You are sure that it was from the ac cused the suggestion came that the deceased had had a sunstroke?" "Yea, your worship, absolutely certain."' As I knew that from sueii people'asiilled the body of the court the jury would he- drawn who would eventually try Keith for Charlie Summers's murder, I studied their faces', carefully | and was alarmed to see what a' bad eflcet this evidence apparently had on them. I could see that nine out of every ton had made up their minds that ho was guilty: and that they believed his try ing to make it appear that Summers had died from sunstroke was a clever ruse to avert suspicion from the crime lie had com mitted. Bad as this part of the evidence was, however, there was worse to follow. Quigley resumed tlio examination, and Lessing deposed to the finding of the whip handle, and to Keith's denying at first that it was his property. "After this what took place?" Quigley asked. "Mr. Hope left us, to go to the station to send a -conveyance to take Charles . Sum mers's body home. He came buck in a short time, and told us that Nixon, the saddler, who was on liis way to Currumbcde in his Waggon, would bo with us directly. "Mr. Hope had said that lie himself would go and tell the elder Mr; Summers What had happened, for fthe sooner the body Was. buried the'bottcr." - ' .'Tie -said Whnt?" the police magistrate cried. As if totally unconscious of the sinis ter meaning hidden in the words. Lessing answered, as smoothly as ever: "Tne'sobner the body was buried the better, your wor ship." 1 went across' to Keith, and asked liim in a whisper if Lessing's statement were correct, nnd I was dumbfounded to get the reply, "Yes, I said something of the sort.' Charlie Summers had been a great favo rite in Nandewar ; and as Keith did not often come to the township, and never as sociated much with the people, ..1 - believe those in the court would have hanged him cheerfully, without- hcuring anything fur ther, when they heard what Lcssiug said. That completed his examination by the Grown, and I did not ask him any ques tions. Nixon, the saddler, was the next witness. His evidence was" of little importance, as he could only tell how he had conveyed the dead body ..from the -paddock 'home to the station. . Quigley himself then went into the box, and stated that a few days before he had gone over the scene of the murder, lie had been accompanied by William Richards, to show him the place. He deposed that there had evidently been a large bush lire sonic time before, as nil tho country, with the ex ception of n few square yards round a largo bibuel tree, had been burned. The grass under the tree had escaped, as it was wiry S -ass-seed, and not enough of it to burn, n going over the ground he had found something hero tho constable in attend ance produced a small black object), which he believed to have been at one time a hat. William Richards lind identified a small plated buckle, which was on the burned hat, as being Bimilnr, to one which the de ceased had worn on a hat band. J The charred mass and buckle were handed up to the bench, and marked exhibit B. Quigley then told how. he had formally arrested Keith Hope for the murder of Charles Summers; and had cautioned him i that any statement he might make would , boused against him as evidence, j "Did he say anything?" the police magis-. trntc asked, as Quigley wns proceeding with I Ins account, without telling if anything had i been said by the prisoner. | "Ho only mnde some insulting remark, I your worship." jJWhnt.diu he say?" . "He said, 'I tliiuk you must have found another of your mnre s nests, Quigley.' " Silence, roared the constable. The townspeople, who knew Quigley well, were greatly tickled at his discomfiture. The sergeant then told how lie had said to the prisoner that lie wanted liis stock winp, and that it would save them both trouble if it were given to him without m'ak- jng( in ill search for it.-'- Hope had answered. Oh, you can nave it, and anything else you want ; and went with liim nnd helped him to find it. .Quigley then identified exhibit A as the whip in question. That completed his evidence, and as I did not cross-examine lnmjie quitted the box. i recalled and Bhown ex- hibit B. identified it as being what lie and Sergeant Quigley had found iii the paddock, near where Charles Summers met his death; and .deposed that the buckle was similar to one winch the dead man had worn, lhat completed the case for the brown. . I spoke a few words to Keith, and stand ing up, said. We reserve our defence, your mft'iHn n- %i10 jtollco .magistrate then com mitted Hone to stand liis trial for T>'i-mu �r P Charles Summers at the I ottinger Assizes in a month's time. - (To be Continued.)
