 THE WINDOOLA. 

 CHAPTER XII.�(Continued.) 

 By "BULLOO." 

 in five minutes there was a great [?]lashing and yelling in the creek, and the Chinamen sprang to their feet; but they were too much afraid to leave the 

 tent and stood chattering, Kong Hang looking out of the door, rifle in band. The commotion continued, and the lea der commanded some of his men to as certain the cause, but they refused, one of them blandly suggesting he could go himself. "It is none of our party," said an other, "and if one of the whites is in trouble so much the better." "Some of you, only two, fire at the creek," was the next order, which was complied with, and two bullets struck the water close to Charlie, who, realis ing the trick bad failed, dived, and was soon at tho boat, where he was rejoined by his companions. "Bad luck to thim," exclaimed Mike, "the masely curs, they were afraid to lave the tint. What'U we do now ? ' "Go out and catch some fish," ex claimed Charlie in disgusted tones, and as it was the easiest tray of obtaining food they went. For several days they kept a watch on the camp, but it was nover left un guarded, Kong and several men remain ing, while the others hub ted for supplies. During this time our friends had lived on fisi, as they would not use fire arms to obtain game, and they did not reli?h 'possums ; but one day they de cided to look for a kangaroo or emu. They did not think any blacks would be In the neighbourhood of two well-armed forces, and started without any mis givings ; even if they met any of the Chinamen they were not afraid of them. The game, however, was shy, and it was not until late in the afternoon they suc ceeded in killing a kangaroo. Remov ing the entrail?, they cut oft the hind quarter? and returned to the camp, when going to the beach for a bathe they discovered the boat was gone. Their discomfiture, however, was a source of huge satisfaction to the Chinamen, for the blacks bad passed with the boat in sight of their camp, and they hoped the white party had bee-a killed. They knew the schooner would soon arrive to take them away, and although they had failed to recover the god they had several thousand pounds worth of gold. Two days passed, and as Kong had seen nothing of our fricads bo concluded they were dead, and arranged a hunting party to kill some large game and smoke it an a treat for their countrymen when they arrived, aud the whole party left the camp. 

 CHAPTER XIII.�The Windoola. Although dreadfully disappointed at los ing the boat, and chagrined at their carelessness in leaving it unprotected, they did not despair of recovering both It and the treasure. Billy was of the opinion the blacks would not go any great distance away, bo they deter mined to keep a watch on the Chinese camp in the hope of catching them off their guard and recovering the gold. On the day of the proposed hunt Billy watched the camp while the others fished at the mouth of a small creek not far away. He could hardly credit his senses when he saw the Chinamen going off in a tody, nnd hurried away to his mates. They wcro equally astonished, and at first feared a trap, but Billy scouted round, reporting there was no doubt about the fact. They lost no time <n Becttring the box, which they carried between them two at a time, and hav ing reached the small creek sunk it in the water. "Now for the boat," cried Mike. "Be gorra, our luce's in agin, no it is." The ra*e of the Chinamen when they returned and discovered their loss may te more ensly imagined than described. Kong Mang was furious, knocking the men about until one or two handled thtir knives in . a suggestive manner, and he retired sullenly to his tent. His exasperation was increased shortly after by one of his men announcing, a, sail was in eight, which was probably the expected schooner Windoola. Their hunting trip had been moderately suc cessful, resulting in a bag consisting of three kangaroos, one emu, nnd four wal labies, but if anything it Intensified his chagrin, for his .comrades on the Bhip would consider the fresh meat a poor substitute for the gold. Night fell before, the vessel was near enough for them to be sure of her identity, but they had little doubt nbout it, and kept a fire burning all night as an. easy guide to Lhcir loca tion. At daybreak she lay r.t auchor half a mile away, when a boat contain ing the captnin and two others came ashore. The new comers perceived some thing was amiss, and were soon placed in possession of the facts. Captain Komeera was a Japanese of the usual short, well proportioned build of his countrymen, and evidently com posed of different material to the China- V^men. He listened attentively to Kong 

 Mang's statement, asked a few ques tions and said : "We mu?t go after those wbitemen, and if we catch them we'll soon find out where they've hidden the cold." "But they have friend? who expect their return, and if we subject them to tor ture, or kill them, they will soon set the Government in motion." "Pshaw i A handful of rice for their Government ! By the time their friends find out they are dead we shall be halt way to Hongkong, and who will JtnoW we have had anything to do with it ? We'll torture them, and if that is not sufficient we'll kill them one by one. I'll get half a dozen men from the ship, and with yours we'll hunt them down. They won't leave without their boat, and should not be hard to find, as they must keep to the coast or the creeks to find her." After breakfast he returned to the schooner, bringing back eight well-armed Chinamen, wh�n, their tools and cases of tinned food having been placed in the tent it was left standing, and the whole party, consisting of twenty-one, started along the coast to the North, which was the direction the blacks had taken with the boat. Meanwhile Oharlit, and Billy, keeping a watch on their camp, saw the arrival of the addition to the Chinese force, cc well as their departure up the coast. ,i 

 The design of the enemy was appa rent, and our friends, having secured a further supply of ammunition from the cache, raked the ashes over it, and sprinkled them with water so skilfully that the surface did not appear to have been disturbed. They then got on the tracks of the enemy, whom they fol lowed at a safe distance. "Begorra, it's great, so it is," ex claimed Mike. "They think we're look ing for the naygurs and the boat, while we're lavin' the earch to thitn. I hope they'll foinil thlm soon." "I hope bo," said Charlie ; "but I expect we won't got the. boat back without a fight for her." "Divil a care I care. I'm not much givin' to blowin' mesilf, bnt if I rouldn't wallop half thitn Chinamen single-handed me name's not Mike M'Grath." The Chinamen camped for two hours at noon, our friends following suit, and while they wore resting Charlie suddenly exclaimed : "How many men wore left on the schooner, Mike�did you notice ?" "Only two as far as I could see. Why?" "If we could get off to her we could overpower thrm, and take the schooner." "Piracy on the high seas !" interject ed Jasper with a laugh. "Just so," replied Charlie gravely. "I didn't think of that"; but bright ening up h? continued : "They attacked us first, and as we have every reason to believe they're after iis now we art K^iit* 

 justified in retaliating upon them. In fact it may be the only way of saving our lives�eh, Mike ?" "Bedad, ye're roigbt, as ye always are. We'll get oft" to her alright if we have to swim for it." "Plenty Bharks," remarked Billy. "Niver moind the sharrks ; they moighta't be an�y worse than the Chows and the naygurs." "It will be worth trying," remarked Charlie. "If the Chinkies recover the boat they'll come back to their camp, and they're sure to keep going until they do, for they know we can't leave without it. Come on, boys, and we'll think out a plan to capture the schooner." It was after dark when they reached the Chinamen's deserted enmp, and while they consumed their evening meal they gazed at the riding lights of the schooner. Several schemes were devised for reach ing the vessel, but nothing was deckled upon. Had it not been for fear of sharks they could have swum off, for they were all fine swimmers ; but dread of being torn by the sea monsters proved on effectual bar. A canoe was suggested, hot the idea was rejected because it would take too long to make. Then a raft was pro posed, but they thought they would not be able to take it alongside silently, so that they would probably be shot by the men in charge of the ship. 

 "We'll Bleep over it," said Charlie, and they retired to rest, though the speaker lay awake for several hours turning the matter over in his mind. "I think we shall have to make a dugout," 'he said in the morning. "We can Bafely reckon on the Chinamen be ing away three or four days, and that should give us sufficient time. We can look out. for a partly burnt tree and chop out the rest. We have the toma hawk, and there are two axes in the Chinamen'b tent." As the others had arrived at very much the same opinion there was very little discussion, end after breakfast they took the tools and set out to find a tree. They had not shown themselves on the shore after daybreak, co the ship's guard were ignorant of their being in the neighbourhood. They were fortunate, for they soon found a tall tree that, hav ing a pipe, had been gutted by bush fire, and in a short time it had been felled and cut into a thirty-feet log. Two difficulties still lay before them� to convey the log to the shore, and to make the ends water-tight. The former merely required a, considerable amount of exertion, but the latter was a more difficult problem, and while Billy and Jasper hunted for food their mates sat down to think it out. At length Charlie said : "I have it ; we'll break up some of those boxes in the tent, and with the board and pieces of the lull's hide we'll make both bows and stern." "The very May," replied Mike ; "it's (27) 

 the very thing the doctor oidercd, so it is." "We must break them up with as little noise as possible to-night, and <)o the work here, so that the snip won't hear us." After dark sufficient cases were opened, and some strips of the bull's hide hav ing been procured they placed the latter in the creek to soak. In the morning it was sufficiently Boft for their purpose, and they returned to the log bearing hide, boards, and nails ex tracted from the boxes. It was not an easy matter to make the ends at til watertight, and it was so late in the afternoon when the job was completed that they waited until dark, when, with great labour, the canoe was rolled down to the shore, the making of the paddles being left for another day. The latter were construct ed of saplings and pieces of board, four in all, and they were prepared for the venture. "Put in a good supper, me bhoys," exclaimed Mike. "There's nothin' like a good feed before a foigfat, and the two Chows on the schooner will give us plinty to do if they solght us before we get on board." The night was not very clear, for al though the sky was not hidden by clouds a slight haze dimmed the stars, rendering their schemes more easy of accomplishment. The tide was rising, and although not strong assisted them, so that they could use their paddles lightly, and the schooner was approached silently. A rope's end hanging down over the quar ter enabled them to make the canoe fast, when Mike, who assumed the lead ership, and Charlie climbed on board ; the others handing up the firearms fol lowed. 

 For some minutes they crouched mo tionless in the shadow of th� bulwarks, their sight and hearing strained to the utmost tension, for they Binpeeted the silence might be a trap. But a move had to be made, and Mike, signing to Billy to scout along one^^d^uol the ship, proceeded in fjdtfi'VpiwTlS?fctfe them with the msjf g?pafflfeandnNMHt volver. Both tbJgfcfiTameo Xelk<H*�J�W*l one on either mavfot towMlwKk l #?� 1 shade of the biMfcAs,'td?rtfere notjflfcjJ clipping the Bailor's^|^|j�y y a>i s �B9f^ter fired from his waist, kflllng~hls oppo nent with a ball through the heart. The second guard, being roused from a deep sleep by the reports, sprang to his feet, when, perceiving Billy coming at him with uprated spear he uttered a fright ened yell, and springing ovevtbard struck put for the shore. The boys ran for ward at the shots, and were dcligtrted to find their companions were unhurt. "If that Chow had had any slnse he'd ha' gone overboard too," remarked Mike, touching the corpse with his foot. "Did you give him time ?" inquired Jasper. "Who fired first, you or he ?" "That'B what I say�he ought to have gone overboard, and then he wouldn't be lyin' here to feed the sbarrks." "Never mind him," said Charlie ; "let's take the ship's boat and bring the things on board. The sooner we get away the better. If Kong Mnng has had luck and caught the blacks they may b� back with our boat before morning." The boat was lying at the stern, and casting their canoe adrift they entered the former, and pulled for the shore, in tending to lift the idol with their other goods, then recover the gold, and return as speedily as possible, so we will leave them for the present, and follow the movements of the Chinese party. On the second day they were walking quite carelessly, with Captain Komeera and Kong Mang in the lead, who were discussing general matters while keeping a casual eye on the sea for the boat, when Komeera suddenly grasped his companion by the ana as a number of spears fell amongst the party, wound in* three severely. "Each man take a tree," cried the captain, discharging his magazine rifle rapidly at the point whence the spears had come. The Chinam.'.n, some of whom wero very nervous, needed no second command to get under cover, and crouched behind trees and bushes. There was no move on either side for a few minutes, when Komeera saw a black and fired, killing him. Wild yelh. arose from the blacks, followed by a shriek from one of the sailors, who sprang from behind his "bush transfixed by a spear. Presently two more were speared, and Komeera saw steps must he taken to dislodge their assailants. "Stand ready to charge inland," he cried ; "but first we will fire a volley. I'll give the word and we'll clear these vermin out of the way. Ready, fire, charge !" The movement was executed, but ra ther half-heartedly, for some of the sailors lagged behind, and Kong Mang did not arrive at all, remaining behind a thick bush. The charge following thr volley had ap parently driven the blatks away, for none were seen, and the party moved on, leaving their dead and dying behind. They were at a great disadvantage in the thick timber, and pushed on hoping to meet clearer country. 

 Komeera had not mustered his men, and had gone a hundred yards when it occurred to him to do so, and he fomid Kong was absent. Returning with half a dozen men, he found the bis China man with four spears sticking in bis body. He was quite dead, and bad evi dently been killed while crouching behind the bush. "Bring his rifle and bandolier, one of you," commanded the captain. "We must leave his body for the present, and get out of thi? hole as soon as possible." He bad lost a third of his party, and with the exception of three or four could not rely upon them to evince much cour age. Personally he was as brave as � lion, and a few of the sailors who had been with him for some years could be depended upon to fight to the last ; and although surprised at the daring of the blacks in attacking such a well-armed party he hoped to beat them off, and by securing the boat prevent the whites from escaping with the treasure. Firing occasional shots into the tim ber, they hurried on until reaching- an open flat they halted. Night was close lit hand, so the leader decided to camp, and fires were lighted to. drive off the myriad mosquitoes, and the evening meal prepared. At dark guards were posted, who were relieved every four hours, and the night passed without disturbance, but one of the guards did not come in for break fast, and his body wus discovered with a spear through its heart. Komeera "^m pussled how to act. He did not know whether the attacking party were in pos session of the boat or not ; while for all he knew those who had the boat might have doubled back in the night. There had been no sign of the boat on the sea, but it might have been taken up a ejeek. Finally he decided to go on for another day, and if the boat was not discovered Ite would return to the tent. The tra velling was bad, for mangrove swamps and gutters were met with, compelling them to make considerable detours to avoid them ; mosquitoes were in my. riads, and whenever they impatiently endeavoured to take a short cut through' a gutter they sank over their knees ;so ,it is not to be surprised that at night -fall, having met with no sign of the Iboat or the savages, they were exhaust led and dispirited, Komeera alone show ing no sign of diminishing energy. He was no nearer a solution of the puszle though, and the following morning they turned on their tracks, heading for the tent. On reaching the spot, where Kong Mtrag had been killed they found his body as they had left it. (To be Continued.)
