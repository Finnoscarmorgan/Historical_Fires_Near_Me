 MEMORY'S WILD RIDE. 

 (By Chloe Tamara.) . '': . 

 CHAPTER IL - ?. 

 Meanwhile Nino had helped her mother.into an old faded dressing gown, and carrying the baby, on one arm and dragging the cradle with another they emtered the haven of refuge. 

 Then Memory kissed ithem good-bye,- and, wiUh a parting injunction not to let Jack wander be yond ithe creek banks, ran swiftly up 'the hill. 

 To saddle Demon was the work of a moment, then, with a backward glance .to Nln and Jack toiling to and from .the house. Memory waved a final adieu and disappeared through the trees. The road, or rather track, nearest the homestead was worn almost smooluh; buit further on in the forest it grew tortuous and stony, with here and there a tangled creeper, providing pitfalls for un wary feet. But Demon galloped on, with un abatlng speed-on, and on, swerving round corners, leaping fallen trees;1 while Memory clung like a 

 limpet to her saddle'. : As she rode, her plans . formed rapidly in her brain, and memory carried her back to another bush fire she had seen. Again she saw the cruel flames, creeping insinuatingly along the grass, and leaving a blackened, ruined country behind-the cottage wrapped in its fiery . mantle, and then a heap of ashes; the weeping mo� 

 ther, the sad-faced father, and homeless children, watching, powerless! The picture was engraven on her heart, never to be effaced ; now the tragedy 

 seemed likely to be enacted again, and this, time : they would be the sufferers. ' 

 She urged her horse forward to his utmost speed. 

 "God help me to be in time!" she prayed. "Good . Demon, onward, old horse;" and the pathway rcng with the galloping hoofs. The deathly silence of the forest was awful; a portentous feeling " bf something about to happen seemed to pervade the air, and even the leaves' slight' rustling seemed fraught with meaning. 

 Then Memory saw it--the little red flame that shot along so rapidly-the outsider, as it were, of 

 the mighty wall of fire advancing from behind. How the graso withered before its embrace! How it ran up the stems of the trees and vanished in air, leaving them a blackened ruin, while lt laughed a little further on! 

 The little flame ran across Memory's path, the grass blazed up, and then both horse and rider seemed surrounded by a blinding wall of fire and smoke. Demon snorted and reared madly; the girl saw the glare as in a dream, her head bowed forward to the saddle pommel, and the reins slip� ped from her nerveless fingers. . But brave Demon carried her safely through. 

 With scorched hands and singed hair she was be ing carried towards the rock-clad hill that mark ed her journey's end. 

 "Dear old Demon," she murmured, patting his foaming neck. Then she drew rein, and for one little minute gazed backwards. 

 A dreary vista of blackened trees stretched be fore her, lifting, leafless arms to a red and sullen sky; and the fire-wall rolled ever on. : 

 Down on the Wrangerton verandah the house hold was gathered, anxiously watching the column of . smoke, while the men stood about in little knots, discussing the probable origin of the fire, and the amount of damage likely to ensue. 

 Then, they looked towards the hills, down which someone was riding recklessly, and a murmur of surprise arose. They saw a white-faced girl, with singed hair, and clothes torn almost to ribbons, and the horse she rode was a mass of lathery foam, 

 with distended eye, and quivering nostrils. Before, they had time* to speak, Memory had ridden-up-to the steps, and, slipping from her sad dle, she threw her arms round Demon's neck, and kissed him impulsively. 

 "He saved my life,", she said, simply. 

 "Memory, my dear, my dear, wh�t is' the mat ter?", cried Mrs.!Murray, running forward; whii� . the others crowded round. Then 'Memory told her tale, and soon Mr. Murray and his men were* galloping away, to battle with the flames by a path that was out of the line. of. fire.- Memory rested a while, and then began her homeward ride, for the suspense was dreadful. The fire was advancing at such" a rate that it gave them but scant time to stop it before it reached the cottage. For ought she knew, it might be burn ing now, and she dreaded the thought of what harm it might dp their mother, weakened as she 

 was by a long Illness. She started westward - atan easy canter,-for. Demon was weary as well as his rider; but she soon had to hasten again, 

 for the smoke cloud, was rolling towards her, and ? she grew afraid that her path would be cut off. At last she. reached the hill above the farm, and saw a-.wonderful, beautiful scene be neath her. The cottage was enveloped in a cloud of smoke,, through which now aud then the davit 

 figures of men could be seen beating fiercely at. the advancing wall of flame, i All around the fields were black and smoking-; but the house was saved. Memory galloped up] the wide, sandy bed of the creek, and unsaddling Demon let him go where he would. Then she� began an account of her* ride to the three anxious ones, still sit ting under the trees, with most of their goods piled round them. When she had finished a little; silence fell on the group, broken by a ring ing cheer from the men; and the mother's eyes 

 were full of tears. '
