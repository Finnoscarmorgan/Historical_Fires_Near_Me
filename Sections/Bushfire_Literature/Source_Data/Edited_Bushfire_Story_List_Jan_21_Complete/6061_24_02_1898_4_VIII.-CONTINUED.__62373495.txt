 CILlATER VIII.-Co-rrmrn, 'Tut, tut I' said John Horton. 'You forget, little one, that we are not now in Manilla, Rogues cannot do as they please here.' However, perhaps, Ir Horton was not quite correct. At any rate, he could not have contemplated the arrival of a condition of affairs when rogues did do pretty well what they liked, to the grevious loss and injury of honest folk. Mir Sparkle was a guest at dinner that day, and John Horton took occa sion to announce that he and his ward were to leave for the station' in the course of the week. He paid particu lar attention to the expression of MIr Sparkle's ingenuous visage when he ithus spoke, and was not surprised though lie was very indignant to ob serve that Air Sparkle was greatly affected by the news. However. he quickly rallied, and addressing Olive, expressed his hope that her absence from town would not be for long. 'For really-and I hope you will receive my words as honest truth-you have created a sensation, Miss Verneis. I hear you spoken of with admiration everywhere. It will be cruel-a social outrage-egad! ifyou bring yourself into the bush. Oh, dear me-a positive disaster'-and Mr Sparkle shook his head and looked very grieved indeed. Olive burnt out laughing. ' They tell me, Mr Sparkle,' she said, 'that in the bush they have a bird they call a jackass.' Mr Sparkle bowed. ' Of the king fisher tribe,' he said. 'A most comical tellow- the laughing jackass.' ' Well, Mr Sparkle,' went on Olive, with a merry glance at her guardian, 'I shall not need reminders of those who mourn my absence, when I see and heal this bird, eh? Ah ! then I shall weep for those who mourn for me.' ' Gna!' ejaculated Mr Sparkle. 'You must forgive me, Olive,' ob served Mrs Horton, 'if I say that I hardly consider that a delicate, lady like, or grateful remark. The acknow ledgement by society of-er-your at tractive qualities hardly deserves to be thus flonted.' 'Faith ! I don't know,' interjected John Horton. 'So far as I can see, the girl's comparison is a just one but all to the credit of the bird, which is a very intelligent creature-and I can't say as much for the imbeciles I see knocking about, sucking theircane handles and staring young women out of countenance. However, mother, it does not matter,' he went on. " My ward, it seenms, is not cut out for fashil,nable life. She thinks so, any way. Perhaps she'll get tired of a bush life, and be glad to get back to your flimsy existence. We shall see, at any rate.' IHere M?rs Horton, without further speech, arose and left the gentlemen to their wine. Mr Sparkle flew to open the door. As Olive passed behind John Horton's chair she bent down and wiispered; 'Thank you, guardian. I love you buttcr every day,' and passed on with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes. 'A quick wit, Mr Horton,' said Mr Slpalkle as he reseated himself. ' The panish creoles are very vivacious when once they get away from the formali ties. ' You have some knowledge then of their race? You have probably visited Manilla?' 'Oh, dear, yes. Albeit, that is, a passing visit.' And Ir Sparkle drank off his wine. A quick suspicion came to him that perchance Olive had told the story of her capture when a child, and had perhaps hinted that Mr Sparkle looked very like one who participated in that scoundrelly busi ness. Suspicion ever haunis theguilty mind, and this gentlemrian had seen and noted everytbing is the demeanour of Olive Verners towards himself to raise the idea that perhaps the girl had identified him. Besides, he had caught Carlotta's fierce black eyes fixed upon him with such hatred expressed in them that he could not but suspect the Malay knew and feared him. He did not stay long that evening. When he left, he took a cab and drove at speed to the cottage where Philip 'erners lived. Verners was there, as usual, playing eucihre with Snapper. S\\Well,' said Philip, as he read in Mr Sparkle's face ill news, ' what now? ILave you had the cheek to propose? And of course the girl scorned you.' 'Oh, dry up,' cried AMr Sparkle, irrltably. 'The girl's guardian intends to carry her off to his station. They !cave the day alter to-morrow. There's a go. Just as things were getting on I , smoothly.' 'Then it is time,' said Verners, with an oath, 'that I should interfere. Never shake that ugly head of yours, S::ap,'er. I say yes. Ihave a claim ise claim of a brother. tWhat! shall it ie said that a blood relation has no ba':er dciim over this girl and her for tun- than a stranger, Not so.' 'Oh, dear!

 prtssions of that person's past assocla tions with her brother in the plot against her life or liberty at Manilla. The honest squatter's brow was black under his sense of indignation, so that it was a malapropos movement for the introduction of Philip Verners upon the scene. But so it came about. Mr Bufiles, with a full sense of the re sponsibility of the moment, announced Mr Philip Verners, and ushered that gentleman into the room, without first informing Mr Horton of his arrival. John Horton glanced at his ward, She had grown very pale, and as though under some spasm of weak ness, grasped the table against which she stood. Philip Verners looked long and fixedly at his sister, What did he think of? Did he recall the cruel outrage of which he was the author, and she the victim ? That some such memory inspired him was plain enough, since he looked upon the girl with a lingering regard which spoke eloauently of his feelings. ' This lady,' said he to John Horton, 'is my sister.' John Horton, pale and excited, nodded his head. ' I need some better proof than your own statement. Miss Verners is my ward.' 'As to proof,' cried Philip Verners, 'it is easily supplied, Indeed, I think Olive will supply it herself. Am I not your brother, Olive?' The girl, whose face was deadly pale, glanced at her guardian. ' I have told you,' she said, in that voice of deprecation which we use under a consciousness of disgrace, 'that I had a brother. I deemed him dead. I would that he were.' SAlh!' said Philip Verners, 'you are not the first in whom such a wish has been excited. But enough. Mr Horton, I have called to-day to submit a formal claim. This young lady is my sister. I understand that sthe is possessed of a certain fortune. I claim a right, as her brother, to invest that fortuite in her interest.' 'Or yours ?' cried John Horton, with a grim smile. Philip Verners was in no way dis concerted. 'You are right,' said he. ' },y in terest is of course identified with my sister's. In one word, I claim that the girl be given up to me, and that all property belonging to her be accounted for.' As he spoke he glanced at Olive, who had remained in the room. She was still very pale, but her eyes were set together with a determined expres sion that was ominous. SGive him all,' she cried in a despairing voice; 'let him have the money, but Mr Horton-John-omy brother--save me from him.' As she spoke, Philip Verners turned his eyes upon her, It is possible that some tender memory inspired him as he did so. 'Why do you so hate me?' he asked, taking her hand. She snatched it away, as she ex claimed: 'Save me from this man,' and as she spoke she turned her head to John Horton. Honest, manly John Horton I The clear light of truth and honesty was reflected in the eyes which looked upon Philip Verners; and Philip Verners, with the natural dislike of his class to truth and honesty, felt very uneasy under its influence. And Olive noted this with satisfac tion and pride, too, in the knowledge that she had a protection who would never fail her. In truth, the girl, ac customed to the evils and treacheries of Spanish manners and methods, had feared that this claim of which her wretched brother spoke could not be resisted. It was in that fear that she had cried out to her guardian to give her fortune to the man, but to save her from harm. Meanwhile Mr Philip Verners felt by no means comfortable. He had not come prepared for argument. IIe had relied upon an arrogant demand. Indeed, he was a semi-savage, wholly ignorant of the rights which the laws of civilized communities afford under circumstances where they are invoked. But he felt now, under the scorn of John Horton's scrutineering, that lie had better perhaps have listened to Mr Snapper's expostulations. But it was too late to retreat, and so he put a bold front tlpon what was in fact a quailing spirit. ' You are perhaps aware,' he said haughtily, ' that my claim is one which is acknowledged not only by law, but by nature. I am this girl's brother her next of kin--her natural protector and giuardian.' 'Ah!' said Horton; 'but you see I have been instructed to defend my ward from-hler brother-a robber, a would-be murderer, an outlaw, around whose neck the noose will yet hang.' At these words the face of Philip Verntcrs grew lghastly, With difficulty lie moistened his pallid lips with his lan 'te. 'Ah !' he cried, 'you would then threatetn .N: You do not know me. C.anti, ! far less than you have said I ihave driven a knife heneathl a man's ribs. I -,-arc! I am dangerous. Olive, iiliten. ,,u shall comie to sme-tome, iour brottier, sn ofi your fathter.

IHcre he glanced at Olive, who, standin, apart with clasped hands, re g:arded slits with admtiration and grati tude. The calm dignity with which ter guardiasl bore Ihimsself exhibited to ier eager percepltion a new and noble llhase of hii character.

 of the tie between her and the humbled wretch upon the sofa, who now spoke: 'You deem me your enemy,' he said in tones of smothered rage. ' You are right, Olive. You should know me-and so may dread me. As for you, sir,' lie added, turning to John Horton, who-his square shoulders set against the mantelpiece-regarded him attentively, 'I shall not forget you. You are one of those persons who are gifted with much common sense. Look to it that it saves you from my tallaedcion rtayo st/ed los infernos,' and with this amiable benediction Philip Verners strode from the room, ' I'll not do any discredit to this gentleman's opinion of my common sensh eh, Olive? Well, he is an insolent fellow, and were I as hot blooded as some, I might have thrown him from the window, Never look scared, Olive,' he continued gaily; ' these fellows who are so ready with their threats are rarely as ready with their deed. At any rate, I see nothing to fear.' 'I do not know,' she answered wistfully regarding him. 'He is a bold, bad man This much I know from Carlotta and my own memory. I fear his passion, his hate,' and she crept ruefully up to John Horton's side, and looked up in his face with eyes that told that her fears were not for herself. John Horton felt a strange thrill-at once of pain and pleasure-as he looted down from his lofty height upon the sweet young girl who clung to him as the one able to protect and aid her; and John Horton, under his breath, swore a deep oath that such aid and protection should never be wanting from him. Stooping, he kissed the girl upon her cheek and bade her keep good heart. 'We leave to-morrow for Horton Vale, little lady,' he cried. 'There, you will readily forget this unpleasant matter,' and, with a cheery nod, he left the room. \\Vhat made Olive look after him so eagerly, with parted lips and heaving bosom ? What kept the quick flush on her cheek, where he had pressed his lips? If we can little guess, still less could Olive, who only knew that her heart beat with a wild yet pleasing energy, and that a quick yet undefined sweet hope had shed its light upon her soul. Oh, mystery of our being, who shall gauge its power, who confine its strength? As Olive turned away with lingering steps into the conservatory, she heard Mr Sparkle bidding the ladles good day. He had heard of Philip Ver ners's presence, and had seen that gentleman leave tile house with an ominous scroul on his face, and he was naturally eager to learn what had oc curred. As he passed from the gar den he looked up and saw Olive, when lie bowed gaily.' ' Hang the fellow,' he muttered, ' he will spoil all by his rashness. If he did but know how thoroughly in earnest I am, I think he'd love to thwart me from sheer devilry. Well, we shall see whether bluster or wit gains the day. Meanwhile, I foresee the greatest obstacle in this Mr John Horton. The girl is impassable, and I much mistake if she does not already regard this broad-shouldered squatter with some tenderness,' and as this re flection occurred to Mr Sparkle, he struck the heel of his boot on the pave ment, and ground his teeth together with genuine anger. "Tis always the way,' he muttered. 'These fellows always win the day by sheer common sense. Well, I have some on my side, added to which I have few scruples, and my circum stances are so desperate that I am con. tent to take the risk. And so, my pretty Olive, your chance of becoming Mrs Sparkle is a very good one.' CHAPTER X. TIHE PLOT TIIICKENS, As may be judged, John Horton now took prompt steps to remove his ward to the station. Her feverish eager. ness to be taken from town and the vicinity of one who, albeit her brother, she naturally regarded as her worst enemy, was welcome to him, He came to look upon himself in a some what chivalrous light, as one to whom this young creature turned for protec tion, as to the only being who was able or willing to accord it; and honest John Horton, who had come to love the girl with singular tenderness, girded his moral nature, and swore that no care should be wanting on his part to preserve her from the persecution and pursuit with which she was threatened. Accompanied by Edith and Car lotta, Olive and hIer guardian left town for the station, the day following the stormy scene I Ihave described. There was no very great protestation of regret on Mrs Horton's side; none whatever on that of Miss Horton. Indeed, the latter young lady scarcely conceded her satisfaction. Olive's beauty was a thorn in her side, and shIe had too much sense to hide from herself that she was a rival whose competition was by no means to be lightly regarded. Moreover, she had early perceived that .Mr Sparkle was fascinated by the girl. That gentleman, indeed, was led to his late no less by the loveliness of the young creature whom hIe had marked a victim, but by the stimalant which lher decided expulsion of his advances excited within him. Miss Horton having noted this, and Miss Horton having been rather taken by Mr Sparkle's gay chatter and handsome face, the re moral of thie lady he sought, became doubly desirable to her. And so, as the carriage conveying the party drove through the gates, she smiled with satisfaction, and with a secret hope that one person of the three would never cross her path again.
