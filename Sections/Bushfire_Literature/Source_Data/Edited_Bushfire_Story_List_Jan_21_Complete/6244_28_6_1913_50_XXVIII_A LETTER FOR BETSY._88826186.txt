The. convict Stokes had a grudge against him. The .?outcome of it was that Sir James Bennett reg^dned his life, piitt?e, and pro- . perty; and nis assailant was. shot offihand find buried- under the tree where he' had. left his victim to die a ling^aang death, iiush firea had . broken out to the cast, so Salathiel brought, the barrister to - the glen for' a few days to rest, and, muj-. uap/ to .form a better o^inipn of the outlaw to whom be owed his life.

Moore and his ' din guked troopers in the district, ? -msl one of his men bad found oat that a con stable had warned a settler to clear out, as there was likely to be a big forest fine in a few' days in the ranges. It was not difficult for Salathiel to surmise that the constable's foreknow ledee - of the fire', cajrie - to him eeiniom xaally, and 4iat it was intended by theso means to drive him and bis men but oi their mountain stronghold. He resolvjd that, by hook or. by crook, Sir njamt^ should accompany Mm to J;he glen, nnti the attempt to burn him out. had proved unsuccessful.

There were many spell-bound watchers tLat night besides . Jack and Sir Jaincs, waiting for the flames to overleap, the .intervening space ami sweep down upun itlie glen in billows of destruction. . . ? 'I'Jl take a glass of whisky-and-water, .

Sakthiel brought the whisky, and Sir ♦Tames rose from his seat and gulped it . dowrn. Just then, to the north-east, a rocket rose in the *ky, high above the , conflagration. 'Did you sec that?' ejaculated Sala thiel. his face hot with passion. 'Wait,' said the cautious lawyer, 'it may not have been a signal at all.;' but lie shuddered cveu as he spoke. 'It's that or nothing,' replied, Sala thiel. 'In an hour the fbes to south and cast will reach the gten. Now is the exact time to fire the western forest. if they wish to destroy every living crea ture here.' For ten, more minutes they waited, breathless with excitement and suspense, and then a strange thing happened. It was aa though a great -sword of flams liad been unsheathed fretn the side of Oxley's Peak, and pointed heavenward in flic midst of the western woods. 'It'll be here in an hour if this gale continues,' «aid Salathiel. 'Oh, you fiend!' he exclaimed suddenly, shaking his first with passion at the west. 'You fiend of Hell! you murderer! And to thank that you have the destinies of human beings in your hands. And that . the Almighty permits it! And we have women and children in the glen, whom this pattern police inspector has de . 3ibera&?Iy planned to roast alive!' 'Good Heaven, man! he can't know that there are women and children 3iere,' said Sir James with a shudder. 'He knows more than you imagine,' replied Salathiel; 'but he will h«:ar more to-night than he bargains for.' He blew a silver whistle, and imme .'. jdiately two men appeared and saluted respectfully. 'Bide up the glen,' he said, 'awd hurry all the people to the southern caves. Teil the men to get plenty of water and hang wet blankets at each entrance. That new fire in the west will be here in an hour. 'Heve you got all the horses and pattle under cover, and the sheep? *'That'« right! Tlie buildings and crops-: can't be saved; it's a question of life now, and with all this', dry limber in the glen even the caves may not save ?as.:' Salathiel turned again to Sir Jaraeg, xho was scanning the west through a pair of field-glasses. 'I would not have; .ijeliewd it,' ho exclaimed; ''it's already a sea of fire. Why, the trees arc burn , ing to tlioir topmost branches.' ? 'Yes,' said Salathiel calmly, 'Moore .will Jrave light enough to-night to b~; by— those trees am ninny of them 250 ft. high. They'll have burning brands dropping everywhere in thousands be tween here and Patrick's Plains. Thu too], herll fire half the nortiiurn district ticforc he has done! But excuse nn- iot a few minutes, x have som« matters to atti'ii'l to.' lie hurried round among the men, calm and dignified, giving orders and wise coim ? ,sels. He s-iw that the sentinels had beon called into shelter— the fires were suilioiein cuard now. He spoke kindly and cheer fully to women and children, and made sure that JTleetfoot was safe in the far recesses of a cave, and Ned Feuton and Dandy Snow had not returned, but they were experienced ' budimen, and Salathiel expressed his be lief that they would be safe. Tlien ho called up at the cave occupied by Acuoa and Dob, arid helped them to put every thing in a far corner, covering the furni ture with ruRS'. . 'They may o?cap-?,' hi; said; 'but if they are burnt we Bhall not want them, for we filial! not be alive. Now,' ho said, 'all of you come up with me; you, too, Lennox, and I'll introduce ? you to Sir James Bennett. If it is to lm tlie last night of our lives, -we. may a.s well -spend it, like good fellows, together.' As they climbed the ridge Jack noted the time. 'It'e half an hour,' he said, 'since the outbreak to the west. It can not be more than six miles away now. listen. Listen to the roar of it. Hell fire, that's what it is. A devil lit it, and another devil fans it. The «alc inusc be blowing forty miles an hour.' Sir James evinced . no surprise when he learned the names of the newcomers,- bat grapped them cordially by die hand. Them was a soiisc of greater safety in numbers. No candles or lamps were lit in SalathieT» apai-tmenit, for with the doorway open it was light enoueh to gee everything, :md outside the lurid heavens ablaze above them seemed to make it brighter than day; liut it was an unnatural, almost an in fernal, brightness. 'The main body of fire should be bore ft.t a n Barter past nine,' remarked Salatliiei ' as though he were speaking of something which scarcely concerned them. 'Evary- thing that can be done to mitigate or avert disaster has been done. Wo have nothing now to do but wait' - ; 'That's the hardest part of the busi ness,' ejaculated Lennox, puffing at hi3 pipe. They were all seated outside on some ' fragments of rock, which had been ar ranged by someone aa rougli Beats, bat not a man of them epoke further. 'Look here, any friends/' said Salat&if! suddenly, 'we had better talk, or the awful 'magnificence of this thing will im - nerve ub altogether, and perhaps incapaci ? tate up for action when the crisis comes. Just look yonder at' the lake; it's c^iuison '. with the' reflection of the sky; and see, here coines the advance guard of the bat talion s of fire.' Liehted brands and sparks carried by thiivKale were now dropping thickly in ths glen like, rockets from the sky. '7.tfa nee less to waste oiir strength trying to put anything out,' «aid Jack; 'we shall want it 'presently to *cw£ ourselves. We can't ' 'wave the' kIph, that's doomed. Sec, there goes J?ao. Hoi-ley's shanty.' . ,.,'. V'What-do yo\\r think of it?' said Sir tiTau&v. turninor around to Amos. 'I sfcood ,'';,-mce,' he 'continued, , 'on, the' deck of. a *,'? imminff vessel }n jnid-oepjan;- jjpt for a.p '*?' Dallina ^ejidbWthiB surpasses everything.'' 'It ie like what the prophet saw at Btffliain j^'-said «sfttfK&wta «an awed; »ecai$eJ,r audible voice. *'The mountains around the city were full of chariots and hors^j of fire.' 'Ah,' cali^ J^iatbiel eagerly as Miough^a fiuriiliar chbrd iafl- been struck, 'thac's^it. ?JI'e wJl deliver us from the devices of them that hate us'', ? , = It was no tise, ? however^ the ecene was too grand and awful, and the tension too extreme for speech. ,. ...._., ? '.- Yet there .wa& one,' a \\yoman, who in that dread- hour not only spoke, but *ang. A voice came from one of thp caves — 'Hide, ine,-O my Saviour hide, . - Till tlic .storm of life be past.' The men listened . to the weird, sweet melody; , but na one spoke. It was strange iu thi eupreme moment, when the, whole ekyline seemed filled with deathfaces, how these men, who calmly waited there for death by fire, should have been interested men tally in trivial things. They followed with their eyes the gra dual descent of eparks and burning 'brands, wondering mechanically* which would fire a house, or tree, or paddock first. They were interested in £he wom bats and other etrauge animate Jioppinj; and running about, with strange, tern fi-ed cries, near the lake. A couple of horees came galloping and snorting down ?the glea- Avith flowing tails and manes; Ibut no one spoke. Presently came^ a dull roar, and then a terrific explosion, which ehook the glen and brought tons of rock down on all sides. It broke the spell! 'Coma in»id«,' cried Saathiel, 'and I'll cose ilia door; that was the magazine exploded. Moore ought to hear it if lie ?is anywhere between this and Kingdon Ponds.' What followed was beyond description. Sir James looked for a moment into what seemed, in a lightning glance, to be a furnace of blinding white fiame. He -drew back dazzled and euffoeated, and hanged the. door. The glen was filled with igneous?, stifling gases, which ex ploded with thunderous and stupefying reports, and burned wkh blue and white flames. The door, sheathed with iron, ?was bolted and barred, and the men sat near the wall, breathing heavily in the hot, noxious, suffocating air. Amos sud denly fell forward, fortunately ujion some skins; he had fainted; all ran to his as sistance. Salatliiel loosened his collar nnd cravat, and Lennex sprinkled water upon his face. Half an hour of scmi-eun'o«ition fol lowed. They g.-rspod and panted; it was too hot- to sweat; the fire eeenwd to have score!. ed and dried them to the bone. Presently Salathiel went to the door end listened for some time, and then flung it open. The glen was still burning like a furnace, hut somehow they breathed more freely. He explained it in a few words.' _ 'Thank God! tJie worst is over. The wind has changed and it has begun to sprinkle., with rain.' Atae! there were those, in other hiding-, places, for w/iom the change .had come too late, (To be continued.)
