 THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER. 

 The room was still lit up, as when 1 left it, but it was deserted by all but two people. Bertha and Bella, who had tidy little ways of their own, were sorting the scattered books - and sheets of music and storing them away 

 in the canterbury. . Bella was on her knees, idly smoothing the sheets under her hand, as if she hardly knew what she was about; Bertha was doing her part of looker-on, Bitting on the edge of an ottoman, with her hands clasped round her knee. They were talking earnestly in undertones, but turned to look at me, as 1 entered, in sudden and disconcerting silence. The stealthy glance that Bella shot at her sister, and-the gloomy coldness of Bertha's stare, struck me very unpleasantly. My entrance into their company had never been greeted in that way before. I im mediately concluded that they had been talking secrets, and were annoyed at being interrupted, and, as they might have thought, 

 overheard. 

 " I have come," I said hastily, " to look for a buckle I have lost off my shoe. Have you seen it anywhere V 

 "No, I haven't seen it," replied Bertha, sullenly. " I daresay it's over by that sofa, where you planted yourself all the evening." 

 1 saw it was gone when you sat down on the ottoman�after your mother fetched you out of your corner, you know," said Bella. " Tou really did display your feet so that no one conld help seeing. But 1 thought, perhaps, you had given it to Lord Westbrook for a keepsake," she added, with a disagree able giggle. " You seemed to find it so very hard to part from him." 

 I came to a standstill in the middle of the room, and stared at them in amazement. " I really don't know what you are talking, about," 1 said coldly. 

 " 0,1 daresay!" sneered Bertha. " The r6le of ing&ive is very pretty, no doubt, but it won't do to play it with us. We can see through it perfectly well." 

 " And so can others," put in Bella. 

 " Yes, indeed. Yon made yourself the laughing-stock of the whole room, I can tell 

 you." 

 " It was really quite sickening," chimed in Bella's spiteful echo again, " to see the way you threw yourself at that man's head, just because be was a lord, never letting anybody 

 else come near him!" 

 "And so barefaced�after his knowing what you had done with Regy. But, or course, he understands the sort of thing you 

 like." 

 , "Of course he does. Men are always ready to amuse themselves with anybody who runs after them." * 

 "/Hell make fun of you with his friends at fiSaclnb to-morrow; that's all you'll get by 

 it," 

 I could hardly believe my ears, and I was absolutely struck dumb with astonishment nd rage. For a few seconds after this pause in their tirade I could not say a word, be

 " I shouldn't have thought shame was a feeling you were much troubled with, should you, Belial It is we, I think, who have reason to be ashamed when one of our own family behaves as you have done to-day." Bertha flounced off her ottoman as she made thiB polite remark, and Bella, in angry haste, began to gather her loose music together, asking her sister, " What else was to be ex pected!" in a stage aside that must have been perfectly audible to the footman who was putting out the lights on the stairs. 

 " That will do," I said, at a white heat of j indignation that was too intense for further i speech. " I am going up to my mother. She j will be very sorry that she ever permitted me j to be exposed to this sort of thing, which is 

 not at all in our way." I 

 This was rather a weak ending to my bold line of action, but lit was a stroke that took more effect than anything I had said before. 

 " You will be very mean if you go and tattle <o your mother about everything we say," 

 Bertha began hastily. 

 "And of course we don't mean quite all we say when we are a little put out�nobody does," continued Bella, in evident anxiety to smooth things down. " Don't go until you have found your buckle, Kitty ; if it is one of the silver ones, it is too valuable to lose. It is under the ottoman, perhaps." 

 But I swept across the room with my head in the air, and scorned to consider buckles 

 at such a moment. 

 " Come back, Kitty, and don t be silly ! called Bertha, with sharp insistauce. 

 "Kitty, Kitty dear!" repeated Bella's softer voice, wailing abjectly, "do stay till 

 we tell you " 

 But I closed the door behind me, with a bang that must have made all the " articles of virtue " jump, whisked up the tail of my gown and flew upstairs, never pausing until I had burst into my father's dressing-closet, the door of which, standing ajar, showed me he was still in the smoking-room, and made 

 my way to mother. 

 She was sitting before her lpoking-glass, slowly brushing her hair�hair that was almost as bright and plentiful as my own� with a pleasant sort of dreamy meditative ness in her gentle face, as if her thoughts were happy ones. " Ah, my Kitty," she exclaimed, looking up brightly as I entere d; " I was jus wondering whether you were in bed, love. Why, why, what is the matter? My dear 

 one, what is the matter ?" 

 She turned round on her chair, and held out her hand, and I flung myself on the floor before her, buried my head in her lap, and gave way to my pent-up passion in a violent 

 burst of tears. 

 " 0 mother, take me away from this house! Take me away from these horrid people. I can't bear it!" were my first words, as soon as 1 could speak. 

 " Hush, dear, you must not speak of your father's relations in that way," she mur mured, stroking my hair. But there was that in her voice that told me her quick sense had divined the nature of my trouble, and that she was ready to identify herself with it as fully as I could desire. 

 "They say�they say�that I have been throwing myself at his head because he is a 

 lord," I sobbed. 

 " They must have sadly forgotten them selves, " she replied. " That was Bertha and Bella, I suppose? Aunt would be incapable of so coarse a thought." 

 " Yes, it was Bertha and Bella. I found them alone just now, when I went back to the drawingroom to look for something; and they set upon me, mother�they set upon me as if I had been a kitchen maid, and had done everything that was gross and immodest, just because they are jealous that Lord West brook talked to me more than to them. I never thought anybody would dare to insult me so! They said I made myself the laughing-stock of the whole room, and that he woula make fun of me at his club to morrow because I ran after him. O, mother, they said he did it because he knew, by my having gone out alone with Begy to-day, that I was the sort of girl whom men could amuse themselves with, and that I should like it!" I looked up at her with streaming eyes as I detailed my bitter grievances, and 1 did not seek her sympathy in vain. The colour bad risen to her face, and an angry glitter to her soft eyes. She drew me up,to her with eager fondness, but with hands that trembled with her indignation. " I always saw that they were not well-bred or nice," she said quickly, "and I disliked them as companions for you. I am sorry to Bay it, as they are your cousins. They have not been brought up in a good school, I fear. But I did not think them capable of such coarse 

 ness as that." 

 " I told them they were coarse, mother." 

 "Didyou, dear?" smiling a little. "You had better have said nothing, but have left them at once. You must not allow yourself to give way to rude language, whatever pro vocation yon may have." 

 " No, mother; that was nearly all I said. But oh, must we go on staying here? I do 

 hate it so!" 

 "Of conrse not," she replied promptly. " Certainly not. You may make your mind easy about that, Kitty. I will speak to your father to-nightt and we will make some arrangement with Aunt Kate to return to Brookleigh with her. She is very anxious .to have us, so that it can easily be managed. Only mind, dear�no scenes or squsbbleB about it. Behave to your cousins as usual� as a lady would�while you remain, and do not give anF of the family cause to suppose that we are going away in dudgeon, after such a warm welcome as we have had. That would be in very bad taste." .... 

 " No, mother, I'll try not. Only if I at tempt to say civil things to Bertha and Bella, after what tbey said to me to-night, 1 am sure the words will choke me." 

 " Do not a ttempt it, except when I am with you. Keep as much with me or your father as you can while you remain here." 

 " I wish I had been tied to your apron strings all this miserable day!" I sighed sadly, " Don't lose Bight of me any more, mother, until we get clear of London. I sup pose Eleanor and! will M all right at Brook leigh, rambling about the lanes. I couldn't very well get into trouble there." 

 "I can trust you, my Kitty, whether here or there," said mother, kissing me with grave fondness. " J am never afraid that yon will be guilty of anjrthing worse than An indiscre tion for want of knowing. And hi for trouble, come and tell all your troubles to me, ea you have done- to-night: that is all I ask. My dear, dear, true girl," she broke out in an un wonted fervour of motbertinesp, "1 don't think I wotild have you in any way different from what you are, or tfhat yp� tritt he.'

 to afford him an opportunity for praising me, 

 as he loved to do, for having sung so sweetly and looked so nice. , , , 

 " We'll have two or three more white frocks for you, old woman," said he. " It was quite refreshing to look at you amongst all those bedizened young frumps." , ,, , 

 " 0 daddy, bedizened ! Some of them had beautiful dresses." ,, _ 

 " Had they ? Then they didn't set them off, that's all I can say. They'll have to come to young Australia to learn, after all�" 

 " Harry, Harry," called mother, who did not approve of this sort of thing. Let the child go to bed, and don't talk nonsense. 

 And so my long day was over at last. I went to my own bedroom, and locked the door (with some sort of vague idea of pro tecting myself against further molestation), and I felt as if a year had been added to my experience of life Bince I had risen from bed in the morning. I was tired of it all as tired could be, but I was too much excited and upset to be able to take mother's advice, and forget all about it and go to sleep. What I should have liked to do, but for those city streets, which now seemed to hem me round and suffocate me, was to tuck up my Bkirts and set off for a long walk. I would have done it if I had been at Narra porwidgee, only, as I dismally reflected, all this could never have happened there. Often and often had I stolen out into the soft and fragrant darkness when I was too hot to sleep, or was otherwise restless ; just turning the button of my French window (which was all the fastening it had or needed), and stepping down the verandah into the garden, and thence out into the bush. Some times Spring and I had a glorious opossum hunt before we returned to our head-quarters; 

 sometimes, when more meditatively disposed, we sat under the apple tree in the orchard and ate fruit; more than once we stole across the paddocks, and had a dip in the river�at those times when long-continued north winds and bush fires together had made things very bad for sleeping. But those days�or, rather, those nights�were all over and done with now. There was no such thing to be dreamed of as a nocturnal ramble out of doors with only a'dog for company. Good gracious, no; I should think not, indeed! 

 I did what I could for freedom. I opened my window widely and leaned out, after ex tinguishing the candles on the dressing table. It was a lovely night, though with a chill in it that no such summer night would have known atNarraporwidgee�a chill which crept unawares through my French em broideries, and gave me an ache in my bones next day. The stars were shining over the tall roofs of the square; the hanging garden on the drawingroom balcony below me sent up whiffs of delicious fragrance now and then; a sweet little bird was cheeping some where during intervals of wakefulness, and I wondered why he stopped in London when he had all the country to go to. Carriages rumbled in the street below, flashing their lamp-lights from side to side; but I was too high up to see into them, and I did not want lamps. I leaned my elbow on the window sill and looked up at the stars, and they swam like silver bubbles of all shapes and sizes through a mist of bitter tears. 

 " 0 Tom, Tom," my heart was crying all the time, " 0 my dear, dear love I Where are you now ? And why cannot I be where you are ?" I never felt so appalled before by the awful distance that parted us from one another. He could not even see the same stars that I saw. For the matter of that, he could never see stars at all when 1 saw them. 

 Here was I, in this still, dark, quiet summer j night, all alone to think of him; and there was he, at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, riding about his run, full of business, break ing in hiB young homes, perhaps, or inter viewing dealers who came to buy sheep. One on one side of the world and one on the other, and two long years to come before ejther could stir hand or foot towards bridging that gulf of 15,000 miles between them. And no letters, no messages, no any thing. 

 This piteous state of things assumed a tragic aspect that was altogether too much for me in my excited state. 1 knelt on a stool, and laid my head on the window-ledge, and cried with all my heart (for the third time that day)�whispering passionate nonsense under my breath to my darling far awfy, who, perhapB, so hopeless did the future look, might never hear my voice again in this world. Things I would not have said to him if I had been with him I said to the phantom I clasped in my empty arms and hugged close to my breast�whatever it was that stood for Tom, to be clung to in my troubled Bolitude. And yet my love and longing could not find expression in the utmoBt abandonment of speech. 

 However, the little outburst did me good. It worked off my superfluous excitement, and left me quiet to go to sleep, ,
