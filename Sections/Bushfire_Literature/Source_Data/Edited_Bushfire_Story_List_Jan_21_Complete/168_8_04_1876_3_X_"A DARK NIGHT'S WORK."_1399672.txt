 He crowed the nver, thmking he would be less likely to meet with acquaintances on the other side He had no definite idea where he was going Motion and solitude weie all he wanted Evidently a storm was at baud, but he rather liked the idea than otherwise Ihese occasional premonitory flishe� were chi'dspli) to what was going ou m his own soul It would be a relief to him if it carno down with a vengeance His clothes-he thought of thit ev en now-w ere Ins olde t and w orst, and no one vv ould ever see lum in them again 

 He formed the half resolution to go Mary s house The old man might be dead �or ought he knew He groped along m the dai kuess lu the direeh n of South Busborough, but turned again before he had gone a hundred yaids He would be sure to leam in the morning if it weie so It would bo time enough then, and he could find li om the doctor how the Rise stood He was ifiaid to meet Mary Dry dale 

 There was a flash, and a roar of thunder above his head and he felt himself grasped b) the arm, and heard a piteous voice saying to him, 

 "Tell me wheie I am1 I am wandering in 

 tho dai k 

 Another flash, and another, and each had recogui ed each Shiress trembled fioin head to foot A moment before, he had been picturing this m in de id , and sudden in the lui id light the spectral t ice had flashed on him, and a sepul 

 eural voice hid spoken and now in the utter iVukne s Ina arm was held with a gi asp of death Was this something burst from the other world to tear the mask fiom his soul, and -no it was too ie.il a grasp foi that But a cold sweat, coldei than the i am that wr is now da'hing on them, streamed from his forehead a3 he tried to shake oft the unwelcome incubus 

 Another flush, and another The) came so frequent and so close ou ona another that it seeuitd aa it all he vv eu vv aa one continuous flame 

 "What dev ii brought you aci oss my path at this moment ! hissed out ShneoS, with a sharp tie�s ot malignity that w as fiercer than the stot m 

 itself 

 'Its you, Simes1 Its) on! No, no ' 111 no let yo go I 

 Thanks to Mi Pirselles wine, there was yet a lemnaut of strength �n him 

 " I tell )e 111 no let go 

 Como with me now now 

 to Mr Patselle' 

 Ihe disjointed utter ince was caused hythe continued but ineffectual stroggle which Sluress was making to free himself But at the name 

 of Mr P u selle he stood stock still 

 "What have yon to do with Mt Parselle ? he ci led, peeimg into the face that was so like death in life, with the pla) of tho lightning upon it momently followed by evamshmeut Seen and gone, seen and gone, theie was au unnatural honor about the livid countenauce woise than the palloi he had seen on it by daj 

 "What havo you to do with Mt Pusellel he again repeated 

 "Vi hat have you to do with lum, rather! 

 letorted the uncle " Shiress, vv here is Mai) Di)sdaloi M hat have you done with Miuy Dr) sdalo ! 

 Iheie was a crash that staggered them both The lightning had "truck a tree close by them, and the loar and tlattei above them was as if the heaveus wtre tending amndei But ns the temi est rageel the old mau s voiio rose loudei and loudei With the rain driving in his eats, and peal upon peal deafening him more and more, Shirtss could oui) catch sti ay scraps of w hat he 

 w as saying 

 " And he sa) s I must prov e it, and I mil prov e 

 it' 

 "Pi ove what/' cried Shu ess, but again the ram dashed in his ears, and he missed the answer He was now diaggmg himself, the old man still clinging to him, to where he fancied he remembered a lock under the shelter of which ho might le irn w hat he feared to kuow " Pt ov e what' he uled agun and "curse that1 he hissed out \\a auothei (lash showed the thin old lips mov iu0 w ith w ords he could not hear 

 They got partially under shelter, and ^hiress caught the fag end of a speech 

 " your father ' and I will confront you w ith him now now ' 

 And closer still the old hands tightened on him, and tried to diag him along bj force 

 " What about ni) f ither < 

 " All about him I Come I Come i 

 Thero vva3 a struggle, and a blow , and the next tinah that came showed a vv lute face lying on the ground, the lips moving no longer, and the hands tightening onl) on themselv es 

 The tame flash show ed a mau standing upnght, with his head thrown back, and his haud3 upou his blow, and the ram beating on his hand 

 All the ptevtous peals rolled into one would not hue i mailed the aw ful cr ish til it now shook the himameut ind made the solid gi mud leverbei ite ns if there w et t eai thquake as w ill as tcuij nt abro id But the m m stood perfectl) still Hi was hearing worse than that 

 \\\\ eie the i unes on him ahcady ' Audible to him thtough the thuuder and the raging of the w md, and the rush of the h ul mingled vv ith the ram, fiom every quarter of the storm carnea thons md piteous voices wailing out, "I am w andei mg in the dark ' I um w andering in the 

 daik 

 Hie storm censed It seemed as it that tre mullions outburst had been the last couv ulsion of tcinble travail and a lull of exhaustion had 

 come md the hirth was death Fitful gleams still llickeied and vanished, as if the night weie )ct fain to look upon the awful progen) of I tempest and terror, took sudden short glauce� at 

 the fearful portent, and then hld its face in dismay 1 ar oft rev erberant resonance rolling into ei ei greiter and grtater distance seemed to tell that the news was spreading, and that the ul turn tes of creation weie shuddering at the new bom horroi The mysterious sense of w utiug and prepiration had passed awa) There was a feeling that the dread woik was done, and min opened their doors, and looked foi th, and sighed, le s from a sen e of relief than from au undefined pain of wondering tonjeeture as to the unknown issues of the night 

 The piteous watlings h id died into yet articu late sighs "I am wandering in the dark1 

 seemed to follow the retiring thunder, till it quiv ered into the infinitude of yet more piteous 

 silence 

 Breaking from hi3 stupor Shiress threw him self beside the body He felt for a pulse , tor the heart put his ear to the chest hi3 cold cheek to the colder lips He fancied that the instant the old man had lallen he had caught the utter ince of some word from him, but it was so mixed up with the noise of tho thunder and the driving ram and with his own simultaneous horror that it had fallen on his ear with no impress of meaning Oh if he would but utter one word now . Might not one w ord be w orth a soul ' And as he thought this, the word came back to him in that m)stenous way in which words Kill sometimes take shipe and meaning on the brain long after they hav e been uttered It was not much It was merely the word " �littra In his perturbation he mwtook the viv id revival of the impression for the utterance itself He coul 1 have sworn that the lips had spokeu the word now as he bent over them 

 V� hat a strange thing is human nature, as wonderful at its worst as at its best A moment before, a vv ord would hav e been worth a soul 

 But now when h� thought he heard the vv ord, his right hand was feeling about in the dark for the stick that he had dropped I He feared his uncle dead, but he feared him living too In the stnfulness of his soul he had left himself no alternative of good He still had his left hand upon the heart in the hope of detecting a return of pulsation, while his right was tightening 

 round the now found stick as if toiectifyany i detected incompleteness in his deadly woik But there was nothing further to do He made sute 

 of that 

 The conflict of *wo opposite fears, however, had at least served the purpose of awakening his faculties to somewhat of their customary keen ness The one thing now was concealment He leaned agamat the rock under lee of which the bod) was lying, and tried to reflect calmly He had no fear of detection m his present position He was quite off the road , the hour was very late , and tins was not a night on which anyone was likely to be abroad <There was no house near The night, the hour, and the spot weie all in his 

 favor 

 He cheLked his first impulse, which wns to cast the bod) over the rocks, feaimg the noise which the fulling mass might make in the now stiller night From currviug it down he shrank with still greater apprehension, the dark ness being such as to render it linpos tblo to des cry the pathwa), or to keep it, especially with 

 such a burden 

 What came next into his unud was the fact 

 that a misfortune (so he mined it inwardly) of this sort is generallv traced home to the murd to the survtv ing participator, not so much by means of the discover) oi the-pelion of the deceased, as by little accessor) tokens left thoughtlessly about the scene of the iccident Thereupon he leaned his stick at an angle aaaiust the rock, stamped he iv lly on the m dille of it vv ith his foot t ill it broke m tw o, and ca� i led the fragments to the edge of the ht0h rock) b ink He flung one of them as finis he could m the 

 dnectiou of the nv i listened if he caul 1 catch the �ound of n si lash thought he did so and then with equal force threw the other ifter it 

 He returned to the bodj The honor was coming on him agjiu He actuallv thought for a moment of the fi cinatiou which bodies in such cnciimstancea arc sud sometimes to exercise on 

 men in his pwition, compelling them nguust their will ever and evei to return to look upon their woik But no He assured him elf that tin� was not what ho had come back for He kneeled down, waiting for the harmless and evtn useful flickers 

 of the now spent stoim Bj aid of the oft renew ed momentary gie mis he searched rouud and round the scene of accident for mi) thing that might serve as a trace of his piesence But he found nothing He st al ched his pockets lest anj thing might hav e di opped out Nothing 

 He next examiued the bodj The narrative proceeds calmlv, but Shire s w is not calm On the upper, outer plane of his nature there was keen intellectual work going on, balinciug of chance and rapid spasms ot lesolution Beneath this a cert uti moial stupor, consciouslj tempo raiv, mule it possible for the intellect to woik without moving o� into the ti ickliss diveigences of madness But below all in the raging deeps of the soul itself, stoi m ind v olcamc furj vv ero aire uly struggling with repression, aud shaking the foundations ot his being 

 He eximmed tho bodj Still bj the aid of the fitful glue, he di coveied tint there weie no marks ot blood d scei niblc ou face oi hands He 

 shudileied as he tinned the heav) wet head, vnd the cold sodden hands, but se irehe 1 none the less caiefiilly There was a contusion on the forehead w here the blow h id fallen It seemed a 

 vei) slight thing to be the ostensible impiess of so sudden mortaht), but it hld lequiicd little violence to quench the fiintly smoking flax Again he felt about, and then di iggcd a sm di but lugged block of stone towaid the heal, tin nid the body ovei with the faco downwards mid the bruised foiohtxdou tho edgo of the stone In the act of tinning it ovei, Ins fingeis uuw lttingl) entei ed tho ou tel bl east pocket of the dead mau s co it, and touched whit ho felt was a letter He took it uut md ti insftiitd it to his ow n pocket 

 Had he been seen (lining tho next few minutes, a spectatoi vv ould hav e concluded lum a liai in less lunatic The same su] poseu spectatoi might have imagined that the same supposed luuitic vv as indulging the fane) of tr) ing to extinguish a bush fire V� ith a leaf) bough which he had bioken fiom n neighboimg tree, he went to and fro, whipping the tuft� of gins� md the patchis of sand mid wet blown leaves, wheiovci he thought that a doublo ti ick of footpi nits might possibl) bo di�itruible thanks to the mond stupoi, the lutelltct was still woikiug keenl), though the storm and vole une fin) below weie writhing as befoie for distinctive outbiust He moved slowly bickward towaid where the load was, cmefullj touching up each stealthy foot pi mt ind a vv ide sp ite around it vv ith the le if) bough At the edge of the road ho turned and le iptd aci oss the footp ith into tho flowing run nell, down which he waded ankle deep till he thought he could safel) step foith upon the mm) uitted lughw i) 

 Then he stood still, and listened, and ti ombled, and thought of the de id man 1) mg in tho daik Was it all real, oi was it a hideous dream ! Ah, too leal, for here was the bough jet ni his hand He di opped it in sudden hoi i or, but tho dread leaht) was as palpable as ever Had ho reilly meant to do it' Could ho i ee ill a positiv e in stmt of substautiil intention before stukiug the blow ? \\\\ as it not nil a quick confusion in w hull lesponsibiht) had no put whitevei? Was he 

 not the victim of cuiscd misfortune rnthei thin of detei mmate crime � But he i cmeuibei ed feel 

 mg for his stick w ith the blood) iftei thought of completion-and ran onvvaid 

 No, he must not i un He might meet some one 1\\ o man had ev er seen lum run md this, along with-that, might amount to a susi leious coincidence Oh, the cruel repression of walking with measured steps when iiniueasurc 1 igonj is goading to the swiftness of despei ition I 

 He was bound to cross the nvei and if pos lble, enter his own home imputan I 1 

 have been out ill night w nil in tho event of what might be, put his eise m the vvoist light Moreover, he would show himself cool and otu posed, at the ferrj ne irest to tho scuio of c it is tiophe No min in suspici in> circumstances woul 1 be like!) to do th it In si ite of his el i

 A guilt) man he nr0ued, rightly or vvr ngl), would cross at the furthest fin y lo act js lit would have acted if nothing uiiusuil hid hip pened, would assurtdl) bi the i mise ltast open to suspicion 

 He reached the step3 at which he lill landed little more thin au hour before, but he lecillcd the urcumsUnco as if from a distant ige an 1 from some other lite Ihe sound of his own 

 voice calling to the boatman at the opposite sido 

 m ide him shudder anew Itceemed to be some bod) else B voice, mid to hav e a tone of guilt) igonj in i* that profaned the solitude of the place, and the quiet of the city sleeping over there No answer coming he had to call again and again \\\\ hen at length he caught a distant surly response the first sound of outwarl human life he had heard since the deid had seveied him from his kind ho was inmdid to turn and flic, so sharp!) did tho ontrast stnkc him between life and de ith In a moment of almost torpid waiting it had seemed to him as if death were evtryvvhuo but the gnui edi > of a human voice fell on him vv ith sudilcu and keen awakening to the knowledge that minkind was i living force and an aven0mg one 

 Hie plash of the oar neiring and Hearing tin ough the dai kness till he c mid hear the swish of the water round the bow, the measure! ere ik of the row locks that accompanied each str ko, the change in the sound when the boatman backing one oar, turned the boat as he approached the stei s, familiar experiences enough, all smote it] ou him now with an intolerable sense of nov el ty which he struggled to call absurd, but could not 

 "That was something like a storm sir, said the boatman, when Sluress, having gathered all his capability of composuie, had stepped into the 

 boat 

 A grunt from Shiress seeme 1 to indicate that he concurred in the opinion of its having re sembled one very clo-iel) 

 " Sh juldn t be surprised to hear something in the morning, sir, resumed the boatman 

 There n as a lantern in the bottom of the boat Braithwaite felt the glare of it on his face, stooped down, and turned the transparent Bide 

 of it from him 

 " Pit) those as was out m it,' continued the 

 unconscious tormentor 

 " Let me pull 1 cried Shiress, getting desperate vv ith inaction, and making a step forward to take 

 the oars 

 "Seen Old Tom, sir?'said the other, half standing up to make the transfer 

 Sbtres3 fell back in his Beat 

 " Seen whom ! he said at length, in the most nothing unusual style he could muster " Pull away I think 111 sit still Seen 

 whom t 

 " Old Tom The old cove as carnea me�sagea and such He crossed ov er here more'n an hour ago He was sittin on the steps, and when I axed him what he was after, he said, Mr Braithwaite Said he had been to your place, sir, an you wasn t to home I told him you had crossed over not long afore that, an wi that he ups nu' down into the boat I tells him there s a storm abrewm, but he nev er Bays nothin but Braithwaite, Braithwaite, Braithwaite An bo I

 It flashed through Brmthwaite's horror stnckeu Boul that Tate was n eav mg the chain already lu one mind, and poasibl) m more, he was already connected with the old man on that parttcular night And the stark w itness of the enme was lying over there, and the morning was coming .
