 CHAPTER XVII. 

 TELLING DOLLY THE NEWS. 

 Dolly's home in the Forest was a very humble one, only a weatherboard cottage with a shingle roof and a broad verandah in front. It was high on the side of a hill facing the south, so that they sot refreshing sea breezes sometimes in the middle of the summer, but there was no view. The dense close forest shut them in on every side; only just round the house was 

 a small cleared space, part of which was laid out a garden, where Roger cultivated 

 vegetables in his spare time, and Dolly managed to grow a few flowers. Not that there was much difficulty about it. In the rich vegetable soil, once the land was cleared, the flowers grew like weeds, and the only trouble was water. Pumping it up from tlie well took time and labour, and often neither Roger nor the man who helped him on the little selection had time to spare, but even then Dolly herself would pump sometimes rather than her precious garden should 

 suffer. 

 And she had her reward. The little house nestling among the hills was a charming little home, as different as well could be from the weatherboard cottages surrounded by un- lovely potato plots which as a rule are the homes of the selectors in the Heytesbury Forest. In years to come the southern lands of Victoria may be all smiling cornfields, where the fierce heat of an Australian summer is always tempered by the cool breezes from the Southern Ocean, but at present the ranges between Geelong and Warrnambool are densely wooded, covered with immense trees and a scrub so thick that the work of clearing the land and malting it fit for the use of man is worthy of Hercules himself. And yet there are many settlers there, for the land, once cleared, is rich and valuable. 

 The summer of '85-86 was exceptionally hot even in the south of Victoria, and Dolly bemoaned that her garden was being 

 ruined. 

 "It'll be all dead with the heat, Roger," she said. "Ruth won't admire it at all." 

 "Oh, yes, she will. She'll understand resides, think what the Kooringa-garden must be like this summer." 

 And Roger was right. To Ruth, coming from the turmoil and discomfort of Kooringa, the little cottage on the hill was a very haven 

 of rest. 

 "Burnt up, Dolly? Indeed, no. You should just see Kooringa garden. And how well the passion flower has grown over the verandah! It makes quite a little bower. And those gladioli, how fine they are!" 

 " I do think it's rather nice," said Dolly, pleased. "I water that creeper well, though, for it's so close to the house and no trouble. But, oh dear, there really is a good deal to do about the house. I wonder if you see any falling off. You see baby wants such a lot of attention now he's beginning to walk, and with only one servant there's really a good deal to do." 

 "You manage wonderfully, Dolly, I think," said her sister, ready as of old to admire anything Dolly did. "It must be such 

 hard work." 

 "Why, no," said Dolly. "You see, it's all for Roger and myself and baby, so it makes such a difference. You know, you really don't seem to care how hard you work when it's to make your home nice, do you?" 

 "No," said Ruth, and Dolly went on. 

 "It's so nice to work for Roger. He's so pleased with everything I do. Oh, Ruth, I'm such a happy woman." 

 "Dolly, I'm so thankful." 

 "If only you were happily married too, Ruth, if only----" 

 "Come wife, come," Roger's voice broke in on their tete-a-tete. "Come out and show Ruth round the estate. It's ai little cooler now, and you might open the windows." 

 Ruth rose up thankfully. She had not yet told her sister of her engagement to Dr. Finlayson, and somehow she was glad to put it off for a space. She must tell her soon, she knew, but the engagement seemed to have been almost forced upon her by circum- stances, and she could hardly yet decide whether she was glad or sorry to throw in her lot with the doctor. At least to-morrow would be soon enough to tell Dolly, she thought, as they wandered round the little farmyard in the cool of the evening inspect- ing the cocks and the hens, and stirring up the pigs to make them show off their good 

 points. 

 "They're real Berkshire pigs," said Dolly proudly, "and it was my idea entirely having them, wasn't it, Roger. You see, I'm sure pigs pay beat of all, and we grow vegetables so easily it seems a shame not to have them. Roger was afraid they'd be a bother, because he and Davis sometimes when they're clear- ing on the other side of the place arn't in till after dark. But I knew I could feed them. Gretchen and I--she takes as much interest in them as I do--and then they make such a dilference. Why, our last pigs we bought when they were tiny little things at 3s. each, and after we'd had them three months we sold them at about �2 each. Wasn't that good?" 

 "She's a capital little farmer, this wife of mine," said Marsden laughing, but evidently very proud of his wife. "Look at all her cocks and hens there. They're all to be 

 turned into solid cash I'm told." 

 "Now, Roger, you're laughing. Look here, Ruth. I made �30 clear out of my poultry and eggs last year. Wasn't that a good lot? Pigs go into the general funds, you know, but the poultry is my very own." 

 "Married woman's property," said Roger. "She's got a stocking somewhere, and she's hoarding, Ruth. She won't let me touch any of that money." 

 "No, of course not. Don't you think I'm right, Ruth. That's a reserve fund. If we ever want money very, very badly there'll be that, and if we don't I shall save it for the boy. He must go to the grammar school, like his father, and he must have a university education if we can only afford it. So you see it's best to begin saving now." 

 "Wise Dolly," said Roger, patting her hand, and Ruth, smiling assent, wondered if she could ever be so happy. If ever to her would come the peace and joy of loving and being loved. 

 To many such a life would have seemed sordid and hard and narrow, but Dolly standing there in the evening sunlight in her neat blue print with her baby in her arms and her husband by her side was a 

 person to be envied by her elder sister. 

 She called herself ungrateful when next day brought her a long letter from Dr. Finlay- 

 son, so tender and so loving--so full of her and her only--surely not Dolly herself had more wealth of love lavished on her. Surely she could be a happy woman too, if only she would take the love which was offered so freely instead of looking vainly backwards 

 at what could never be. 

 She read her letter in the short Australian twilight; in the next room she could hear Dolly singing softly as she hushed her boy to sleep, and out on the verandah her brother-in-law, his labours over for the day, was puffing away at his pipe. 

 "A penny, Ruth,* he said, coming to the window, "a penny for your thoughts. You haven't spoken a single solitary word since I brought you that letter, and I want to be entertained now my work's done." 

 "A penny for yours then, I'm sure you leant against that post so long I thought y0u were never going to move again. Come now, what were yours?" 

 "I was thinking I ought to get another pig. I could easily put in a few more vege- tables, and Dolly manages so splendidly there's always plenty of milk. Then I 

 might put something away towards the 

 boy's education, too." 

 "Dolly would be so pleased," said Ruth; and then added with a little laugh, "Dear me, the care of matrimony." 

 "It has its compensations," said Marsden, sitting down himself in a garden seat close to the window, so that he had his sister-in-

 law �n full view. "You haven't embarked on its troubled waters yet, Ruth; why's 

 that." 

 "Nobody asked me, sir," shee laughed. 

 "Now, what's the good of telling me fibs. As if I didn't see with my own eyes Maitland was awfully gone on you two years ago. I never could make out why that never came to anything, for I used to think you rather liked him, too." 

 "Just like a man," she said, looking him bravely in the face, though she felt the blood mounting to her cheeks. "Just like a man. We took compassion on one another because you and Dolly were so absorbed in one another that if we had not got up a rival flirtation, we'd have been dreadfully dull and 

 out in the cold." 

 "Oh, yes; it's all very well to put it that way, but if ever I saw a man in love it was Maitland. You have not met for two years, have you? I wonder if he's got over it. I suppose you know he's at Tamba now." 

 "Is he?" she managed to ask. 

 "Oh, yes, Waterworks or something. 

 Shall I ask him over?" 

 "No, no; what nonsense--not for me." 

 "What," he asked in astonishment, "you mean to say you wouldn't care to meet Mait- land after being such chums. Well, I----" 

 "Well, you what?" asked Dolly, coming into the sittingroom, and putting her arm round her sister's neck. "Well, you 

 what?" 

 "Don't understand women." 

 "Pooh, my beloved husband; whoever supposed you did." 

 "Well, but Ruth says she wouldn't care to see Maitland. Arn't women fickle. We were thinking of asking him down for Christmas, weren't we, Dolly?" 

 Dolly, with her hand on her sister's shoulder, could not fail to see she was some- what more agitated than the occasion seemed to warrant. She had always thought there was something between her sister and Dick Maitland, and now that she had the chance determined to put matter straight. 

 "Yes, of course, we'll ask him," she said. "I expect he'll be awfully glad to come. Tamba's a dull place to spend Christmas 

 in." 

 "It's so far," objected Ruth. 

 "Well, I like that, considering Maitland used to ride over 10 miles just to spend an afternoon with you. Do you remember the cold afternoon I was skinning sheep, and you two girls came down, and then Maitland and Finlayson rode up. That was the begin- ning of it, wasn't it? Weren't they jolly times. Poor old Finlayson, though, he was always a bit out of it. And he's such a good sterling chap, too, is Alick, I suspect he's really the best at bottom, though one couldn't help taking to Dick Maitland. Poor old Alick! He's doing very well, I hear; making his fortune in fact. I hope some de- signing woman doesn't catch him for his 

 cash." 

 "What would you say?" began Ruth, feel- ing that she must tell them of her engage- ment. "What would you say--if--if--I told you that--that--" 

 "Not that you're engaged to Dr. Finlay- son?" asked Dolly impetuously, and, seeing confirmation in her sister's face, flung her arms round her, and kissed her in the old warm-hearted loving style. 

 "Oh, Ruth, I'm delighted--delighted! Roger, isn't it good news?" 

 "You're a lucky young woman," he said, "a very lucky young woman. So that's why you didn't want to see Maitland. Poor old Dick, it will be a blow to him; but, after all, I believe you've chosen wisely." 

 Dolly could talk of nothing else. Not only that evening, but all the long hot days when Roger and his man went away to their work on the other side of the selection, and the two women were left to their household duties, assisted by one maid servant--a solemn young woman, who, though she was English to all intents and purposes, yet re- tained enough of the characteristics of her German parentage to make her an invaluable 

 servant. 

 "It's delightful, isn't it? You mothered me when I was married, and now I must look after you. I suppose you have not fixed the day yet?" 

 "Oh, yes," said Ruth, bending her blush- ing face down over the plums she was stoning for the Christmas pudding--for a Christmas pudding is a necessity in Australia, even though the thermometer be at 105deg. in the shade--" oh yes, we have--at least I thought about the middle of February, but Dr. Finlay- son wants it at the end of January." 

 "What!" Dolly spilt all the flour she was weighing out in her surprise. "February! My goodness, you are in a hurry. I'll just write to Melbourne to-night to Moubray's and tell them to send us a roll of longcloth and another of muslin. We'll begin on your trousseau, at once. But my dear child, you can't possibly be married before June at the very least. We might manage by May, but then May's unlucky." 

 "But I shan't want much," protested Ruth. "It isn't as if I were going to have a grand wedding. Not even as mildly grand as yours was. You see I can't be married from Kooringa." 

 "Indeed no, you must be married from here, and Roger and I'll do our very best for you. The little church ia only five miles away. Really not so far as Mullin's Hill, you know. But have yon quarrelled altogether with the Kooringa people? Aunt used to be kind in her way." 

 "So she is still. Only they were so awfully angry about Polly, you know. And then when I told them next morning I was going to marry Dr. Finlayson, it was worse than ever. I really don't think anybody but the children spoke to me afterwards, and they were all in disgrace for tumbling into the water. So, Dolly, you see I really must be married soon, and if you'll only keep me till the wedding, I'll----" 

 "Keep you, dear? You know I'm only too delighted to have you for as long as ever you'll stay, and you mustn't be married before June, for goodness knows when we'll ever be together again. Do you hear, 

 Ruth?" 

 Ruth nodded, and her sister went on, 

 "I wonder what has become of Polly? Will Ned Clegg marry her, do you think?" 

 "Oh, it's all right. I was going to tell you, only you've talked so persistently of my engagement I haven't had a chance. In Dr. Finlayson's letter--well, Alick, then--in his last night's letter he says he thought I wouldn't be happy unless I knew what had become of them. So he asked every creature he came across, till at last Arthur King confessed he knew they were going to Geelong, and then he traced them easily enough. They had been married somehow or other, I don't quite understand how, and were having a mild little honeymoon on the 

 �38 he'd saved with a view to matrimony. Alick said he found them in very poor lodgings, and they looked such a boy and girl, in spite of the dignity of the married state, that he gave them a good talking to, and asked them what they intended to do 

 next." 

 "Go back to Kooringa and be forgiven, I suppose. Fancy Polly married! I can only think of her as a fat, over-grown girl in dresses much too short for her." 

 "Well, her dresses are still too short for her. I helped her make two new ones just before she ran away, and that's all the trousseau she had, poor girl. No, they won't forgive her at Kooringa though. Alick says both he and Lily tried their very best. He says he thinks though that James Wilson doesn't want another son-in-law on the station, and I can't make him see that he's about the very worst advocate poor Polly could have had, at least with Ann and 

 aunt." 

 "Poor Ann, it is hard on her, when she thought she'd made an impression, too. But what's to become of the ncwly-married couple? Thirty-eight pounds won't last for 

 ever." 

 "That's what Alick said to the young man. He was full of all sorts of wild notions, but Alick recommended him to get a place at once and stick to it, and not to build any hopes on the old folks relenting. However, he says he was able to settle them before he left, for that night at the club he met Lowe, of Bandelowie--you know, on the Darling, not far from Wilcannia. Ile was growling about his men, so Alick recom- mended him to try young Clegg. He didn't 

 much like the idea of a wife, but finally agreed to take him. Alick sent for him, and he just jumped at it. Mr. Lowe's pay their expenses up, give him 30s. a week and a hut to themselves. Poor Polly!" 

 "Lucky Polly! After all it's not bad. She's got the man she wants--she's never been accustomed to any luxury--and she'll do very well if only she doesn't have too many children. But how good of Alick Fin- layson, wasn't �t?" 

 "He is good, you don't know how good he is," said Ruth looking at her sister with flushed cheeks and tearful eyes. 

 "And are you as much in love with him as he is with you, Ruth?" asked Dolly. 

 "I--I don't know," faltered Ruth, "we have been such friends since you went away, and till last week I never thought--I--I mean I was so surprised." 

 "Well so was I," assented Dolly frankly, "but that doesn't prevent me being delighted all the same. Rger thinks you're a very lucky girl, and he'll be the best husband that ever was seen. If he's half as good as Roger --oh Ruth--you ought to be happy." 

 "So I am." 

 "No, you're not--not wildly--not as happy as he deserves. I don't think you're even content to sit still and allow yourself to be loved. What is it, Ruth? Once I used to think you were in love with Dick Maitland; but, thcn, he was so evidently head over ears in love with you that----" 

 "Oh, nonsense, Dully, I've told you be- 

 fore." 

 "I don't care what yon told me before, dear. Women always tell lies about their love affairs one way or the other, and I be- lieve the evidence of my own eyes. Roger was always in love with me, I know, in a cheerful sort of way; but, Dick Maitland well, Dick Maitland--I have often thought of it since--was just heart-brokenly in love with you." 

 "Oh, Dolly, don't." 

 "What, crying? Don't cry, dear, don't cry; there wipe your eyes. You're not bound to marry a man however in love he is with you if you don't want to, and both Roger and I would much rather you married Alick Finlayson. You don't love him. Ah, but you like him, and esteem him so much that yon will be sure to love him in time. I don't see how a woman can help loving a good husband, and he will be the best husband in the world to you. There--there's my naughty boy waking up and crying for his mother. Ruth, as soon as you're done, write to Moubray's for that longcloth." 

 CHAPTER XVIII. 

 THE FOREST FIRE. 

 Ruth wrote for the longcloth, and imme- diately the two young women set to work. Roger smiled at his wife's energy, and used to ask her it she was sure the farm did not suffer, but she only laughed, and declared she hadn't a sister to marry every day, and every- thing must give place to the all-important trousseau if Ruth adhered to her plans and insisted on being married in the second week in February. Christmas passed, and the New Year came ushered in by a heat greater even than usual in an Australian summer. Marsden-man, after the manner of his kind, had taken a fortnight's holiday, but his employer went every day to work clearing on the other side ot the selection, and the two women were left at their work undis- turbed. 

 Marsden used to read to them every even- ing as they sewed, and all Christmas Day and New Year's Day he spent playing with his boy and lolling on the sofa watching 

 them. 

 "It's quite refreshing to see your in- dustry," he said. 

 "It's rather hard on you, I think though," said Ruth. "Two of your holidays have been completely spoiled by our energy." 

 "Oh, Roger doesn't mind, do you Roger? He likes reading to us in the evenings, and I only worked on New Year's Day because I intend to have a real holiday on the 6th. We shan't do a thing that we can help that day --and Roger, you must stop at home from work, won't you, all day long?" 

 "Waste a whole day?" he asked. 

 "Our wedding day and baby's birthday?" she said with a little anxious quiver in her 

 voice. 

 "Why, of course, my darling," he hastened to reassure her, "I never dreamt of doing anything else. That is the feast of St. Dolly, you know Ruth, and must be kept 

 with all due reverence." 

 But Dolly did not have her husband on her wedding day after all. 

 On the evening of the 5th he rode over to the little post-office five miles away as usual, and came back with a rather vexed look on his face. 

 "I'm so vexed, wife," he said, "so sorry, but I'm afraid I'll have to go over to Crafer's to-morrow. Here's old Atkinson writes to say he's got a buyer for the wood, a man who buys to sell again in the Melbourne market. He thinks he'll take it all off my hands at a fair price. It'll bring about �40 he thinks, but he's arranged for me to meet this man at his place to-morrow." 

 "Oh dear," sighed Dolly, "oh dear, that is hard, and we can't afford to miss such a chance, can we? Of course, you must go. Ruth and I will think of you all the same, and we'll get on with our sewing better than ever, because we've been so careful not to leave anything we could help to be done to- 

 morrow." 

 "And I wanted to stay, but we can't afford 

 to lose this chance." 

 Nevertheless next morning at 6 o'clock when Roger ought to have started on his journey he felt himself very unwilling to go. Both Ruth and Dolly were up to give him his breakfast and see him off, and Dolly in honour of her f�te day had put on a new 

 dress. 

 The breakfast was dainty and the table was prettily decorated with flowers freshly gathered, even though it was so early. 

 "By Jove," said Marsden, "I don't expect there's another man in all the district round has such a pretty home and such a charming wife and sister to wait on him." And he threw an appreciative glance round the table as he helped himself to some more salad. 

 "And you're going to have such a day," sighed his wife. "Just hark to the wind." 

 Indeed it was a fierce hot-wind day, as they found when they came out together a few minutes later--he to saddle his horse, she to look on and see as much of him as she could. Though it was barely 6 o'clock the sun was like a bull of fire in a copper-coloured sky, and the mighty north wind came raging through the gum-trees, tearing at their branches, tossing up their bark as it rushed roaring away to the sea. 

 "Now, you two girls, be good, and don't got into any mischief while I'm away. I'll be buck by 7 or 8," and he mounted his horse, and waving his hand to them, rode away, and was soon lost to sight amongst the surround- ing trees' trunks. 

 "Poor Dolly," said Ruth, sympathetic- ally. 

 Dolly laughed. 

 "If I never have any greater trouble I'll be lucky, shan't I? Come along, Ruth. We ought to make rapid strides in your t rousseau --why, its only just after 6. Let's have a cup 

 of tea, and then set to work." 

 Dolly felt rather low-spirited, so they 

 worked on in silence till about 7, when Roger junior wakened, and his mother bathed him and dressed him in his little white shirt only for coolness sake, and after giving him his breakfast, set him on the floor 

 to amuse himself. But baby, usually so good, was cross and fretful, and again and again his mother had to put down her work and take him in her arms and soothe him. 

 "Poor little chap, it's the heat," said his aunt. "Give him another bath. Here Gretehen, bring in a bucket of water will you, please." 

 The girl brought in a pail of water a minute or two later, cool and fresh from the well, and, pouring it into the baby's bath, stopped a moment and looked at the boy splashing 

 about in it. 

 "There is smoke outside," she remarked 

 solemnly. 

 "Smoke, is there?" said Dolly, "I hope to goodness the brushwood won't take fire and burn the fences like it did last year." 

 "I think it will," observed her handmaid, and her mistress sighed, 

 "What a nuisance! Well, we couldn't do 

 anything against a wind like this. The fences 

 will have to go," and she went on playing with 

 her baby, who had stopped crying, and was thoroughly enjoying himself. 

 "Don't you think there's any danger," asked Ruth, when Gretcben had gone back to 

 the kitchen. 

 "What of? Of the house catching? Oh, no, there's a clearing all round. Last year all the scrub was burnt, and a lot of the fencing, too, but it didn't come near the house. It's hard luck, though--30s. a week for a fencer, and as soon as the fences are up they get burnt down again. Look at baby; he's good enough now. I expect he'll go to sleep again 

 when I take him out." 

 But Baby Roger was by no means disposed to be amiable when his mother did take him out of his bath, and he cried and protested still more vehemently when she tried to lay him down to sleep. So she lay down on her own bed beside him and took him on her arm, and when Ruth peeped in softly half an hour after both mother and child were sound asleep, 

 The blinds were down both in the sitting room and in the bedroom, and it was com- paratively cool and dark, and Ruth, taking her sister's seat in the rocking-chair, sewed on contentedly for some time. Then the door opened, and Grctchcn stood there, look- ing rather frightened. 

 "Oh, Miss Grant," she said, "do look here a minute, please." 

 "Hush," said Ruth. "Mrs. Marsden and baby arc both asleep." And she followed her softly into the kitchen. "What's the matter?" she asked. 

 For all answer the girl pointed to the window, and Ruth saw thick clouds of smoke, driven by the fierce hot wind, rushing past, hiding from sight even the fence that surrounded the garden. 

 "Good gracious," she cried, rubbing her eyes, as it they might have deceived her, "why Gretchcn, is it smoke?" 

 "Smell it," said the girl laconically, and indeed the air was redolent of the strong aromatic smell of the burning gum leaves. "Oh miss," she added, "it's an awful 

 fire." 

 Ruth opened the door, and the two women peered out. The little yard was thick with smoke, and the wind was roaring through the tree-tops so that they could hardly hear one another speak. Snatching up a tea cloth from the dresser, Ruth put it over her head and, followed by Grctchcn, made her way across the yard to the slip panels. The sky was heavy and overcast, whether by the clouds or by the smoke they could not tell, the air was thick and heavy with it, and, leaning over the slip-rails they could see nothing but smoke like a fog, shutting out even the tree trunks. Two or three wallaby rushed past seemingly too terrified to notice their proximity, and a tiny bandicoot leapt under the rails and took refuge in Gretchen's dress. 

 "Oh, Miss," she cried, "that's the worst sign, I've heard my father say. We'll be burnt up if we don't run," and she made as if she would have started off there and then. 

 Ruth laid her hand on her arm. 

 "Wait a minute. We must tell Mrs. Marsden," and she rushed into the bedroom where mother and child were still sleeping peacefully. 

 "Dolly! Dolly! darling!" she cried, snatching up the boy. "Oh, Dolly!" 

 Dolly sat up rubbing her eyes. "Why, Ruth, what is it?" 

 "Fire, dear! The whole forest is on 

 fire!" 

 Dolly was on her feet, and at the door in a moment. They knew little enough nbout it any one of the three, but a glance was sufficient to show Dolly her sister was right. This was no ordinary brush fire, but a raging conflagration, sweeping all before it. The house, the outbuildings--all were of wood with shingle roofs, now dry as tinder-- a spark would set them alight, and the fire would be roaring on them in less than half 

 an hour. 

 She wrung her hands. "Oh, Ruth, Ruth." 

 "Dear, you know the country best, 

 which----" 

 "Down to Mitchell's," put in Gretchen; "quick, get baby and let's run." 

 "But the animals, we can't leave them," sobbed Dolly, "Oh, Roger, Roger." 

 "Hush, dear. There, I've opened the hen- house door. You let the old hen out of the coop. Now the pigs--we'll leave the stye open--and, Gretchen, Gretchen, catch Mug- gie." 

 They rushed about in hopes of giving every living thing a chance of life, and Dolly opened the cage door and let her canary go free. It fluttered round helplessly, and finally perched on the verandah just out of 

 reach. 

 "It's no good," panted Dolly, "we must save ourselves. We'd belter put on our ulsters, or the sparks may catch our 

 dresses." 

 In the bedroom little Roger was sitting on the floor just where his aunt had left him, crying quietly to himself. His mother, after 

 putting on a heavy winter cloak, wrapped a blanket round him. Then she found that a heavy boy of twelve months old wrapped in a blanket was as much as she could manage, and returned to the sittingroom, 

 where her sister and maid, also in their ulsters, were putting anything that seemed to them valuable into their pockets and into two pillow cases in hasty preparation for de- parture, while on the doorstep the household magpie, still uncaught, was dancing up and down calling shrilly-- 

 "What's the matter? What's the matter? What the devil's the matter?" 

 "Oh, poor Mag," cried Dolly, and Gretchen made a sudden dart and caught the bird, and, evading a vicious peck, put him in her ulster pocket and buttoned it down over him, where he relieved his feelings by crowing like the farmyard cock and using up all his 

 voluminous and somewhat profane vocabu- lary in unavailing protest against his cramped 

 quarters. 

 It was not ten minutes since Gretchen had called Ruth, but the smoke was growing thicker, and thicker, and breathing was 

 absolutely difficult. 

 "We must start," said Ruth, and Dolly 

 sobbed-- 

 "Oh dear, I do hope there's nothing left alive and shut up that I've forgotten." 

 "The fire's quite close," cried Ruth, as another gust of wind threatened to lift the 

 roof from the house, and the three women rushed out and fled before the north wind, down the garden and through the forest, the 

 magpie in Gretchen's pocket shrieking wildly, and the boy in his mother's arms sobbing with fright. Straight before the wind they ran, right through the forest; there was not even a track to guide them, and the smoke was blinding now. Round this great tree, 

 under that heavy branch, across these rough logs, and always it seemed to their excited 

 imaginations that the f�re was close behind them. 

 About a mile and half from the homestead, just after they had left tho boundary fence, 

 they came to a creek, which cut right across 

 their path; the banks were rather steep, and 

 its bed was broad, though the heat had re- duced the water to the merest trickle, and in no place did it come higher than their 

 ankles. They scrambled down the banks, 

 walked through the water, which was cool and refreshing to their hot feet, and struggled 

 up the opposite side. Then they paused a 

 moment to take breath, and looked back the way they had come. There was nothing much to see; the wind was as high and the smoke as thick as ever, but still, though the smell of the burning gum leaves was so strong, 

 there was no sign as yet of the fire. 

 Dolly sat down for a moment on a log to rest. The boy was heavy, the heat stifling, and they had come the mile and a half in less than five-and-twenty minutes. 

 "The creek will stop the fire, Ruth," she

 Dolly pushed her hands aside and rose to 

 her feet.
