LAKE IdttJMDt (From our own Correapoadeafc.) Lake Masai, April 20. with the exception of & bashflre here And there, whioh luckily did no damage to homesteads or atook, nothiug of in terest has happened beta for some time past. It has been a very dry Bummer, so dry in faot that the Black Plain was totally dried up. Tha " oldest resident" has not seen this happen before, at least to my knowledge, at all events. On the evening of the Xlth inst. Aleaaadee MaoOalman was married to Annie, second oldest daughter of Mr. Robert Vinen, the Rev, D. A. Sonter officiating. After the oeremony, an adjournment was made to the sohool house, where a wedding breakfast was in waiting. About 50 guests sat down, and the usual courtesies and congratulations were exohanged. The room was oleared later on, and the danoers took their places. A most enjoyable evening waa thus spent by young and old alike j and they would not oare how soon another V7edding Game along on suoh liberal terms as that afforded by their host and hostess. Varied presents were on view that gave token of many friends and welUwishers. What might have been a dreadful death ooourred here one day last week. A young man having run down an etna rushed up to embraoe his prtae, Although deprived of speed, the animal still had a "rick" left in him, with whioh he managed to disfigure my friend's face for the time being. He tells me that he had a mlraoulous esoape, and that it was fortunate for him he had been at olose quarters endeavouring to get his full Nelson on, or there is no telling what the oonsequenoes might have been, Only a kiok from a horse 01 a blow from a prisa-fighter oould have done more damage had he been at the proper range he states.
