TUMBARUMBA. (From Our Own Correspondent.) Tuesday, Jan. 3. Reports to hand show that the ravages of the recent bush fires has been more disastrous than was at first thought. The fire spread from the Alfredtown and Ger- manton districts across Tarcutta, Carabost, Billabong, Humula, and Rosewood, carry- ing devastation in all directions. Home- stead after homestead was razed to the ground, sheep were burnt to death in hun- dreds, whilst dairy herds and farm horses went mad with fright and died by leaping into the flames. Whole families are re- ported to have sought refuge from the flames by standing upright in the creeks and lagoons. At Rosewood the fire seems to have exhausted itself but not until a number of farmers and landholders had completely lost their crops, grass and stock, whilst Mr. Joe Antone and Mr. Keogh, senr. had their homes burnt to the ground ; in each case not an atom could be saved, stock, house, furniture, clothes, and money all being destroyed. As far as I can learn the greatest sufferers on Humula were Messrs. J. Woodhouse, Clyde, Mott, Wil- son, and others. Billabong, the residence of Mr. Jack M'Laurin is reported to have been burnt down, as well as the smaller farm houses of that locality. Reports from Billapalap and Lower Bago are equally dis- tressing, and I have just been reliably in- formed that not a vestige of Mr. Harry Lucas's home is now in existence. All telegraph communication is cut off between here and other towns, owing to the line between here and Adelong having been destroyed ; so a full estimate of the disaster cannot be procured.
