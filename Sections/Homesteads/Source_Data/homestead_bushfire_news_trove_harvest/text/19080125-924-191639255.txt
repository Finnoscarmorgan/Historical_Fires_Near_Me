Bushflres on Kangaroo Island. CROSSING A BURNING BRIDGE. During last week the great heat was intensified by the outbreak of bushfires on portions of Kangaroo Island, owing to which about 150 square miles oi scrub country was burnt. The honcficial south wind, hnwo-Vf1/, which came up Sunday nijjil jjrajually extinguished the fires. Mr Frank Ayliffe, of Karatta Station, who, accompanied by Colonel Dean and his sou, left the homestead at G o'clock on Sunday evening en route for Kingscots, met with an experience which lent a certain amount of variety to the trip. They started off in a vehicle drawn by a four horse team and, on reaching the bridge over the Eleanor River, found that it was burning at one side. After a short debate it was decided to take the horses out and pull the vehicle across first. This was done and. three of the horses were then lead across one by one. The fourth animal, however, refused to go, and the travellers had to lead it along the bauk of the stream in search of a crossing. Ultimately they crossed the quadruped. On re turning to the bridge they found that the structure had fallen through and it was made plain to the travellers that had it not been for the refusal of the fourth horse to cross it would have gone down with the bridge. Mr Ayliffe states that the fires presented a magnificent spectacle. One swept past the Karatta Station homestead only tnissuig it by about 100 yards. *
