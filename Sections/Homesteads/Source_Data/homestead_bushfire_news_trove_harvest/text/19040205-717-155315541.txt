THE AGRICULTURIST. BUSH FIRES AND STUBBLE BURNING. By II. Pye. (Published by Arrangement with the Victorian Department of AgriciU ture.) In writing these few notes on bush fires and stubble burning, it is ap parent that .some matters of interest might be drawn attention to, which would have a practical bearing in re gard to rural economy. Also it is likely that farmers, when they burn their stubble, are not, as a rule, aware of the comparative losses and gains to the land due to following this prac tice, which is every year becoming more general. The bush fires in Vic toria, and of the other States of the Commonwealth, often cause great loss to farmers, both directly and indirect lv Tile Hireet lnfc«fiy )iri- nri nci mi 1 lv the burning of the pasture grasses, crops, fences, homes, and occasional ly some of the stock The indirect losses do not appear to the farmer of much consequence, yet on investigat ing them it will be apparent that they may be serious, as for instance, ow ing to the destruction of insectivor ous birds. The loss of forest seedlings and many old forest giants in timber re serves, is often very great. These re serves are rapidly diminishing, and even the firewood supplies of large cities are every year being obtained from more; distant parts. In order to safeguard the interests of farmers and' graziers, laws have been passed in or der to check the frequency of bush fires; but in spile of this, they are more genera! than they should be The supreme indifference of some per sons to fires is very exasperating to those who know what direful results may follow when they occur, hence, smoking should strongly he discoun tenanced, and even made a misde meanor, if it takes place anywhere where there is a possibility of a spark falling on the grass. Pernaps if graz iers and farmers, whose properties lie in the route of swagtnen, were to make suitable provision and encourage the swagmen and others to boil their bil lies in places prepared for such pur poses, there might, be some hope of fewer fires. The use of wax matches should also be discouraged, as there is no doubt that they are the cause of more fires than is generally thought . Doubtless there is 110 economical method of clearing timbered country that, is far from a large city, except by burning It is a pity that such is the case, nut it is inevitable. In countries where the trees shed their leaves every year, the land receives much organic matter; and this, toge ther with the earth, forms a rich layer of soil that will grow almost any farm crop Old grass, too, supplies organ ic matter to the soil, and renders it more absorbent for moisture, while it also induces a better retention of it The presence of fliis organic matter repairs the soil for the increase of bacterial life so necessary for induc ing fertility in soils: thus grass fires, especially, are not only the cause of much direct, loss to the stock- owners, hut the burnt grass represents a loss of much organic matter that has tak en a considerable time to he extracted from the air and soil. The mineral matter alone is left, whilst the re mainder passes away in a gaseous form, with the exception of a little charcoal that may not he completely burnt away. The fire, if a severe one, destroys a good deal of beneficial bac terial life, and frequently there is nolle too much of this in the greater number of our soils, hence one cause, and a prominent one. for infertility. Certain'y it may become rather mys tifying. knowing this, to determine what should be done when there is a large area of coarse grass on a grazing run. As a rule, it is found more eco nomical to burn it off, and look to the young sweet growth as a recom pense Tf the latter he cut early en ough. it would likely make a second class ensilage, but this presupposes that the land is sufficientfv clear for the carrying out of the work, and that labour is available It would be ad visable to endeavour, as soon as pos sible. to replace the coarse grasses by the finer kinds, and so reduce the ne cessity for horning off In the north ern parts of the State there is rarelv much of this grass, as these heavily stocked areas are so well grazed by sheep that the old jjrass is useful for a time in protecting the young shoots coming through. In some parts the grass and scrub are burnt in order to destroy ticks and other parasites. Mow far this is successful is a moot point ; theoretically, however, the loss of organic matter is an important matter; but left to natural condition* the decay of vegetable matter is so slow that it is necessary in some in stances to burn off the coarse herbage at regular intervals, unless paper mills were close at hand, when it would pay to cut the grass. Fre quently it is the burning off of these areas lhat starts many severe bush fires,- since insufficient precautions are taken to keep the fires well under con trol In regard to the finer class of grasses, the old growth is the natural protection of the young growth from irost, and when it decays each year, acts as a natural mulch and seed bed The better the pasture grasses (he more reason that, even when dry. they should be preserved from fires, irre \j i 1 1 j v- 1 1 unci nil tor MUCK during the summer and autumn. The burning of the stubble after stripping is certainly a retrogade movement on farms, as it is so much energy misdirected or lost to the farm, only mineral matter is left, which pri marily has been obtained from the soil, and is simply returned to it as a light top dressing. All the organic matter so needful to our soils, and whose absence is. without doubt, one of the chief causes of infertility in many instances, passes into the air from which it came. This act of burn ing, practically speaking, means that the plants, after their season's work, leave only a few ashes drawn from the soil, also the roots, to show for it. The stored-up energv has been dissi pated, and has passed to other chan nels, but the soil gains little in com parison to what it should There is no doubt but that our wheat areas are rapidly losing their fertility from the absence in the soil of this organic matter. It is interesting to unravel tho skein of mystery that we see be fore us every day in our crops, and to ask seriously, is it right that we should burn our stubble? Do we real ly cheapen the cost of farming, or is it an ephemeral practice that will leave us sadly disappointed in the end? There is no doubt but that strip ping is a wasteful method when car ried out systematically, and can only be excused when lack of capital forces a man to choose this methoa of harvest ing. A farmer who keeps stock should not, if possible, resort to it as a gen eral practice: the unreliability of the labour market, and the absolute ne cessity for reducing current expenses, forces the farmer to do many things that he would not attempt, otherwise, and one of these is stripping. Never theless. the practice is not a good one. and this has been exemplified during the drought this year, since straw is so scarce over the northern parts of Victoria. Great as the loss of straw ' for stock, a still greater loss is that felt bv the land of organic matter, and whether this is supplied by green manuring, stable manure, or from straw rotted in the piggeries, byres, or Bmall yards, or by cattle eating it from the gtacka iu the out-field, the same general results are derived. There is one thing certain, our wheat growing area is less able to retain and absorb moisture, is drier iu dry weather, more sloppy in wet weather, and colder during the winter and spring than it would be if sufficient organic matter were present. We find that light dressings of fertilisers give more economical returns, firstly, be cause the light rainfall, and partly be cause the amount of humus present in the soil is, as a rule, too small. Al so, thorough cultivation is not gen eral, thus the texture of the soil is not conducive to the retaining of moisture, and the application of heav ier dressings of fertilisers At present there is no need to expand on this matter, but it is necessary to show that the straw burnt is a real loss to the farmer. The chief advantages gained by burn ing the stubbies are: 1\. Cheapness and rapidity of har vesting. 2\. Reducing the amount of humus iu soils already too rich in it. 3\. Destroying fungus and insect pests. The following are some of the dis advantages: — 1\. Loss of humus or organic matter, which applies to most soils. 2\. Loss of nitrogen. 3\. Loss of beneficial bacterial life. ?1. Absence of straw during winter and droughty seasons. In order to check bush fires from carrying all before them, if some head lands be cultivated and kejit free from weeds, and then about October be sown down with broom corn or sor ghum, a good fire break would be at tiand, whilst after harvesting the crop, the stock put on the stubbles would have a good bite of green feed, or the broom corn could be marketed if the libre were a good sample. Every farmer who has a valuable stack of hay, or wheat, is careful to have a fire break around them, as well as around his homestead and build ings. Such simple precautions are often the means of saving much valu able property from destruction, es pecially if a few beating appliances are kept handy. There are a number of preparations for rendering canvas and sacking more or less fire- proof, one being: — Boracic acid, 31bs; salammoniac, 7J lbs; borax, li lbs; water, 5 gallons. For wearing apparel or bedding, an ounce of alum, borax, or salammon iac, dissolved in the last water in which the fabrics are rinsed, renders them less likely to catch fire, whilst the ordinary water glass used by the farmers for preserving eggs, if paint ed over boards, renders them to some extent fire-proof, so also does a mix ture of sulphate of ammonia and sul phate of lime. Most farmers have had experience of bushfires, and it will be generally admitted, that during those times the sterling neighbourly worth of every individual farmer is very pronounced. It is astonishing the long distances that recruits to the band of firsfight ers come, and they work hard and long, yet how much the better would their assistance be if better organisa tion and better methods of fighting the lire were known.
