THE CRITIC. Who can undaunted brave the Critic's rage ? Or note unmoved his mention in the Critic's page ? Parade his errors in the public eye ? And Mother Grundy's rage defy ? Clem Hill is the only cricketer in the world who has made three score of over 300 runs. * * * It was plaintively asked some time ago "if it was Toby." But now "it is not Toby." * * * Neither Irishman nor Roman Catholic was empanelled on the jury which aquitted Abigail. * * * Experts say the German Arch at the corner of College and Oxford streets is the best piece of work on paper. * * * Where are the starving poor to be fed, and what are they to be feasted on during the Federal festivities ? * * * Police advice to the public : Wear no jewellery while the great procession and Federal pomp are afoot. * * * If Wriggler Reid's polotical weight was anything like his 21-stone scale register, what a power he might be. * * * It was a very cross examination indeed—that of some of the witnesses in the Coningham-O'Haran case. * * * The thieves and house- breakers Commwealth corroboree campaign will be celebrated in the suburbs. * * * Private detectives play the game very low down when they swear to affidavits and declarations in false names. * * * "A court converted into a circus, with George Reid as clown"—the utterance of a disgusted listener at the Abigail trial. * * * Pickpockets will be as much in evidence on the 1st prox. As swagger uniforms, though not so conspicuous as the latter. * * * Every second returned swaddie one meets claims to have a hunk of the flag that braved the battles and seige of Kimberly. * * * Seriously suggested by someone that the marital cause Coningham v. Coning- ham should be tried before a jury of Jews. * * * Said that all the members of the first Federal Ministry will be knighted for the New Year and the Premier raised to the Privy Council. * * * A most appropriate name to a Sydney demi-monde is Joy. One owning to that name was dealt with at one of the police courts the other day. * * * Why did the Democratic Arch want Lyne to be Federal Premier ? It has been sug- gested that E. W. would make an ideal State Premier. * * * The want of sufficient portfolios to satisfy all cravings will be the biggest trouble in Cabinet- making in connection with the Com- monwealth. * * * Parliament House refreshment-rooms has been suggested as a suitable place to feed 200 starving families during the first week in January. * * * Why, it will cost quite £20,000 to repair the streets and pull down the gim- crackery arches and grandstands after the Federal fizzle ! * * * The coming celebrations and the devastating bush fires will paralyse the people in many country places. All the coin is being centred in Sydney. * * * Signor Hazon goes to Italy to get together a first-class opera company for Mr. J. C. Williamson. Theatrical affairs show signs of a boom in Australia. * * * TRUTH among the papers and E. W. O'Sullivan among politician of the first rank were alone in tipping Sir William Lyne for the first Federal Premiership. * * * Coogan's face was one of many hues—somewhat kaleidoscopic—while George Reid had him under cross- examination in the trial of Ernest Robert Abigail. * * * Fears are entertained by the Domain dossers that they will have to be content with soup kitchen tickets on which to enthuse their patriotism during the celebrations. * * * One daily paper says the reception of Lord Hopetoun was "a most memorable spectacle." Now just fancy our Governor- General making a spectacle of himself. * * * This Federal Cabinet will possibly be made up of Sir William Lyne, Sir George Turner, Mr. John See, Mr. Deakin, Mr. Dick- son, Mr. Kingston and Sir John Forrest. * * * It is proposed to increase the Go- vernor- General's screw to £20,000. If that is done what is the use of our so-called Federal Constitution ? It will be badly "busted." * * * Toby Barton, it is said, declined to join the Lyne Federal Ministry. Of course it remains to be seen who the Federal Chief Justice will be. Will Barton decline that ? * * * British soldiers, coming out by the Britannic to the Federal festivities complain of being kept thirsty on the voyage. They will not have that to trouble them when they land. * * * A sample of George Reid's wit on Crown Prosecutor Merewether rising to "object" in the Abigail case : "Good Heavens What's this apparition ?" Roars of laughter. * * * Champion Pug Fitzsimmons is doing the States as an actor in the "Honest Black- smith." If there is any striking to be done, Bob ought to be at home in more ways than one. * * * Reports from many country towns show that the returned swaddies are demora- lised, and have degenerated from good husband- men into flash popinjays, who scorn to return to the plough. * * * Our "Juggernaut" has been busy lately mangling the citizens. Is there another city in the world where, to the percentage of population, so many awful tram accidents occur as in Sydney ? * * * The refusal of Mr. Barton to join Sir William Lyne's Federal Ministry is said to be the first instance on record of Australia's Noblest Foi letting go a chance of drawing fees from the State. * * * Those who have been hanging on to Mr. Barton during the last few months in the hope of Federal favors can now scarcely conceal their chagrin at the reflection that so much time has been wasted. * * * All along Oxford-street scaffolds are being erected for procession grandstands. At Darlinghurst the Governor is having a stand all to himself. But he will mount it too late to view the pageant. * * * Said that Victorian Roman Catho- lics, dissatisfied with the result of the Coning- ham-O'Haran trial are willing to subscribe to the petitioner's costs if he sets down the case again for hearing. * * * "The Sydney Sportsman's" strictures on cronk racing have caused the stoppage of credit to several stables by the horse feed mer- chants. Trainers and owners admit their game is nearly at an end. * * * Can anybody tell us what it will cost to feed and accommodate 1000 English soldiers and all the N.S.W. bandsmen who are to go under canvas on the Agricultural Society's Grounds for a week ? * * * It was said that Lord Hopetoun had been ding up Australian politics before sending for the Federal Premier. Probably one of his guides was TRUTH'S open letter addressed to him last Sunday ! * * * "Were you drunk ?" was asked of an inebriate lately at one of our police courts. "I suppose I was," added the drunk, "or else I wouldn't be here." Which reply, on the whole, is really philosophical. * * * The Postmaster-General must stick to his task of blocking the quacks using and abusing the G.P.O. Quantities of filthy litera- ture are still going into the country and other colonies from this city. * * * Mr. George Reid, who is perhaps tired of the yes-no attitude, is anxious for a straight fiscal issue under Federation, and therefore rejoices in the accession of Sir William Lyne to the Premiership. * * * Mr. B. R. Wise put all his money on the favorite, Barton, for the Federal Premier- ship Stakes, and when the result of the race was announced he nearly fainted, and then rushed off to Melbourne. * * * It is not likely, after the hardships and cruel treatment of Australian soldiers in the Transvaal, that Lord Kitchener's appeal for fresh contingents of mounted troops will meet with any ready response. * * * The man who is unfortunate enough to damage a bobby's pantaloons should never forget that he is liable to be considered a sedi- tious person, because the pantaloons are the property of Her Gracious. * * * Kruger has accepted the freedom of the city of Limerick. Only recently he refused the freedom of the city of London and of the Island of St. Helena offered him by "Bobs." Kruger is getting reconciled. * * * A big wool firm in Sydney is said to be the worst lot of sweaters in Australia. They pay their clerks just enough for an existence, and work them all hours. Why does the Early Closing Act not apply to clerks ? * * * The Royal Agricultural Society has a nice soft thing on in giving up the grounds to the British and Indian troops. It will make more money out of the Celebrations than was ever dreamt of in anybody's philosophy. * * * The 17,000 guests invited to take part in the Commonwealth fireworks, will cost the colony far more than the total amount (C',000) already set apart as enough to cover the whole expense of the Federal shivoo. * * * Roman Catholic men of Wagga to the number of between 60 and 70 have passed resolutions affirming their entire belief in the nnocence of Dr. O'Haran, and offering him monetary assistance to meet his expenses. * * * Henry Jam s (Grimshaw), the pri- vate D., says his name is really Grimshaw. We fancy we have seen that name in some of the yellow backs and blood and thunder stories in he magazines and other detective yarns. Why should the Government be asked to give £200 towards the Coal Arch ? The coal kings are surely rich enough to stack a few chunks of coal, one upon the other, without asking assistance. Nice patriotism, indeed ! * * * Reporter Magill, who was removed from the Victorian Assembly on Tuesday night by the Speaker in mistake for a stranger, is one of the oldest journalists in that colony. The Speaker publicly apologised for the mistake. * * * Said that the "Press" dinner, which is to be the finale of the Commonwealth drunk and gorge, will be restricted to toney members. The ordinary journalistic hack and the unassuming news-grubber will be pressed out. * * * At Randwick they are going to form social club for the use of stable lads. The club will be provided with a library, but, in deference to public opinion, not with a gym- nasium for working up Johnny Armstrong's biceps. * * * Wriggler Reid eclipsed all his pre- vious performances in criminal work in his masterly handling of the Abigail case. His cross-examination was magnificent. No point was missed, and nothing worth following up was neglected. * * * The Federal elections campaign started in Cobar the other day, when Messrs. Ferguson and Spence, Ms.L.A., opened out. A terrific duststorm opened at the same time, and yet, says an exchange, the speeches were interesting ! * * * London "Standard" states that Mr. Donald McDonald's book, describing the siege of Ladysmith, is incomparably the best account of the siege yet published. Australian war cor- respondents, on the whole, scored pretty well during the war. * * * An Albury solicitor, whilst travelling on the express from Albury to Wagga last week, fell off the platform of a corridor car, and, be- yond being bruised and shaken, was com- paratively unhurt. The devil always looks after his own brigade. * * * Sir John Downer came to Sydney to await a call from Mr. Barton to join his first Federal Ministry. He now feels sore at Sir William Lyne's success—as sore as a man who prepares a banquet to mark a triumph which does not come off. * * * Earl Hopetoun's visiting book was opened at Government House on Saturday morning. On Saturday evening the first three names appearing on its pages were those of Sir Thos. Fitzgerald (of Melbourne), Cardinal Moran and Dr. O'Haran. * * * The troopers of the returned Austra- lian Horse admit the truth of the rumor that lots were drawn for the selection of two of their number to shoot a certain officer. On all hands his conduct in the field is condemned as brutal, callous and cowardly. * * * There will not be much Federal festivity down in the Riverina where scores of unhappy farmers have had their crops and homesteads ravaged by bush fires. A few thousands might be saved from the Sydney guzzle for their help. * * * George Reid has a marked card up his sleeve anent the Federal-Premiership. He supports Lyne as provisional Premier in order to discredit Barton, hopeful of topping the Federal poll himself and claiming the honor by virtue of a majority vote. * * * The Abigail-Coogan case was made very amusing by Mr. Reids flippancies. He got as good as he gave from one witness, however, who, pestered on some point or other, retorted, "Anyhow, I have given you a straight answer, not a yes-no one." * * * In the Stirling (Vic.) divorce suit the wife admitted staying in a cottage at Warr- nambool with the co-respondent over night, but "nothing improper happened." The Court was not chivalrous, but stared hard, and wifie had a decree nisi declared against her. * * * Darlinghurst is the Ghetto of Sydney. In Maclay-street and other fashion- able thoroughfares of that district two house- holders out of three are Hebrews. Were it not for the big population in the Gaol the Christians would be seriously outnumbered. * * * Foreigners prefer Australia to their native lands. Signor Hazon, the brilliant con- ductor, speaking with "The Critic" on Wednes- day last,was almost offended when asked if he meant to return to Sydney. "Coming back ? I should think so, and very soon, too." * * * Dr. Stirling, of Melbourne Divorce Court fame, was the medico who tried to pull wrestler Clarence Whistler together when the latter broke up his immense strength and con- stitution by debauchery and drink following upon his victory over Professor Miller. * * * Railway Signalman, Forshaw de- nies absolutely that he ever applied to haughty headquarters for four months' leave to visit his aged mother at the Isle of Jersey, which request was declined. The facts in our last Sunday's par. on this subject were misinterpreted. * * * Mr. G. H. Reid, Q.C., in defending lawyer Abigail in the alleged suborning witness- case, asked why Crown Prosecutor Merewether inquired the parentage of Patrick Meagher. Mr. Merewether did not reply, but the reason was obvious. Some of the witnesses for the prose- cution were so "scaley" that the C.P. was anxious to introduce into the case a man of some respectability. H. H. Champion, the brilliant but somewhat injudicious Victorian Protectionist, has commenced a libel suit against made-in- Germany Freetrader Max Hirsch. Champion claims that Hirsch spoiled his election chances for Albert Park at the last Victorian polling. * * * "Hop" is always happy at a banquet. At Hazon's send-off the artist remarked that if he could be convinced the celestial choir would be led by such a conductor, it would be an addi- tional inducement for desiring to go above and sit on a damp cloud twanging a golden harp. * * * Kiddies get but casual care in Australia. On top of a series of burned-to- death infants comes a tale of a four-year-old boy in a Victorian township who "fell asleep in a crop of oats," and was gathered up in a reaper and binder and shockingly cut and mangled. * * * If, as is rumored, Mr. John See joins the Federal Cabinet with Sir William Lyne, Mr. O'Sullivan will become Premier of New South Wales. Such a solution would settle the difficulty of choice between him and Mr. See if the latter remains in State politics. * * * The destruction in the country by bush fires will prevent hundreds of visitors attending Sydney on Commonwealth Day. Poor selectors and farmers ! Burnt out of home and crops, no money and gold being lavished on tin-pot decorations all over Sydney. * * * In all 17,392 premises in the city are stated by the inspectors to be improperly fur- hished in regard to sanitary necessities. The Water and Sewerage Board is powerless to insist upon reform, because Parliament neglected to pass a necessary amending Act last session. * * * France is taking up a very goody- goody attitude on the China loot question, re- turning all property robbed from the Chows. Perhaps she is influenced by the thought that England has done so well on a national platform of sanctimoniousness that she may as well fol- low suit. * * * Lord Salisbury on the Boor war :— "Whatever attitude we assume towards the past, we must remember that on the issue of that great enterprise rests the glory and per- petuity of the British Empire." That looks like an indiscreet admission that the issue of the struggle is still in doubt. * * * It is rumored that many of the "stand" proprietors are much disappointed over the slow way the shekels are coming in for the purchase of seats to witness the Common- wealth procession. There is reported to be more in the press booming of the said procession than meets the average eye. * * * The Congregational Union publishes the four best out of 16 hymns sent in for a Federal hymn competition. In not one of the hymns is there one genuine line of poetry. The Federal ode competition will probably have the some result—the collection of a lot of wishy- washy phrases and poor figures. * * * Donald McDonald, the "Argus" war correspondent, began his career as a re- porter and journalist 17 years ago on the staff of the half-penny evening paper issued from the "Argus" office. When it was bought off by the Melbourne "Herald," Donald was put on the "Argus" staff as a junior reporter. * * * Captain R. R. Thompson, of the Australian Horse, and Major Lee and Captain Cox, of the Lancers, have accepted positions to remain in Africa. It is just as well that Thomp- son and Cox did so, for they would have small chance of retaining their commissions here. Lee, on the other hand, will be warmly wel- comed. * * * This pic - nic - y, pleasure-loving Government proposos to spend £85,000 of the people's money on the purchase of a palatial steam yacht. It impossible that a vessel once belonging to the Khedive of Egypt will be bought, and won't that royal yacht fancy itself dragging Bill Lyne and Wood around the harbor ? * * * A well- known boot-factory proprie- tor of Sydney (known for his extreme religiosity) recently gave his employees a picnic on Satur- day, and docked each one of thom of the wages for the half-day. One apprentice girl lost thus the big sum of fourpence-halfpenny, which the religious proprietor tbought important enough to gather in. * * * The one bad, black feature in the trial of Abigail on a charge of witness suborna- tion was the constant roars of laughter at the witnesses by counsel and the spectators in court. Mr. G. H. Reid was responsible for it all, as he playcd the part of clown and buffoon from first to last. Only once did Judge Rogers threaten to clear the court. * * * The Western Division of New South Wales came up for comment, at the half- yearly meeting of Goldsbrough, Mort and Co., in Melbourne, on Wednesday last. Sir William Zeal said the western part of this colony has suffered terribly through drought. But he didn't say anything about the firm's evictions of the western pioneers. * * * Among the candidates seeking a seat in the Federal Parliament is ex-Judge McFarland, who draws a Government pension of £750. The seat the ex-Judge seeks is down south, where he acted for many years as Judge. Had women a vote, Mr. M'Farland might have a show, but being 76 years of age and tottering and doddering, he may as well save his time and breath. The ex- Judge says—jokingly, of course—that he might stand a show if the friends of those he has sent into penal servitude would not vote against him. If it is true that the Abattoirs are to be closed for a week during the Federal fes- tivities, much hardship will be inflicted by the costly business, for the majority of the popu- lation are sustained on meat, and only a limited number can afford poultry. Besides, all the poultry in Australia would hardly feed Sydney during Commonwealth week. * * * Premier Dick Seddon, of N.Z., who is coming over to the Commonwealth orgie, is said to have in his mind's eye the high intent of wresting from Jawbone Neild the long speech championship. Banquet committees will have to beware of the New Zealand Boanerges, who is accustomed to take up at least two hours when he rises to make a few remarks. * * * The trail of the grotesque is over the Commonwealth carousel in every detail. The triumphal carriages are hired from corpse planters, and when it was decided to give a welcome to Premier Seddon on his visit from Maoriland, the announcement opened : "A number of New Zealanders met last evening at the Sandwich Supply Company's rooms." * * * The worthlessness of 125 paid poli- ticians and 78 Upper House noodles is forcibly illustrated in the Dental Act. Not one of the 208 statesmen saw the absurdity of fixing January 1 as the date for registration. How the newly appointed Dental Board, can't move at all, except to stick the two horns of the dilemma into John See's hide and wake him up a bit. * * * Mr. W. M. Hughes, M.P., has been presented by the people of West Sydney with a purse of 160 sovereigns, which ought to tide him over the Federal elections. Dr. Graham, M.P., in making the presentation, regretted that such marks of public appreciation were bestowed so rarely. But then, the public show its appreciation of the politician by a regular yearly screw. * * * The only adjunct wanted at the Quarter Sessions during the Abigail trial to turn the proceedings into an utter farce, was the use by the Judge of a ruler, to tap the as- sociate on the head now and then. Phil Day's wonderful representation as the Dogs of Venice in the comic opera "Estella," suggested itself very forcibly when Mr. Reid cracked some monstrous jokes. * * * "I'll bet any money the thieves can't take my watch and chain during the celebrations," said an M.P. the other day. This reminds us of a police inspector at the Mel- bourne Exhibition of 1880, who made a bet that nobody could rob him. A chum detective did the trick easily, and the officer was distracted until his 20-guinea timer was returned by the D. the same evening. Moral : Don't blow too much. * * * The custom of the R.C. Church when one of its ministers is suspected in that the culprit charged is required to present himself at Rome and await the decision of the Papal authorities. This course was followed when a charge was laid against Bishop O'Ma- hony, of Armidale. The bishop had to wait two years at Rome to have his case deter- mined, and when honorably acquitted was ap- pointed Bishop of Toronto, Canada. * * * The ferocious Government bull, which was for a little while in Mudgee, when he violently assaulted one man and attempted to kill several others, has again brought himself into public prominence. After he had shed a deal of innocent blood in this colony, the Government had him shipped to Norfolk Island. There he has gored a man to death. The victim of the brute's latest ferocious act was a former resident of Bourke, in this colony. * * * The outraged virtue of the Queens- land Labor Party found full expression (says the "Northern Miner") over the alleged roystering immigrant lasses. After the recent law case it was necessary for the party to make a demon- stration of morality. Probably the case has been exaggerated. The girls were certainly out- side a public-house ; but there are worse places than that. If they had been in the lobbies of the House waiting for some of the Labor mem- bers to finish their legislative duties an inquiry would certainly be necessary. * * * FEDERAL HONORS Bill Lyne, perhaps, would like to be A Dook or Baronet, And scheming See would like to be— Anything that he could get. The fame would rise of B. R. Wise If he got slung an honor ; Australia would be far too small For Sir Danyell O'Connor ; Jack Want, Bruce Smith, and Barton big All surge in loyal fret, And hunger for the toys that gild The British Cabinet. * * * Sir John Downer, Q.C., of South Australia, now on a visit to his father-in-law at North Sydney, is highly indignant at the Premier of New South Wales being entrusted with the task of forming the First Federal Cabinet. Sir John Downer is an old personal friend of "Toby" Barton, and before his mar- riage with Miss Russell was the guest of Toby at North Sydney on his visits to the mother colony, and Toby was always the guest of Sir John Downer when in Adelaide. 'Tis said that Sir John Downer is booked for a Federal Judgeship. * * * Tho bush-fires raging in the south of the colony are no doubt extensive, but in Eyre's Peninsula, S.A., 20 years ago, 60 square miles of mallee scrub were swept off the face of the world in four hours. Homesteads were burning, ponds and lagoons of water boiled, people charred to cinders, and forty miles from the scene of the conflagration the fowls went to roost at 3 p.m., through the darkness caused by the huge volume of smoke intercepting the sun's rays. A steamer 12 miles at sea was set on fire by an enormous shower of burning embers.
