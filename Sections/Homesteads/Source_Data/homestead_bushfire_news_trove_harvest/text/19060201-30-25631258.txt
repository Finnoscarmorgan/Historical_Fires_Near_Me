To the Editor. Sir,--Whilt we all feel for the suf ferers by the disastrons bushfires in Victoria, I hope tbe people of this State do not lose sight of two very sad eases in our midst. I refer to poor Mrs. Abrahams and her seven children, who are left penniless through the sad death of her husband, also Mrs. Thompson, who lost her son. The amounts already subscribed are very small, considering the exigencies of the cases. I think, sir, before any money leaves this State, we should do some thinu for those poor people in their inforseen misfortune. I suggest that the heads of all big departments open subscription lists before these unfortu nate peoplc are forgotten.-Yours, etc., CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME. Leederville, January 29.
