BUSH-FIRE TRAGEDY. PLUCKY RESCUER'S FATE. Beaufort, Sunday. The accident which happened on Friday to Mr A. M. Hannah, of Beaufort, whilst he was assisting to fight the disastrous bush-fire proved fatal, as he died at an early hour to-day. When rescued from the flames Mr. Hannah was lying just outside Stewart's garden gate. No one seems to be very clear as to the manner in which he got into his terrible plight. It is known that he was assisting to fight the fire at the homestead with other men, and that upon hearing Mr. Stewart's two little girls screaming with terror he ran down the garden. The opinion of the other men is that he tripped and fell headlong into the fire, the heavy fall ren dering him unconscious. Being in a comatose condition he was unable to save himself from being burnt. Whilst the excitement of fighting the flames was at its height he was not missed, and was subsequently found in a half-roasted condition by Mrs. Stewart. When seen on Saturday evening, Dr. Jackson, of Beaufort, held very meagre hopes of Mr. Hannah's.re covery. The unfortunate man was practically burnt all over the body, limbs, and face. His injuries were of such a terrible nature that one of his arms was almost roasted. He died on Sunday. Throughout the Beaufort and Skipton districts Mr. Hannah was very popular. He was one of the foundeis of the flourishing Stock yard Hill Coursing Club, and was himself an enthusiastic courser and owner of dogs. He was also an ex pensive exhibitor at agricultural shows. Two of his brothers, Messrs D. R. and T. Hannah, are farmers at Stockyard Hill, where the whole family were brought up. Mr. Hannah contested the last State election for Hampden against Mr. Oman.
