A DISASTROUS BUSH-FIRE. One of the most disastrous bush-fires which has ever taken place in the Clarendon dis- trict since its occupation by a farming popu- lation occurred on Wednesday and Thursday last, the sad result of which is the almost total destruction of all the crops and fencing between a point known as Jinkin's Water- hole and Heath's farm. The area consists of about 2000 or 3000 acres, and is occupied by about 20 or 30 small dairy farmers, who grow occasional patches of potatoes and corn. The principal part of the land however, is kept for grazing purposes, and is subdivided into small paddocks. It is estimated that about 60 miles of fencing have been destroyed by the fire, and to re- place the damage to the fences alone a sum of about £5000 would be required. Alto- gether the loss is said to amount to about £12,000. The whole extent has been clean swept by the fire, and presents to the eye a bald, black expanse of country of dreary and naked desolation. Such was the terror in- spired by the rolling tide of flame as it ad- vanced, that all efforts were paralysed. Indeed no exertion could be of any avail except in the more immediate neighborhood of the little homesteads. It has not been ascertained whether any cattle were lost, except a horse which was seen between two fires, without any possibility of escape, being slowly roasted alive.— Courier.
