IN THE COUNTRY. I NUMEROUS FATALITIES. ten deaths in one town. gloomy outlook for pastor- alists. GRASS DESTROYED AND CROPS'- RUINED. severe bush fires. Reports from the country last night were most discouraging; excessive heat, reaching in many cases to the deadly degree; disas- Lrous busbflres ravaging crops and threaten- ing homesteads; serious want of water en- dangcring the existence of the pastorallsts' flocks and herds. Such was the purport of scores of messages. Bourke, where the average temperature for every day of the present year was 109, and where 10 deaths have occurred from heat, seems to have fared the worst of all the country towns; hut other centres have almost as gloomy tales to tell.
