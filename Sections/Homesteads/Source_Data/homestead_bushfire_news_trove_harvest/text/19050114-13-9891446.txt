THE BUSH FIRES. THE MACEDON OUTBREAK GOVERNMENT COTTAGE THREATENED. SIR REGINALD AND LADY TALBOT SPECTATORS. FIRES NOW UNDER CONTROL. (BY OUR REPORTER) The bush fires which threatened to ravage Macedon and leave the picturesque mount gaunt and blackened are now happily well under control and whilst extensive damage has been done to grass and fencing-many miles of both having disappeared-no loss of life or serious casualties have been re ported Mount Macedon yesterday was enveloped in a heavy haze of smoke, and this, com- bined with the abnormal heat prevailing made the day one of the hottest ever known in the district. The outbreak has been attended with one or two sensational incidents and the im- minent danger of complete destruction to which Government-cottage was subjected on Wednesday night forms rather a thrilling narrative. The cottage is a very old struc- ture and its well dried shingle roof seems almost to invite destruction by fire. The Government house party consisted of His Excellency and Lady Talbot, Captain Fitzpatrick, Captain Buxton and Captain Buchanan, and whilst they had had a trying time during the week the climax was reached on Wednesday afternoon when the advancing flames threatened to overwhelm the vice-regal country residence. Higher up the mountain at the back of the prettily- situated house is a paddock of 40 acres densely overgrown with bracken, fern and timber and from here came the ominous roar of the approaching flames. It was at once seen that the position was a critical one and Sir Reginald Talbot and the members of the staff prepared to meet it. Where possible the roof was saturated with water but owing to the miserable supply this could only be par- tially carried out. All the members of the staff and the servants were vigorously em- ployed in fighting the fire, and considerable apprehension was felt for the safty of the residence. The heat of the approaching fire added to the high temperature of the day, was very great. Precipitate flight seemed to be the only solution of the difficulty as the fire came nearer, and just when it seemed as if the fire would gain the ascendancy a welcome thunderstorm and rain and change of wind set in and all doubts were placed at rest as the fire slowly receded- defeated by the rain and the band of fire beaters, who had worked unceasingly. There is an absolute lack of appliances for fire fighting at the vice-regal country seat and the Department of Public Works, to try and make amends, yesterday de- spatched one of its officers, Mr. Harvey, to Government house, and with him arrived a small fire extinguisher, which might be of some little use in the event of a further outbreak. "Darraweit Heights," where Mrs. Dunbar Hooper and a party of friends are summer- ing came within the circle of the fire, and the first intimation of real danger was sounded from the Upper Macedon Post office by telephone. The messages con- veyed the news at half-past 3 in the after- noon that the house was in possible danger, and that arrangements should be made to prevent the spread. The fire came up to the fences, but the ready improvising of "breaks" kept back the flames. Seeing the danger of Government-cottage, Mrs. Hooper had gone to Lady Talbot to offer her timely shelter, and on return found her own place encircled, but not dangerously. Lady Tal- bot watched the progress of her first Aus- tralian bush-fire from the commanding ter- race of "Darraweit Heights". The residence of Mr. Justice Hood seemed to be in great danger of falling to the flames and there must have been consider- able doubt in the minds of the occupants as to what the issue would be. Had the rain not fallen the general impression is that the beautiful house would have been soon re- duced to ashes. "Darra," the home of Mr. Moorhead, and adjacent to "Darraweit Heights" was early threatened with destruction on Wednesday, but preventive measures taken by the owner two months ago checked the progress of the fire. All the leading residences are however, being closely watched in case of another outbreak. The severity of the outbreaks after Wed- nesdav were minimised by the cutting of a large fire "break" in the vicinity of Govern- ment Cottage, running from Normanby road lo the "Falls" It was thought on Thursday night that the whole of the fires were under proper control, but the sleepless watchers at 4 o'clock yesterday morning noticed that with the change of wind the fires were rapidly gaining ground. The efficacy of the "break" created the day before was at once apparent in stemming the flames. Had not the "break" been in existence the whole of the grass country between Mace- don and Gisborne might have been laid waste by the flames. The top of Mount Macedon and the slopes leading to Wood- end have all been burnt and from that as- pect the mount is a blackened mass. The Government have a fine plantation of 150 acres on Mount Macedon and 8 acres of these fine trees were burned on Wednes- day night. The conflagration when the pine forest - which is high up on the mountain \- was on fire was one of the most magnifi- cent sights ever seen in the district. To Mr Joseph Firth, superintendent of the Stale Nursery, and his band of "beaters," the time was an exceedingly anxious one, and on one occasion, when the fires met, he and his companions were surrounded by flames and only escaped death by a head- long rush. In this case the rain of Wed- nesday night soon finished the fire, but the wise precaution of Mr. Firth of burning '"breaks" in October and Novem- ber last greatly reduced the volume of the outbreak and its consequences. The "breaks," properly carried out, are in every way valuable, but much damage has arisen in this district through indiscreet creation of these fire resisting agents. When the fire was at its height in the pine plantation on Wednesday, the flames were 50ft to 60ft high, and were consider- ably over a chain and a half in width when advancing. There were two distinct lines of fire-one from the New Chum bridge and the other from the Waterfalls- and both seemed to have Government cottage as their objective. A good deal of damage has been done in the district, and a regret- table feature is that much of the good work performed by the Macedon Improvement Association in beautifying the Mount has been swept away. The Prime Minister, Mr G. H. Reid, who has been staying at Macedon, was an interested spectator of the fires, but he was secure from the flames in the lower reaches of "Lilysleaf," in View-road. He had nothing to say with regard to the outbreak. "Cannot give you a line about it," he re- plied in answer to a pointed inquiry.
