BIG FIRE AT MOUNT PLEASANT• Thousands of Acres of Grass Burnt. Mount Pleafi&nf.; February 6. One of the most destructive bushfires ever known in this district broke out to-day on Mr. McBean's Glen D^von Estate, aboat three miles north of the township. A strong north-east wind which blew at the time soon swept the whole of the estate and carried the dimes on through Messrs. J. Norlhridge's, ihc late E. Brice's estate, W. S-idel'e. and H. A. Giles's, right into the township, mauj of the homesteads being saved with great difficulty. The fire was eventually checked at the river, but on the east it went oo through Mr. T. Fu!wood%», Mrs. Maguire'e, Mrs. Phillis's, Messrs. J. Maitlaud's, S. Allen's, J. RoUond's, A. Colrington'e, G. Cooper's, F. Fishlock's, F. Thomson's, C. Bar's, and J. Dean's, these losing the whole of their grass and fences. Tuen it sped on through the Rosebank Estate, Mr. MeGorinan's, Mr. C. Harding's, and Sirs. McDonald's properties, burning the whole nf the last-named's grass and de stroying 100 eheep. Messrs. G. Naismith, J. Xuismith, j. Buckley, H. Crouch, J\ Hooper, and C. Paecli also lost nearly all Llieir grass and fences, bat it is too early jet to give a correct account of the losses sustained. Nearly all of the unfortunates were milk sup* pliers to the factory, and, as some thousands of acres have been burnt, the cattle will fare badly. We do not know what the morrow may bring forth, as there are many logs and trees horning close to the edge of the grass. Scores^-of-men are watching all night and cart ing water to put out the logs and trees that seem most dangerous.
