BUSHFIRE NEAR MIDLAND JUNCTION. EIGHTY ACRES OF CORN DESTROYED. Yesterday afternoon a fire broke out on Mr. James Morrison's Bushmead Es- tate, on the Helena River, near Midland Junction, and before it could be stopped it destroyed about eighty acres of stand- ing corn and between thirty and forty acres of stubble and grass. The fire is supposed to have been started by some picknickers who were enjoying them- selves along the Helena River. For a time the flames threatened to destroy the Bushmead homestead. The latter was, in fact, saved only by the efforts of a number of workmen who were sent to Mr. Morrison's assistance by Mr. Bet- hune, of the Railway Workshops at Mid- land Junction.
