THE BUSH FIRES. BIG OUTBREAK AT SEYMOUR. THOUSANDS OF ACRES SWEPT SLEEPLESS WORKERS. SEYMOUR, Thursday.—The fire which broke out on Tuesday at Whitehead's Creek has proved most disastrous, and, so far it has defied the efforts of more than 100 men to put it out. The extreme heat of the last two days, accompanied by high winds—principally from the south-east—has been much against the fire- fighters, and they are almost powerless. The fire broke out in Chadwick's garden, not three hundred yards from where the big fire of a week ago swept. There was very long grass in Chad- wick's, and the fire spread rapidly into Mr. Hepburn's. This owner suffered heavily by the last fire, and what grass he had left has now been cleaned out. This week he has lost 400 acres. Farelly's leased block (195 acres) was cleared, as was Graham's (520 acres), Mrs. Mahon's (600 acres), the Parry Paddock (320 acres), and W. New- ton's (900 acres).

Crossing the water reserve it reached Mr. Joseph Unthank's paddock, both properties being completely swept. Further progress was stopped by Mr Joseph Unthank's cultivations. For a time the homesteads of Messrs J Al Cald- well and Joseph Unthank were in considerable danger, the former only being saved by a slight chance of the wind which enabled the large body of beaters lo check its progress.
