Fighting Bush Fires. *? Witii the approach of summer, when, in all probability, bush fires will become very prevalent and of more than ordinary violence, owing to the excess of grass, we have pleasure in drawing our readers' notice to the construction of what we are informed by a correspondent serves the purpose admirably of afire-beater. The beater we refer to is made by cuttings piece of harness leather from ISin. to 2ft. long, about Gin. wide at the outer. end, tapering in to, say, a couple of inches ; this is attached to a piece of wood or handle'5ft. or Cft. long, with a sawcut in the end in which the leather is placcd. and the whole riveted through or securely bound round. At homesteads where appliances are kept ready for the emei gency of a bush- fire we would recommend our friends to Gnpply -themselves with a number of these fire-beaters, the ordinary sack or green bush usually in use as ?fire- beaters being too heavy, and a person requiring to use them, as a rule, has to do so in a stooping position, which persons of experience will admit is .per haps the most tiring and'exhaustive work that can possibly be undertaken, and renders the beater more exposed to the smoke. Tho article we suggest may bo made of any length and very light. Nothing makes a better handle than an old handle of a hayrake, say about an inch in diameter. It also has the great advantage of being easily carried when upon horseback galloping to a distant tire. â€” Mail.
