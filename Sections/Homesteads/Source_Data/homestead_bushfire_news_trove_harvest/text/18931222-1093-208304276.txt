THE COUNTRY. , AN EXTENSIVE BTJSH-FIRE. DAMAGE iTO THE BOOYOOLIE [BUN. SUPPOSED TO BE CAUSED BY AN ENGINE. â€¢ Caltowie, December 21. A large tire broke out: to-day on a corner of the Booyoolie run, whioh abuts on to the rail way line about midway between Caltowie and Gladstone. It waB first observed immediately after the passenger train to Adelaide bad passed, and aB none of the offioials or passen gers, when questioned at Caltowie, noticed anything while passing the spot it seemB very probable a spark from the en gine was the cause. A strong wind blew from the west, and several farms and homesteads were endangered. A large number from the surrounding district turned out, and by strenuous efforts saved Mr. J. L. Batten's homestead and crop and Mr. David Thompson's. But not before about 50 baes of wheat belonging to the latter had been burnt. A large quantity of fenoing was destroyed, and about S.000 acres of grass on the Booyoolie run. About 300 people were on the spot in a very short time. Gladstone, December 21. An extensive fire raged on the Booyoolie run during the day." It was caused by a spark from the morning passenger train, and the day being exceedingly hot with a Btrong breeze blowing, the fire defied the efforts of. the crowd of men who collected to put it out. The wind took the fire at a terrific rate through the luxuriant feed, and it burnt several miles of excellent feed and some fenoing. Entering Mr. Thomp- j son's wheat paddooks it burnt SO bags of wheat whioh had been oleaned and bagged. As, j however, a strip had been burnt to meet the flameB the standing crop was not injured. The fire finally burnt out on reaching the creek, the farmers around having escaped j almost miraoulously.
