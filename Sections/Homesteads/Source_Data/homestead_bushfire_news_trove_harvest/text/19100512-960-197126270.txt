EAST GIPPSLAND PIONEERS. (By Ltrebird.) "|The country is virtually roadless,, its few isolated settlers live a Robinson Crusoe-like existence away from their fellow-men, &c.;, &c;," — The Age article recently re-printed L A homestead on the hillside, and near by, a spreading tree, Tbe McCullocb Range behind it, and southward lies the sea ; ,An air of rustic pleasure and a dew of many tears,— , ' . Tis the home of one of hundreds of East Qippslnud pioneers. ... " : ' . 11. - 'Way. yonder is the Tambo,— never' stream more gaily purled— „ It mocks tbe throbbing ' murmur of another outer world ; But northward -to tbe Border-like one Crusoe — lone and grand—'. There are lords of all creation, and monarchs of the land. 111 They muster " si Ores " from the ridges amongst the native hops, ! And " wheel " the wary straggleres that roam tbe mountain tops; .. . They swim tbe swollen rivers when in flood time running high, . And dream of roads and railways in the distant bye-and-bye., IV. They ring the giant messmates, where tangled fuchsias grow, And curse the thorns of " lawyers " with the swears that bushmen know; They blaze the tracks — expeotant — and for others clear the ways, While watobing on the skyline for the dawn of better days. v. ' ; Marching forth with gleaming aze through' shaded forest ways, — With costless sleeves and sun-brown arms the Nation's tracks thoy blaze. Let others yearn for pastime-t-'tis the eve of martial' strife. Foundation tbey are building to defend .. the Nation's life. , .. vi. While others sing of heroes of the battlefield ..and sea— . ' And all honor to' the brave ones where- ever they may be — Give me tbe one-man courage - that; without inspiring oheers, Can fight despair and bushfires like East Gippsland -Pioneers. ' .
