Longroach Land Court. THE Land Court lasted until Monday, the last cases heard being some improvements and several changes of tenure. On Monday after noon Mr. Woodbine announced bis decisions in the Longreach cases, also those adjourned from Barcaldine. Before giving bis decisions Mr. Woodbine saic^be had been asked, botb by Mr. R. J. McCullough and Mr. P. J. Leahy, to give a ruling as to bo# the rentals were determined, and whether the value of improvements was taken into consideration. He thought that this should not have been asked. He quoted section 30, subsection 5b, of the Land Act of 1884; also section 64, subsection 5b, of the 1897 Act. This latter said the value of the improve ments should not be taken into consideration. The Court bad to determine what was a fair rent for the first period under the 1902 Act, and all the evidence which was placed before it bad to be taken into consideration. It had to de termine the fair value of the country to the people in the district in the first period of the lease. In the Charleville district the rents for the first period had been determined at from 158\. to 60s. per square mile. That these were fair rentals was shown in that none had been appealed against by either tbe Crown or the lessees. That district was also infested with rabbits. Of course it was more favorably situated than this district owing to its prox imity to the Southern wool markets. Taking all these things into consideration what was a fair rent to fix for the pick of Queensland in tha first period of the lease commencing on July 1st, 1904, or July 1st, 19051 All tbe evi dence submitted to him bad been taken into consideration. The grazing capacity was con sidered, but there were other things equally as important as that. He did not usually praise those who were paid to do their work, but he would like prefer to tbe excellent manner in which Mr. Robson Scott had drawn up his re ports, evidencing every care and that he had put in good work. This, and the fact that Mr. Scott had resided in tbe district for 21 years, had caused him to take great notice of the re ports, which were seldom challenged. The de cisions were then announced by tbe Registrar (Mr. J. Brown), who was a most courteous and attentive official. Greenhills.-Mr. Leahy appeared for the lessees, the executors of the late J. & W. Crom bie. The Crown valuation was 53s. 4d. per sq. mile, tbe lessees' 34s. The following evidence was taken Donald Charles C. Crombie deposed that he had managed Greeabills tor eight and a-haif years; he had known the run for 14 years; in an average season he considered the carrying capacity was a sheep to four acres; in the last seven years the place had only carried a sheep to nine acres. This year 30,000 acres of grass bad been burnt owing to the bush-fires, and 15 miles of fencing damaged. From October 1899 to tbe end of 1902 they lost 60,000 sheep, 50 cattle, and 35 horses, while the drought ex penditure was £4204. By Mr. Wilson : I have been away from the station for three months and I have beard that the lambing from the old ewes is only 2 per cent. This year has been very dry, only din. of rain having fallen. This year 4000 sheep had been sold, the first since the drought. There was only three months' supply of water in the tanks now.

By Mr. Wilson : Early last year I had to send 30,000 sheep to relief country; there are now 100,000 sheep, including lambs, on the run; the rainfall last year was 39in.; my experience of the West has been 17 droughts and nine good seasons; in my experience the 1884 drought was as bad as the last drought.
