Rust ill Victorian Wheat. , Tho rust has made its appearance in some wheat-growing districts (sayB the "Australasian ), and considerable areas have i been cut for hay, the furmers fearing that if .thoy hold on they would not harvest sufficient grain to pay for the cultivation of tho land. The result of this action will bo to put a large quantity of wheaten hay on tlio market. The reports aro still- fav ourable as to tho yiclu of wheat being about an average crop. The weather con ditions aro good, aud in a very short time now the wholo of tho wheat crop will bo harvested. In many places tlie land owners are beginning to anticipate serious bush-fires. The grass is abundant, and drying up rapidly. Every preparation should be made to copo with bush-fires, and by cutting up the country with, brgad fire-breaks, to render the. fire when it does occur, more manageable. Homesteads,' stacks, and fences should be protected as far as possible.
