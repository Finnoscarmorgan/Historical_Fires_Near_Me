Considerable difficulty was experienced in saving the stock, and large numbers of them have been burnt to death. Some ex- citing fights occurred to save homesteads. The damage is believed to be enormous. It is reported that two men hava died from the heat. Bush fires swept the country to the west and south of Nowra on Sunday and a number of settlers were burnt out. The town had a narrow escape. Fires in the direction of Parma, Bengilala, and Falls Creek had even more disastrous results. At Falls Creek several residences and a Church were burnt. At Tomerong dis- astrous fires were also blazing, and three settlers are reported to have lost their homes and all their belongings. A cool change set in on Monday morning. During Saturday and Sunday some very high temperatures were registered in the various parts of the State, in some in- stances the highest for the past 30 years. They ranged from 105 to 125 degrees.
