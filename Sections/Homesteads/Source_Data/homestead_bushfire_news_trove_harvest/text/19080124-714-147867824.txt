BUSH FfRE AT LAMEROO. An extensive bushlirc has been burning' for several days in the Lameroo district. It started from Moorlands and made its way towards Lanicroo. On Monday a strong north wind sprang up and drove the lire arross the railway-lino, but at midday the wind chopped around suddep ; ly 10 ihe south-west and carried the flames on towards Kamcroo. Many willing workers went io combat the fire, and they were only just in time to save Mr. Bowman from getting burnt out. Many homesteads were cleared right out by the flames. Mr. Daveiaett. jun., was very unfortunate, losing everything. He only just escaped with his wife and family. Our correspondent writes that a cool change, with rain, has set in.
