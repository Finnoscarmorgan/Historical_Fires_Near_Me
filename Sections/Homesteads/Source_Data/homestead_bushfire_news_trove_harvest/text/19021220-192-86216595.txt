Tie Home of imi Ago. BY WILLIAM FREAME. [For the Gazette.] Down on the old selection In the mountains' shadows cast, Just near the old Macdonald ; In the young and happy past. Nestling 'neath the 'blue gums By the river's fitful flow, Near the red and dusty roadway Was the home of long ago ' Burning off ' till dark at night ; While the greyness gently drew Its soft and misty mantle, Laden with the evening dew. Working hard, with axe and maul, Splitting, till the sun was low ; Fencing in the paddocks Of the home of long ago. Down on the old selection, In the cool and dreamy nights, Watching the dull reflection Of the bush-fires ruddy lights. Down o'er the old farm homestead ; By the waters, deep, and low Came the songs of evening, softly, In the nights of long ago. Down on the old selection, Where the grey, gaunt, timber's rung, The cattle wander slowly Out towards the billabong. Years, altering with their changes, For the scrub has overgrown The home beneath the ranges, Deserted, decayed, alone.
