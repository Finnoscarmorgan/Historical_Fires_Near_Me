Bush Fires. A destructive bu6h lire which swupt over several nula; of country and entailed the loss of a number oi hou es and large areas of grass und bush was ex perienced within a few miles of S?ydiievou the Gth instant. The flames had their or i^n in the Lowe i Bantstown district, and fanned by a 'strong hot whxi they spread rapidly. Quickly assuming largo pro - portions, the fire swept through vhouwnds oi acres of grass .and timbered country, consuming in its pr.j gi-ess every vestage of %ht vegetation, uuny miles of fencing, and several oi1 the hQinesleniM of selectors. The district was covered in a dei^r pall of:;n,oke. Most of the country extending frcjii Stouev l-«p.k- road, at Hurstville, to the St. Geoi-c liotd,' Canter- bury, was swept. A number of are brigades cult: a soon on the spot to render what assist:! nee tJit-y couM. but were hamperedby the scarcity of wk's-v, 'a. ]jj.-pe haystack, owned by Mr. Scahill was co.-ii])!eteJy gutted. Iu many instances thu iruits oi lout; uv\l arduous labour by the settlers were il-vtroyed :v:i.liiu a few minutes. Such was the case with a large stack of firewood, containing some hundreds of tons, which had been cut and carted together by the members of a family named Fitzgerald, and which fell a prey to the conflagration. Many other pathetic incidents ? occurred. It is likely that the nasnage will reach several thousands of pounds. The fire has left numbers of selectors homeless and, it is said, practi cally penniless. The bush fire at St. Marys is said to have been caused by some boys. The railway iettlers assisted nobly in the controlling of the firo. The principal losers are : — The Hon. P. C. King, fencing ; River stone Meat Company, grass ; Mr . J. K. Lethbridge, grass and fencing , Mr. F. West, grass and fencing ; Messrs. Davidson, Giles, Pye. and Greenhalgh, most of their grass.
