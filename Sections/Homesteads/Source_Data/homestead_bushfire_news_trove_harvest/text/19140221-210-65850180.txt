Bush and Grass Fires. One of the most serious fires that have occurred in the Peninsula for the past 20 years broke out about 1.30 p.m. on Wed- nesday. It destroyed a great deal of the fencing and grass on the properties of Dr Ryan and Mr Jas. Grice, "Moondah," About 300 acres of grass land was con- sumed, and nearly two miles of fencing. Had it not been for the energetic endea- vours of the residents of Frankston and Mornington, both the homesteads would have been demolished. Constable Step- hens, of Mornington, was very energetic burning breaks, and Constable McCallum, of Frankston, with several residents, ren- dered valuable assistance, under the direc- tion of Mr Geoff Grice. On Thursday word was received in Frankston that assistance was again needed at the scene of the fire, and a con- tingent of workers were conveyed out in Mr Benson's cabs. The fire had extended to "Nyora," the property of Mr Slaney, where fences and grass were destroyed. Mr Stevens' orchard was destroyed, but after a great struggle the house was saved. Mr Hanton had his 10-acre orchard de- molished, and an unoccupied three roomed cottage was burned to the ground. Our Langwarrin correspondent writes: â€”Bush fires have been raging in all parts of the district this week, and nearly every residents has had to help in saving pro- perty from destruction. On Thursday the ranges were all ablaze, and the settlers along the Cranbourne road had to work hard to keep the mass of seething flames from their homes. Fortunately, the wind was not strong, or their efforts would have been futile. A good lot of fencing has been destroyed. Mr D. P. Cain had his haystack burned as well as some out- buildings. The fires are still raging in the timber country towards Pearcedale.
