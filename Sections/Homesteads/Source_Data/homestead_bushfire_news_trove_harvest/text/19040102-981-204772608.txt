Bushfire at North Midland EIGHTY ACRES OF CORN DESTROYED. On Monday afternoon * fire broke out on Mr James Morrison's Bushmead Estate, on the Helena River, near Midland Junction, and before it could be stopped it had destroyed about eighty acres of standing corn and between thirty and forty acres of stubble and grass. The fire is supposed to have been started by some picknickers who were enjoying themselves along the Helena River. For a time the flames threatened to destroy the Bushmead homestead. The latter was, in fact, saved only by the efforts of number of men who were sent to Mr Morrison's assistance by Mr Bethune, of the railway workshops. Naturally, - the sufferers by the fire are annoyed at the cureless manner in which picknickers light fires and leave them. It is to be hoped that all picnickers will be more careful of their fires in future.
