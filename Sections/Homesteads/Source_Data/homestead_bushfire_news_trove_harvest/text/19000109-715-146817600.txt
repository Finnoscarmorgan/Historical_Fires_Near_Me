MOUNT GAHBIKIt. THE DISASTROUS FIRE. (From Our Oirn Oorrtnpnndent.) January 7. The fire that I referred to in my letter of Wednesday as having traversed the Coola German Greek, Barnoolut, Mount Sohnnck, and Moorak estates, and entered the farm at O.B. Flat and Square Mile, did a great deal more damage than was that evening known. It was a most unpleasant day here. A hot wind blew hard all the forenoon, and in the afternoon, about 2 o'clock, suddenly shifted to the westward, and later on to the south-west ward. When the change set in the tempera ture became agreeably cool, but the wind blew a gale, and carried clouds of dust with it, and dense volumes of smoke from the bushfires to the south-west darkened the sky and per meated the atmosphere, The people in town, startled at the twilight darkness that set in, were very anxious about the fires, and when the firebell was rung about half-past 8 for volunteers to go out to Benara and help to pre vent the fire entering Moorak, their anxiety developed into genuine and restless alarm. A couple of dozen volunteers, taking what vehicles were available, went out to Benara homestead, and did good work by pre venting in entering Moorak for a dis tance of nearly a mile, but it entered Moorak in a sheet two miles wide fur ther to the eastward, swept a third of the estate, and ran through the farms at O.B. Flat and Square Mile; doing damage to 12 or 13 agriculturists. From near Benara to the southernside of the fire, a mile north of the Bellum, shows that it most have been nearly nine miles wide, a truly gigantic flame. It was stopped by potato- fields and roads in the farms, but crossed the Mount Schanck run into Mr. A. C. Spehr's Caveton property, and Mr.F. Davison's, and-stopped there, about 12 miles from the River Glenelg, having during the day traversed from 18 to 25 miles. Mr. T. C. Ellis, owner of Coola and Bardoolut, had 25,000 acres of grass burnt and 50 miles of fencing damaged, besides windmills and other property. Estimated damage, £1,500. Mr. Browne had 7,000 acres, nearly the whole estate, burned at German Creek, and over 3,000 acres of Moorak, besides many miles of fencing and other property, as well about 300 Lincoln sheep, Estimated damage on both places about £1,500, Half or more of the Mount Schanck Estate was swept, over 50,000 acres, besides an uncalculable length of' fencing. Few stock were, however, destroyed. Damages estimated, £2,000. Mr. R, M. Gardiner had 5,000 or 6,000 acreas of his Benara estate swept, the fencing consumed, eight or nine haystacks, several windmills, about 800 sheep, 40 head of cattle and several horses killed and injured. Damage probably £1,000 or £1,200. The chief losers among the farmers and smaller graziers were:—Mr. A. G. Spehr, £1,000; Messrs. A. &.J. Mitchell, £500; Mr. J. J. Schinkel £300; Mrs. Laube, £300; Mr. W. Berksfield, £300; Mr, F. Davison, £253; Mrs. Couttas £160; Mr. C- Patzel, £200; Messrs. Buchanan Bros., about £80; other farmers at O.B. Flat and Square Mile, say £200. Total damage, exclusive of grass, £9,500. That does not include smaller losses sustained, by several farmers in the Hundred of Benara and three or four near Allandale, whioh wonld raise the amount to quite £10,000. Then the grass. The area of grass destroyed is about 93,000 acres, as follows:—Coola and Barnoolut, 25,000 acres; German Greek, 7,000 acres; Mt. Schanck, 50,000 acres; Whinham estate, 5,000 acres; Moorak, 3,000 acres; and the various farms at O.B. Flat and Square Mile, 3,000.. Taking' the average value of the grass at 1s 6d per acre per annm (a very high estimate, though), and that is lost to the owners for four months, will mean £2,320 more, making the total damage over £12,000. The want of- grass will be a serious incon venience to many stock owners for a few months, but friends are coming forward wil lingly and offering assistance in that way. Mr. G. Riddooh, of Koorine, has offered free grass for 200 head of cattle, and smaller people are offering what they can. It ie believed one of the fires started near the railway line on Near Year's Day forenoon, not far from Burrnngull, and it is thought it was caused by a spark from the train locomotive. The second is said to have started on the same day in Buck's paddook, German Greek.
