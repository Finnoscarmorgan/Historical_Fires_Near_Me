" DELEGATE RIVER. By M T Cartridge January 9. the fierces and most disastrous bushfire over known here passed through this and the surrounding districts on 30th and 3 1st. December and 1st Jnnanry. It did a great deal of damage, burning miles and miles of fencing nnd grass. In fact it burnt almost everything in its path. In other districts thousands of sheep and numbers of horses, cattle, pigs and poultry fell victims to the fire. A number of settlers in the Tingaringi and Wallendibby districts were burnt out completely ; others were fortunate enough to save their houses. In several instances there was a a run for life. The fire, with such a strong wind behind it, conld not be stopped by any means whatever ; the sparks kept lighting the grnss fully half a mile in advance of the main body of fire. Almost everybody was beginning to despair of saving any grass, but fortunately Monday, 2nd Janunry, broke misty, and in the after noon it rained lightly. On Tuesday and Wednesday showers fell, the rainfall for the three days registering 58 points. It is a most sorrowful thing to pass where the fire has been and see the ruined homesteads. In some places the houses stand without a vestige around them of anything in the shape of food for stock, and to see tho poor animal wandering aimlessly about in search of food is sad indeed. Owners arc getting their stock to grass as quickly as possible, but mustering is difficult, especially in the case of sheep, as they have wandered so far and all the flocks are mixed. On Delegate River no live stock were lost, but the losses here in grass and fences were exceedingly heavy.
