THE HEAT WAVE. A COOL CHANGE. MORE HOT WEATHER. EFFECTS. Great relief was experienced by Adelaide residents on Tuesday evening when pleasant breezes from the south lowered the tem- perature. At midday on Tuesday the ther- mometer reading was 108.4 deg., and some idea of the fall will be obtained when it is stated that the night temperature came down to 67 deg., a difference of over 41 degrees. The readings of the previous nights since the new year were:-January 1, 79.5 deg.; January 2, 83.5 deg.; January 3, S2.5 deg.; January 4, 88.5 deg:; January. 5, 88 deg.; January 6, 79 deg. It will ba seen, therefore, that Tuesday rnight was bjl far the coolest for over a week. Wednesday morning broke appreciably cooler, but for a couple of hours fears wera entertained that the weather would be S repetition of that of previous days. How* ever, about 9 o'clock the sky became oves» cast, and the influence of a southerly breeza made conditions mnch more endurable Ab 10.45 a.m. a severe duststorm swept over the city and lasted for about half an hour. In the afternoon & few drops of rain fell» and again in' the evening there waa a sprinkle, but hardly enough to register. Reports from the Observatory showed ' that at 12 o'clock the temperature was 903 deg., but under the influence of a fresh southerly breeze then blowing the ther- mometer reading fell to 78 deg. in the short space of a quarter of an hour. Thereafter the conditions became sultry again, but there was no doubt about the break in the heat wave, and it is reassuring to know that cooler weather may be expected for a few days. t When seen at 12.30 p.m. on Wpttaesday-, Mr. G. F. Dodwell, B.A., the State divisional officer, said:-"The cool change influences, t which, during the past two days, have been' at work, have now established themselves ' over the greater portion of South Aus trilia- Throughout our western, central, . and southern districts the weather is nowiU much cooler, with pleasant southerly' breezes blowing in from the ocean. In the West Coast districts it is gloomy this mor-i?'-, ing, and p. little rain has fallen. The in-* land portions of the State-will soon benetifc , by the cool change. A remarkable develop* .. ment is shown in this morning's weather map.. A V-shaped depression now exists"" between South Australia and the eastern* > [ States. To *he westward a moderate high-T" pressure system is developing greatly iii*"' energy, and as it advances eastward ,we »; may expect a continuance of cool weather, for some days, with southerly breezes." THE WATER SUPPLY. ~"~-* -, r'tli Naturally during such a warm spell as the metropolitan area has passed through the consumption of water was enormous, but the public have little idea of the drain upon the reservoirs that such hot weather involves. Only the officials are able to give the figures. The Hydraulic Engineer (Mr. C. A. Bayer) stated on Wednesday that the mains were taxed to the utmost, and upwards of 15,000,000 gallons of water were consumed daily from the reservoirs at Happy Valley, Hope Valley, and Thornd n Park. During the month of January last year the highest figure foj\an>' single day was 14,800,000 gallons. The ordimry or normal consumption is fronr JO to 12 mä lion gallons per day. Mr. BavtvT cstirAatea that the loss from evaporation iu the three reservoirs lowers them 70 in s. ©»cb year. "But in spite of the 'heavy &ÇU. sumptinn. plus the evaporation," he said.v, confidently, "we have anv mrrnti'V of *. water, and there need never be the flijht st' > fear of a famine in that respect. Cer- tainly in hot weather the pr~ssure is nob , so great çis oon-iumers would possibly de- sire, and'there is no'doubt the time is ap- proaching when we «¡hall have to 'ay do**n another principal main to th" citv.'

During the recent heat spell Dr. W. M. Holtze and his staff of assistants at the Bo- tanic Gardens worked at high pressure to minimise the damage to the flower beds and trees, but a walk through the Gardens on Wednesday afternoon sufficed to show that in many cases their skilled care was unavailing. Whole beds of phlox and other delicate annuals will have to be re- placed as the tender shoots and leaves have been scorched black, and the plants cannot possibly revive. On all sides the gardens present an untidy appearance owing to many trees, particularly the Moreton Bay figs. having shed their leaves freely in con- sequence of the prolouged heat wave. Al- ready, however, the gardeners are attacking the big task of bringing the gardens to their previous high standard of excellence, but they are handicapped by the fact that three of the staff are absent, having been overcome by the heat. It was noticable that the plants growing in close proximity to the asphalt footpath sustained the most damage. This is explained by the fact that during the hot spell the heat reflected by the paths was tremendous. Beds of gera- niums had leaves and blooms much injured by the heat, but Dr. Holtze states that those plants will quickly return to their pristine condition. Even in the shade- houses damage was notieed, leaves of plants closest to the roof being burnt brown. The rose trees have come well through this se- vere trial, and Dr. Holtze was surprised that the perennial phlox, which many peo- ple find it so difficult to propagate, showed not the slightest signs of iniury. There is a fine collection of dahlias in the nursery, and many of these looked as if they had been frost-bitten—again the effect of the intense heat. The cannas have also suf- fered. Dr. Holtze uses 30,000,000 gallons of water in the gardens in the course of a year, at a cost of £750. During the hot spell he estimates that he doubled the sup- ply of water, and he would have used still more if he had been able to work the sprink- lers on the holidays, when the lawns were crowded with visitors. It was noticed that while many of the water-lilies have suf- fered to the extent of having their leaves discolored, the Sacred Lotus of Japan, whose roots are prized in the East as an article of diet, came through absolutely un- scathed. Dr. Holtze states that at the Mylor Experimental Orchard a great many of the apples have been burnt on the trees, and the young shoots have been scorched off. DEATHS AT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. The weather for the past few days has been especially severe on elderly people and young children, and a great deal of general sickness is reported throughout the city and suburbs. At such institutions as the Destitute Asylum and the Home for Incur- ables, where many of the inmates are in a weak condition, the days and nights have been extremely trying. Three of the old people died at the Destitute Asylum on Tuesday. One, a woman, was aged 70 years, and the men were aged ft and 63 years. £ Öeatfr also tx*cnrred at tí» Home for fncnr "ables on Tuesday night, and four or five o X Hie inntates are ill, but as the cool chang!
