Bush Fires at Stewart's River. CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE AND MANY NARROW ESCAPES. On Saturday, 4th inst., the residents of Stewart's River spent an anxious time combating the bush fires, which raged for some hours with great fury — the flames being fanned by the strong south-west wind which sprang up that morning. The fire swept through Mr. S. Redman's property, then on to Mr. John Royan's brush, where a con- siderable quantity of fencing and herbage was destroyed, whilst the house was only saved by strenuous exertions— Mrs. Royan and family being compelled, for safety sake, to leave the premises. Mr. and Mrs. T. Royan for some time also worked hard to save their homestead, and were in the end successful. The house was surrounded by the fires, and sparks were flyiug over it. Mr. Royan lost about fifty panels of fencing. Mr. Lill and Mr. Jas. Royan were also sufferers. Lower down the river, on the opposite side, the brush on Mr. P. McGovern's property caught fire, and the flames swept on to Mr. W. Cross's residence, and although fourteen or fifteen stout hearts were ready to combat the devouring element, the pre- mises would surely hare been destroyed had not the wind providentially changed round to the east. Although no houses were burned down, the loss in fencing and grass has been very heavy.
