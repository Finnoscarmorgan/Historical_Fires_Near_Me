EARLY BUSHFIRES A fire, which is attributed to incendi arism, broke out at the foot of the Bass Ranges, near Kilounda, and for some time the homesteads of Messrs P. Peters, C. Steinholdt, J. B. O’Mara, and W. Dens ley were in danger, but a small army oi fire fighters came to the rescue, and even tually checked thp progress of the flames. The principal losers were: —The Bass Saw Moiling Cos., tram road, culverts, etc., 6B100; Mr C. Steinholdt, 150 acres of grass and fencing; Cr J. B. O’Mara, 30 acres grass and fencing; -Mr W. Emery, 70 acres scrub pa-auoek; Mr Eraser, 100 acres; Mr P. Peters, about 15 acres. Bush fires have commenced early at Rushworfch this year. During the past week-fires have started at Deep Creek, Mopoke, and the bead of the Six-mila Creek, localities all within a short dis tance of Beeohworth, from which the flames are visible at night. The fires are attributable to the l laige amount of fallen timber and tops of trees left by prop cut ters and wood choppers. These have ac cumulated for some years, and are easily ignited by the careless use of matches by the wood choppers themselves. At De;ep Creek the residents had to turn out and beat the fire back from their residences, which were in danger. After the fire was completely subdued, it broke out again the following night, loading to tjhe inference that some person was lighting 1 it purposely. .
