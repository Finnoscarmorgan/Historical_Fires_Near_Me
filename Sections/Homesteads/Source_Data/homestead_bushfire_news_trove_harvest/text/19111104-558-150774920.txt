ARE YOU READY FOR BUSH FERES? "Witli the unfortunate possibility or a dry summer facing them. landholders should waste no time in taking precau tions against bush fire. It is some time since there has been a really bad "bush i hut we cannotafford to forget s the grim lessons of tho past. The pro- I visions of fire insurance, which appear 1 to be a wise step more commonly taken j of late, entail the ordstenco of fire breaks. But, quite apart from that, j ] there should certainly not he a cultiva- t turn paddock without a good wide i ploughed broak. Where.possible, boun daries should be similarly protected. While it is true that a strong firo, fed with high winds, will jump almost any sort of break, m the main the latter are of groat assustance in checking the" spread of fire. Cutting a good strip of grass country with a mower in the hope of securing a strip, given a fall of rain1 later, of green grass, has also been' found of service. Where tliore is a good growth of grass and tko country is clear onough to work the mower and rake, the process also provides a useful supply of bush hay, or material for a silo or ensilage pit. Eating the jiad docks bare adjacent to the homesteads, by keeping them heavily stocked is a simple method of protecting the build ings in the case of a really bad out break. It does not tend to improve tho' appearance of tho place at midsummer certainly, but appearances count for little if the countryside is being swept by flames. Every step should bo taken to continue the bush-fire brigade system this season. For tho sake of the "little expense and arrangement involved it is suicidal in any district where there is a' possibility of" bush-fires doing damage not to establish some sort of organisah tion with the object of concentrating the fight against the. fire in an-intelli gent manner. ,;
