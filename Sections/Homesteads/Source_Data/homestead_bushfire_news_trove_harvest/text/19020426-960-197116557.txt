Benjamin Spencer ploughed in the fields when be was a lad of ton. He begftn at a salary of a dollar a week, and worked on tho sntno fields for twenty years, daring w Itich time, owing . to bis saving habits" and - sobriety, he saved a " thousand dollars. Eventually he pur chased the farm from his employer and married. Five years after his mar riage he decided to go with his wife for a trip to Europe. Foolishly he drew ull his money out of the bank in notes, stating in "country parlance," he would not trust any bank while he wns away. Two days before his de parture a bushfiro oennrred on his farm. In a very short lime tho flames spread to the homestead, ntni every cent of Spenoer's money was destroyed, and the unfortunate tanner became penniless. What cannot occur in a day.?
