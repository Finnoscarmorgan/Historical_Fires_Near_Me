FROM PROSPERITY to POVERTY. A SAD RESULT of a BUSH FIRE. Perhaps thc saddest circumstance re- sulting from a bush fire is ono which oc- curred iu Winnipeg, Canada, in Juue last year. Benjamin Spencer ploughed in the fields when he was a lad of ten. He began at a salary of a dollar a week, and worked on the same fields for twenty years, during which time, owing to his saving habits" and sobriety, he saved a thousand dollars. Eventually ho pur- chased the farm from bis employer and married. Five years after his marriage he decided to go with his wife for a trip to Europe. I oolishly he drew all his money out of the bank in notes, stating in a "country parlance" he would not trust any bank while he was away. Two days before his departure a bushfire oc- curred on his farm. In a very short time the flames spread to the homestead and every cent, of Spencer's money was destroyed, and the unfortunate larmer became penniless.
