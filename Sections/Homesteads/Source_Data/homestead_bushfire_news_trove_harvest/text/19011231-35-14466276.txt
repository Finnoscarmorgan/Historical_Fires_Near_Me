THE HEAT WAVE. HUGE BUSH FIRES. LARGE AREAS INVOLVED. DAMAGES ESTIMATED AT UPWARDS OF Â£50,000. SETTLER BURNED TO DEATH. DETAILS OF THE CONFLAGRATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL OUTBREAK. WHERE IT OCCURRED. The news of the great distress of settlers in the bushfire country was received everywhere yes- terday with deep sympathy. As showing the intensity and the vastness of the bush conflagration, it was stated by a master of a vessel that the smell of smoke was distinctly perceptible 100 miles off the land. The ravages of this almost unprecedented baptism of fire in the country are further described by our correspondents in the distressed localities. Locally the change to easterly and cooler weather was welcomed. It will be seen from our correspondents' reports that the bush fires were not to any extent subdued by the rainfall that took place in the southern dis- tricts. Fires along the coast are, however, during the dry season not unexpected in the month of December, and many settlers make more or less provision for an invasion of the kind. Hundreds of the oldest homestead-owners have been included in the list of sufferers by the phenomenal severity of the invasion. So far as Sydney's records of rain are involved, the records are that the average to the end of last month was 47in., while up to yesterday the fall had been but 40in. That percentage of shortness will probably be found to apply to a large part of the State.
