COLINROOBIB. BOSH riBIB. Tha fire-king was abroad here last week, when the first bushfire of the season broke out on Mr Warren's property and swept away part of his grass, passing to. Mr P. Ecnney's it burnt 200 acres of grass and about faalf'tt-iaile of fencing, all the grass on Mrs Dpherty's property then disappeared before the devouring element, while Mr Barrett saved nothing but his homestead and stacks, Mr Dicker's paddocks were also swept by the fire and part of Mr Chalker's selection. Though great damage was done, yet, con sidering the terrific heat and wind which prevailed., it is marvellous that matters were not much worse.. Taking last week al together it was the most disastrous Colin roobie has experienced. DBIVISa ACCTDCNT.

A BALL. A most successful ball came off at the Flodden Field Hall on the evening of the 15th. The evening was delightfully cool, between twenty and thirty couples putting in an appearance, and some remarkably nice costames were worn. Two young ladies in pink and white respectively came in for a fair share of admiration if one may judge from the way they were besieged with partners. Mr Bourke acted as M.C. with his customary ability, and Mr Hair supplied the music (violin), while the catering (in the hands of Meadamea Bourke and Wade) gave great satisfaction. WESLETAN SOCIAL. The social in aid of the Wesleynn Church takes place on Wednesday, the 27th, the boll having been engaged for the evening, a monster gathering is expected. This hall supplies a long felt want in the district, I speak from experience, as it has always been my luck to be crowded out it these festive gatherings.
