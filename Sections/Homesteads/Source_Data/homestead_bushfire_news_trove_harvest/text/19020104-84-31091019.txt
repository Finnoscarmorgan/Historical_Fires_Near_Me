One man had to abandon his horse and plunge in a creek. He :escaped, but the, horse ,was 'roasted.- 'Another lar down on the road while the flan8es .pased over hi'r.. Eight'men were in a carlnand. the horse plaiving up broke the shaft, throw' ing the men out. They just reached a'dam as the terrace of flame passed along. Dozens of maimed horses `and cattle have been shot to 'end- their sufferings. It is persistently rumoured that the outbreak is due to incendiarism'.
