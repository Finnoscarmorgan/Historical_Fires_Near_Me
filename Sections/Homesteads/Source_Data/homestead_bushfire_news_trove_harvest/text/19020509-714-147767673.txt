From Prosperity to Poverty. A SAD RESULT OF A BU3HFIRE. Perhaps the saddest circumstance resulting from a bushfire is one which occurred in Winnepeg, Canada, in June last year. Ben* jimin Spencer ploughed in the fields when he was a lad of ten. He began at a salary of a dollar a week, and worked on the same fields for twenty years, duriog which time, owing to his saving habits and sobriety, he saved u thousand dollars. Eventually lie purchased the farm from his employer and married. Fire years after his marriage he decided to go with his wife for a trip to Europe. Foolishly he drew all his mon>*y out of the bank in cotes, stating in country parlance lie would not trust any bank while he was sway. Two days before his deuarlure a bush* fire occurred on his farm. In a very short time the fiines spread to the homestead, and every cent, of Spencer's tn Â»ney wa* consumed, and lite unfortunate farmer became penniless. What cannot occur in a day ?
