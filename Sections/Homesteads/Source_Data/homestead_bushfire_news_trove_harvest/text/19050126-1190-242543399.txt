Prevention of Busl| Fires, We observe that tho Chamber of Agri culture iuih become impressed with tho need of systematic prevention of hush fires, and to that end has appointed a committee to devise and to recommend fresh legislation on the subject. legis lation Is undoubtedly useful and neces sary, but mcnuwhllc much good work may be done by Individual effort. While we have to wait for legislation the Chamber of Agriculture can do good work by suggesting methods suitable to the farmer for making bis homestead, his fencing, and his property generally fairly safe. It Is hardly possible for Vic toria to experience another Black Thurs day, because the progress of settlement has Isolated tho forests, whilst the roads and railways make so many fire-breaks against the flames. It Is cmlneutly do- slrnble that every former should Isolate Ms property by flrc- brenks of some kind, easily made during the winter by plough ing and clearing along the line of his fences. Many have done this to their lasting benefit and safety, whilst the planting of certain sorts of grasses, such as the paspalum dilatatura, or golden crown grass (admirably described In Mussina's Weather Almanac), In long strips In suitable places, will servo as a fire-break as well as being useful fodder for the farm. We commend the Chamber of Agriculture for Its action, and hope that IU example will be followed by other agricultural bodies throughout the country. Mean while, It is satisfactory to observe that Sir Samuel Glllott, the Chief Secretary, when Interviewed by a deputation from the Chamber, promised that tho police would do their part to prevent bushfires, and bring to justice those who i cause them. Careless use of fire Is a crime, and It may easily be a crime of the gravest character. There Is much force, too, In what Superintendent Maboney says about the ridiculous le niency with which some magistrates treat offendirs whom the police bring before thorn.
