THE FIRE FIEND. Sherbrooke District Devastated : (From our Correspondent.) SHERBRROKE, Tuesday. Afer our efforts last week we were fondly hoping that the danger from the un- paralleled bush-fires that had been disfigur- ing the country for several days was quite over, but alas our sanguine anticipations have not been realised. Yesterday afternoon a strong breeze sprang up, and soon the bush below Mr. Dinning s property was a mass of flame. This was about half-past 4, and towards dusk the fire reached the Union Church, which was entirely demolished, only the organ and seats being saved. Al- most simultaneously Mr. Dinning's house and orchard went with a rush, and further down Mr. Turnbull's residence then became envelop in inflames. Mr. John Knight's house near the church was only saved by supreme exertions on the part of a noble band of volunteers. The fire swept on, and by 7.30 had reached Mr. Franklin Knight's homestead, which was quickly razed to the ground, only a few articles of furniture having been saved. An unoccu- pied house close by belonging to Mr. Fred Knight was also destroyed. Mrs. Wilson's boarding establishment caught fire in several places, but the band of volunteers suceeeded in subduing the flames and sav- ing the main property, although several outbuildings were destroyed. The sawmill was in great danger all night, having to be constantly watched. The wind is terrible, and Mr. Haberley's house was wholly wrecked yesterday. The homeless families took refuge in the Public-sohool and Mr. Fritz's house. Of the buildings destroyed, so far as is yet known, Mr. F. Kuight's was the only one insured.
