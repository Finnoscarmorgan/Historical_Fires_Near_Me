A little after noon tho boll at ibo fire station was rung, and tho townspeople turned out in larfpj numbers, and succeeded, sfter much difficulty, in beating back the flames. 'Hie home stead of Mr. Thomas O’Connor was saved, after all the milk in the dairy had been poured on the fire, which burned right up to tho weather boards. Mr, O'Connor lost about 400 acres of grass and several miles of fencing. Mr. Walter H. Davidson, tho owner of Coliban Park Es tate, also lost a quantity of fencing and about 500 acres of grass, Mr. E. Rovyo and others suffered to a lesser extent, and tho fire travelled over several hundred acres of Crown lands.
