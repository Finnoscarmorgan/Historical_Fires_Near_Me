DISTRICT NEWS. Buln Buln East. From Our Correspondents. \Weather very dry and hot, chang ing the green pastures to the hue of brown and the forests from green to black, as bushfires have been spreading, though no damage has been done to anv homestead. On Thursday, what might have been a most serious accident oc curred to Mrs Briggs and her eldest daughter while they were driving to Warragul to catch the Warragul train to Melbourne. They were going quietly along down what is known as Malone's Hill, on the up per Bloomfield road, when they heard a noise. The horse heard it also and taking fright, upset the buggy, throwing them both to the ground, when it ran the buggy up the bank and turned itself over and over until the whole was a most over until the whole was a beauti ful wreck. Glad to say Mrs Briggs and her daughter got off with only a few scratches and a nervous shake up.
