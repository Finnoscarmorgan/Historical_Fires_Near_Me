BUSH FIRE AT LAKE ROWAN. MELBOURNE, Wednesday. ' The bushfire at Lake Rowan on Saturday was the most extensive and disastrous which has occurred since tbe earliest settlement. Tho country traversed by the fire presents a dismal appearance. In some cases comfortable homesteads, stacks of machinery, grain and stock, have gone, fence and telegraph poles have been swept away, and one can drive in any direction without meeting any obstacle but wires trailing along in the ashes. Men, women, and children displayed great heroism in endeavours to save their homes. Tho loss caused by the fire in this district cannot yet be estimated.
