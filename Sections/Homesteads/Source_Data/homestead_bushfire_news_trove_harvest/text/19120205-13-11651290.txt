DROMANA RESIDENCES LOST. DROMANA, Saturday.—Last evening, at about half-past 5 o'clock, a bush fire swept a portion of the country between Dromana and Rosebud. It swept away the residences of Mrs. Coburn, Springbank, and the sum- mer residence of Mr. Frank Cornwell (sic, Cornell), de- spite the efforts of a large number of work- ers. Miss Burrell's house was saved after great exertions. Mrs. Coburn's house and furniture were insured for £800. The build- ing was demolished in ten minutes. Mrs. Coburn's son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. C. Burrell, saved only a few personal effects. The township of Rosebud is safe, and the fire is now burning in the direction of Boneo. Portion of the same fire swept towards Heronswood, the seaside residence of Mr. Justice Higgins. The fate of the residence was for some hours uncertain, but the flames were finally beaten off. Fires are still burning at Arthur's Seat and to- wards Mount Martha.
