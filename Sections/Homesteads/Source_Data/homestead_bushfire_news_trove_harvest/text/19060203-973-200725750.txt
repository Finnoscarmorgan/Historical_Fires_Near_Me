VICTORIAN BUSH FIRES. The Mayor referred to the terrible effects of the recent bush fires in Vic- toria, by which miles of country had been devastated, and whole families rendered homeless. He said that he had been asked to open a subscription list for the relief of the sufferers. The editor of the Beverley Times. Mr Courtney, had kindly offered to place the columns of his valuable paper at the disposal of the fund committee free of charge, for acknowledging subscriptions. Councillor Powell said he had a knowledge of the district in which the fires had taken place, and could speak as to the widespread distress which had been caused. Most of the settlers in the districts were people whose homesteads did not exceed from 200 to 300 acres, and the effects of such an awful fire in the district could scarcely be realised. He would have much pleasure in rendering what assistance was in his power for the relief of the sufferers. All the councillors present expressed their sympathy with, and willingness to assist in any movement that might be taken in hand for the benefit of the sufferers, and on the motion of Cr. Chipper, seconded by Cr. Powell, the Mayor was asked to open a fund for the relief of the sufferers, to be called "The Victorian Bushfires Relief Fund."
