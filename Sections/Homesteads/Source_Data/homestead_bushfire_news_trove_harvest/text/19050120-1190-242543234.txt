BubI| Firo Provoqtloq. We observe that the Clmraber of Agri culture bas become Impressed with tbe need ot systematic prevention of busli fires, nnd to that cud luis appointed u I committee to devise and to recommend fresh legislation on the subject, legis lation Is muluubtfMlly useful and ncces- I snry. but meanwhile uiueh good work may be done by Individual effort. While we have to wait for legislation the CharnixT of Agriculture can do good work by suggesting methods suitable to the farmer for making his homestead, his fencing, and Ills property generally fairly safe?. It Is hardly possible for Vic- 1 torla to experience another Black Tluirs- \ day, because the "progress of aettlomcnt has Isolated the forests, uuilat the roads ami railways make so many fire-bccaks against the flames. It Is eminently do- slrnhlc that every farmer should isolate Ws property by fire-breaks of .some kind, easily made during the winter by plough ing nml clenring along tbe line of his fences. Many have done this to their Jnstlng benefit nud rafcly, whilst the planting of certain Forts of graces, such nn thu paspaluni dlhitatum, or golden crown grass (admirably dercrlbed in Mussina's Weather Almanac), In long strips In (suitable places, will serve as a fire-break ns well iis being useful fodder for tho farm. We commend tbc Chamber of Agriculture for Its action, and hope- that Its example will be followed by other agricultural Iwdles throughout the country. Mean while, it is satisfactory to observe that Sir Snmnel Gitlott, tbe Chief Secretary, when interviewed by a deputation from the Chamber Pvdny, promised that the police should do their part lo prevent bushfires, aud bring to justice those who cause tliom. Careless u?e of fire Is n crime, and It may easily be a crime of the gravest character. There is mucb force, too, In what Superintendent Mnhoncy says about tho ridiculous le niency with which some magistrates treat offenders whom the police bring before tlicui.
