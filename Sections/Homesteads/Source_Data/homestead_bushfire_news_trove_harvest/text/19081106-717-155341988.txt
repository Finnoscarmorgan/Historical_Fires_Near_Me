WATTVILLE. The annual meeting of the Wattville bush-fire brigade was held in the Wattville school-room on Saturday last.. The cap- tain (Mr. Doyle) presided, and there was a fair attendance. The secretary (Mr. A. Harker) reported that there was a balance in hand of £3. He also reported that the pumps and accesories at the various stations were in good order, being well attended to by the caretakers. The fol- lowing office-bearers were elected : — Cap- tain and president, Mr. Doyle (re elected); hon. secretary, Mr Harker (re-elected) ; treasurer, Mr. C. Ludemann ; lieutenants, Messrs. A. McPartIand, W. Murphy, jun., Fortune, Hickey, and Weideman. The brigade strongly advises all landholders to at once take steps (by making fire- breaks, etc.) to make their homesteads as secure as possible against fire. By doing this they will be able to assist the brigade in case of an outbreak, and not have to start and do the work when the fire is in sight. They also advise farmers to see that their firebeaters are in good order, and that there is a good supply on hand. The captain, in a neat speech, thanked those present for the confidence they placed in the officers by re-electing them. On the motion of Mr. L. Harker, a vote of thanks was passed to the officers for their services.
