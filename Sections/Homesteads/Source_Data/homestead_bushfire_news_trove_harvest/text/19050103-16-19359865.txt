THE WEATHER CONDITIONS. The year has opened with a weather account in which excessive heat is the dominating factor ; for from all parts of the continent the story of phe- nomenal temperatures for the first two days of the New Year is to hand. We are never surprised at the occurrence of great heat in January. , Last year our thermometers registered just over lOOdeg. in Brisbane, and the year be- fore the mercurj- xvas still higher on one occasion. We expect summer temperature in these latitudes, but may xvell congratulate ourselves that we escape the extremes that turn the Southern capitals into veritable fur- naces. One hundred and -seven de- grees of heat in Sydney must be well nigh intolerable, and in other parts of the mother State the thermometer readings have been extraordinarily h'igh. If the high temperature stood alone it would be trying enough to bear, but when there are added the heartbreaking experiences of extensix*e bushfires the situation is intensified ia its difficulty and loss. Miles and miles of country "have come under the pitiless sweep of the flames, and the settlers in those districts where the fires ha\\-e been severest hax-e lost very heavily. In the Goulburn, Moss Yate, ana Gundagai districts, the. loss of homesteads and buildings has been severe, and in the Culcairn district thousands of acres of wheat have been destrox ed The heartiest sympathy will be felt foi those who have suf fered from the ravages of fire To see the home that has been got together after perhaps years of patient toil swept out of existence in the course of a few minutes, to watch the trans formation of acres of golden grain into a blackened waste, is an expen ence sad enough and bad enough to break the stoutest hearts and yet it is just here where the true« grit of the lace comes in, and all over Aus tralla the story of life begun all over again bj men and women past middle age is by no means uncommon In our own Sate, a peculiar]} sad mci dent has occurred, the destruction of a homestead near Landsborough involv ing also loss of life One of the most disastrous events of these past few hours of brazen skies and scorching ail is the destruction of the Roman Catholic Church propertx at Lismore Although not diiectlx due to bush fires, the xxeathet conditions of xesterddj were eminentlj favourable to the spread of the flames, and the destruction of the Convent and pi o Cathedral at Lismoie was made the moie certain by reason of the fuinace blast fiom the west that accompanied a temperature of I12deg Added to this was the insufficiencj of the water supplj, which should form the subject of fullf-st inqturx Great sxmoathx will be ielt and expressed foi Bishop Dojle, not onlj in his own diocese and amongst his fel low Churchmen in New South Wales, but also in Queensland and particulailj amongst his manj friends in this citj As to the prospects of Queens land xx ith* regard to tne weather, xx ai n ings have been issued from some sources of information or speculation that xx e are destined xxithin a xxeek 01 so to expeiience the force of another heavx cjclonic disturbance This, as one wntet po.nts out, is the c\ clone season, and it would not be surpiising if apprehensions of this natuie should be realised How far it is possible w 1th the limited data noxs at disposal to predict a distuibance of this kind fourteen da\s ahead maj xxell be doubted Ex en in England xxhere ob sei x allons and repot ts are fal more complete than xvith us serious com plaint is made (as appeals from an article îepublished in this issue) that the heavj gales and snowstoims of No x ember xseie altogethei unforeseen, and consequentlx caused more mis chief than if wai nings had been pub lished If unhappilx the piedictions of Captain Switzei and Mr Giddons aie icalised it is to be hoped that at least the Not them towns that haxe suffered so gieatlx (lining the last foxs xeais max escape on this occasion The need ot A thoroughlx up to date me teoiological equipment on the lines adopted in Ameiica is still felt in Quensland , but xve aie not just noxx in a condition hnanciallx to stand the necessarj outlaj Though public spiuted local effort, as in the case of 'looxxoombd, max be able to collect x .Unable infoimation xxe must exentu alix look to the Federal Government fot a comprehensive treatment of this highh important subject -
