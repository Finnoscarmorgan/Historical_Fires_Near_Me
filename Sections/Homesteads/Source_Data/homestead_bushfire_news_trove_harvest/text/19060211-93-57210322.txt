THE BOSH F3BES; " ! Fróm the Coastline to the Borders, Bed ruin's in command, The worst of ail marauders Kine Bushfire sweeps the land. His wanton roaring heralds, The flaming north wind tell Of fierce, auick-marchinjj perils The cavalry of Hell. From Dandenong to Daylesford, they sweep the earth and rise . To write red revolution across the molten skies, Out where the black clouds muster The lurid sheets of flame, Impart a hideous lustre To deeds of cruel shame. Wikl terror flies from them Ah woe ! the poor dumb stock. Fleet are the mountain horses, wild eyed, with tossing; manes Ah, woe ! the fleet wild horses, their ashes strew the r»lr>ins. Un. up the mountain racing, \- Where the towering blue-rmms rise The tongues of fire are chasing The black wreaths to the skies ; And armed with red disaster, And shod with bumin" hate, The «ea of names-the master Bolls to the border Gate. In front the smálin? homesteads from whence the settler,'- nv. Behind the blackened landscape, to snatch the blackened sky. From Loch to Leongatha The countryside's ablaze, A-fire the hills of heath«:, A-fire the waterways. Give me the band of battle. The hand of God in ire Before the toa? and rattle Of cruel, wanton Firo. The fierce, relentes fury, that roast« iu rampant pride The hapless Toora children and wastes ¿fae country side.
