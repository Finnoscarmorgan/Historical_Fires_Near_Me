A YOUNG WOMAN ROASTED ALIVE NEAR NORTHAMPTON. From a gentleman who received a tele- gram from Northampton, yesterday, we learn that an accident of an appalling cha- racter occurred at a place called Willow Gully, near that township, on Sunday last. From the brief particulars to hand it appears that the extreme heat of the day was the cause of a bush-fire breaking out in a paddock near the homestead of Mr. John Williams, who, together with some of his family and neighbours, was speedily on the spot and worked, hard for a consider- able time in extinguishing the flames. A daughter of Mr. Williams, named Lizzie, observing the great fatigue of those engag- ed with the fire, set to work and made some tea for their refreshment, a supply of which she hurried off with to her father, during which, unfortunately, the flames caught her clothes. The alarm being given of the poor girl's position, all who could do so hastened to her assistance, but in spite of their efforts to subdue the flames, by rolling the sufferer over on the ground, her underlinen caught the fire with remarkable rapidity,- the result being that her legs and body presented an almost roasted and, in some places charred, appearance. When the flames had but little more clothing to work upon, however, fire was got under but in a few hours afterwards poor Miss Williams breathed her last, being sensible of her terrible sufferings to the end.
