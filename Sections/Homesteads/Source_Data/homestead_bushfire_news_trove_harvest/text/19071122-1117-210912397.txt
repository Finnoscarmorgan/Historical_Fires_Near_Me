NINETEEN MILE NOTES. (From Our Own Correspondent..) Nineteen-Mile, Wednesday. .the bush-fire fiend has already made its appearance here. On Sunday last we had a real live "flame" at Webb's "kopje." The fire started in the lo cality of Oakagee siding, Qn Mr. El- liott's property, known as Webb's paddock, which was partly mullinis- ed, and, being unstocked, tE&se; was an enormous quanotity of dry grass;. The day was hot, and a good sea breeze set in towards evening <and ra pidly spread the flames. Webib'fS home stead, crops and all, narrowly escap ed hefrng burned, anid only for the little band of willing workers which turned out from Oakabolla, Oakland® and a number from the near farms, also the f ' lers, Webib's crop muslti have '/teen c-o nplebely destroyed. The Webb family are exceedingly grateful to those who worked so hand to save their crop. Albout 15cwt of hay was destroyed by the fire. How the out break originated is not known. It' as gratifying to notice the numjber of people who turn out to render as sistance at these fires. Messrs. A. C. and T. Burges and A. G. McDonald Wiore about the first on the scone of the (ire. McOIuskey's property, ad joining Webb's paddock, was also saved. Mrs. L. C. Burges, selff., of Oak- lands, met with a nasty accident a little time back. The sulky in which, she was riding came in contact with one of 'the gates, and capsized. Mrs. Burges was thrown on her shourxVLer, which has rAnsMi _ — V.lSII.-hUUA.-l'CUrJIU pain. She loft for Geraldtom by yes terday's train to undergo nicdiical treatment. I notice that Mr. A. G. McDonald, toaoher of the Oalcabella school, has got his schooV library completed. He ha® a fine collection of valuable books, and I feel sure that i the State school library at Webb's landing will hold its own with any of the 'other country schools. There is a good deal of sickness about just now in this lively little locality ; whooping cough atid influ enza being, somewhat prevalent.
