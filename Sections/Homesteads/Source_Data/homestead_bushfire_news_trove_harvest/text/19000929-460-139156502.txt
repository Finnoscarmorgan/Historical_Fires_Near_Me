La a fair ?eajoa i: would take b<re sheep to the acre to keep d^wn tbe grass on th:s land in eprlag and eany sammtr. Though the «pring growth bad tot vomaifcattd wben I raw this belt; the grass wis far coo heavy for merino sheep, and tie finn were en deavouring to buy ttore cattle to eat it down. This belt of dark soil does not border the river evenly, sometimes it is on one eide snd sometimes oa the other. Oc casionally it wit be four mile* broad, and in. some piac<s the red soi! runs right Bp to the nvjx bank. On liii bell z eBtatieoi qsantity oi fodder couid be conserved in a good season to keep the sbeep aiive oa the back country doling the very worst droaght. We pai«ed through extensive marshes and is goons caused by tb? outflow trom tbe river, acd arrived at the theep wasb. Here the steading wat not 2ft. above tbe sui-face of the river, and tbougb j tbe flood had gone down greatly the place ] was never flooded, aet^washiiig at Bar rawang ii now a thing of tbe jart, sad | tbe expensive plant has for some year* been i idle. The gteam-engine are now used for ] irrigating about lr0U0 acres of land which i has been laid down in lucerne. As might i be expected in :hb fef»lendidh- fertile land, tbe crass has taken possesion of the irri gated fields, and trill eoon kill the lucerne. Here there are some good-sized stacks of lucerne bav kept a& a reretve. A consider able cumber of tbe stud sheep are kept at "is place. Following the cours-e of the. nver down etreaifl through this magnifi cently fertile eofl was an experience 1 have had nowhere eke. Of what it can do an j idea may be gathered from one fact. Near | the wash-pool a bend of the river contain- j ing 100 acres kept 5,000 eheep for three i weeks, and then tbe grass was not eaten i down, for BOOD after a bush-fire swept across the place. On the way ire crossed the Bumboegin Creek, dose to where it; runs out ofthe Tjachlan. Originally this was a small c-reek that for the greater part of the year a man could step over. The great flood of 1870 enlarged the outlet, and now two-thirds of the water in the river runs <kWB the creek, which joins the parent stream a cons'derable distance fur ther down. At an outetation. named Mnl guthrie there is another effluent creek named the Mitchell, which promises to be increased in the same way as the Bumbog gin Creek. The bank is being rapidly car ried off-by ~tbe swirl of the water, and the volume or-the creek ig increasing. Here I gaw tbe greater number of the young stud sbeep, and found them all of the one"type, sturdy .bodies, on short legs, and with an excellent covering of wool. The tendency to wrinkle* on the skin was At noticeaWe [in these'sheep as in those I sair at the homestead. On the drive back we -passed through some extensive patches of crab hole country and wme red-«oil land, all-of which was so saturated with flood water that our horses were scarcely able to floun der through it. . The flood has dque a good, thing besides thoroughly saturating the subsoil; it has destroyed neatly all tihe rabbits. In my. drives .pver this large ptd perty I sair only, one rabbit. -I did jitot see any. of the bare places in the paatare that havt become so numerous and exten sive in Biverina since the commencement of the- drought." .
