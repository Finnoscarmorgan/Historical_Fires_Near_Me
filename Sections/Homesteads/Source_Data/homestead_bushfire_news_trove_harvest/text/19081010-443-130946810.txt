When the final ballot was an- nounced for the capital site, the re- sult was received with loud cheer- ing from all parts of the House. Members became so excited that the Prime Minister was compelled to secure a temporary adjourn- ment. All the N.S.W. representa- tives, with the exception of Ewing and Spence, voted for Yass-Can- berra.

Dalgety led up to the seventh ballot, when Yass-Canberra drew abreast, and Toomaites then went over to Yass-Canberra.
