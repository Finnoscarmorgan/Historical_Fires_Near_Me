This, ,pycr^ono will admit, is as it should be. It \Yas, euggested by,,one (6pe^|spc tl^at . a. short aession of Parliament should bo J held '.tp specially deal with °Uie ' mati'cr^^ljut^ 'as " tho Proraier . poinidd4 oiitp,1 tUisJ'is' not at all necessary.5 1 ^ri'w^He,shal^ds,off tho Execulivo^rGsU air'poWGr to :dt'al with any Bpecial'crisis- that'^•'^hay;{ari^jo', in ;thc country's affaira;'-anti >Parliament 'can'hold' tliein' accou'n tabled aiterwarHs if it *is considered uthat uthuir^iaction jhas not.,bcen.,guidcd/,iiy ^ujyrwisdom. lIn thiV instance 'there' is riot a repre sentative of tho' 'people, to whatever : party lio^is 'attached/"who^would not heartily- back kup -the *Promier~ifi k-'any Iiberul troatment ho determined; to extend to the settlers whom tho fires have either seriously crippled,' or wholly ruined. In fact, the public in* tercBts demand the vigorous carrying out of . such a policy.. Regarding tho tremendous losses suffered1 by settlers through this scourge, there should be no necessity to dilate at any length. Tho i columns of nil tho. newspapers in the State havo teemed with them I during tho week, for tho area over which tho fires swept was greater in magnitude than had ever been; the case previously in New South Wales. Of course, the • sufferers1 include UotK large and small landholders, 'but it is to the , latter class more particularly tho question of State assistance is of importance.' They form the bulk of the agricultural producers in the country, and tho largo majority are: occupants of land over which the Crown still possesses rights. A con siderable number, being, indeed, home stead selectors, arc' merely. Crown tenants, and can rightly look' to the Government' for1 even groaier con-, sidcratio'n than would , be extended under tho circumstances' hy a com passionate private landlord. In the caso; of, the latter, it could not be ex pected, howovcr generous ho might be, that the'element of self-interest .would be'.wholly eliminated from his conduct. But in the caso of the State, self interest means tho realisation of the greatest good for the greatest number," and the application of- -that principle, would, result in giving an effective start to all bona-fide selectors who have suffered heavily from this cala mity. Nor is thfero any need why the pecuniary assistance thus rendered by tho. ;Stato should be viewed in any way as charity. It would be in reality no nioro than the timely succour that would be extended by a judicious creditor in time of stress to a body of debtors whose financial recovery would prove to him of ; the greatest ultimate benefit^ jn'^sutjh -a'Scase the clement1'of fai thl( would - have »tbf bo Ail?; lowed considerable exercise as to tho valuo of the security that could be offered for further advances, and the State would be equally justified under present circumstaucos in accepting greater risk as to repayment of hmns than prudence would dictate at other times. In this instance^ the policy of tho Government'should be, first, to, seo that things .are so ordered as, to prevent any interference with our future productive resources, and, secondly, to mitigate hardship to the; extent that is possible. It will, ve think, be found possible by wise action to' accomplish both these objects, without involving the State in any serious loss. Tliero are, no doubt; hundreds of instances all through the burned out districts which, will call loudly for such .aid as can be rendered, | by private charity, in addition to all I that can reasonably bo douo by . the j State for the sufferers, and it is for the relief needed in ;tlieso cases, such a; fund as that started by the Lord Mayor will bo useful. \ It. can, ' we think', be taken for granted that that, fund will bo largely added to by local subscriptions, throughout the State. That thc^clnims to bo met from this source will be large, and of a nature not to. bo withstood,. goes without saying, and liberal subscriptions wii!; therefore, be required from private! donors to meet the demands. - Tho generosity shown, however, at the Sydney Town Hall meeting, leaves little room for • doubt. but that the people of Now South W^les will . bo found willing to perform their duty on this occasion as nobly as they havo dono oii so many former occasions of public suffering, " At present it is scarcely possiblo to form oven an approximate estimate of tho. losses that havo been sustained, but we Bincorely hope that the total area of crops destroyed in this dis trict will be found, much less than was ut-one time thought would ; be -the case. "It may probably also bo dis covered, when things have settled down* that fewer stock have been de stroyed ' than was at, first feared. Tho numbers of homeless families; howovor, the hundreds of'squaro miles of blackened and fenceless country, and tho . tales, of. suffering which arc- iso lated ^on . all sides; bear: testimony • to' the real nature of (he calamity by which tho people were overtaken. Tho one great matter for congratulation in connection with the visitation; ; is that, by some providential meanB,' it was warded off from tho more important wheat-producing areas of the Wagga country., Had it penetrated to tho region- of which Coolamon and Gan main may be considered as tho centres, then rum would indood havo been wrought -of a; much more terrible character than it has been our duty to ichronicle. Surely, without wishing to cast bluino anywhoro for what lias I occurred, 'a word of praise is. duo for 1 tho extreme ! watchfulness exorcised to prevent and suppress lire outbreaks on tho part of the settlers in'the locali* ties'referred'to. The whole subject of firo prevention is, however, one worthy of greater consideration than we can ui present bestow upon ty.
