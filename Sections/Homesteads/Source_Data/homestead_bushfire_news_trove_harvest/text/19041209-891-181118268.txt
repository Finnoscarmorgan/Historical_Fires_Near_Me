Theirs is the iirst party known to. have taken a four-wheeled vehicle over that route. They report that the country is looking magnificent; being most desirable * grazing- lend. At Avon Downs there were 40,000 sheop *-and 35,000" cattle,...'and at Alexandria Downs, one of the lar gest • .cattle stations- in- Australia, there were 35,000 head. The .travel lers had considerable^ trouble .with bush,fires, which were caused, largely by the blacks, -and were very, preva lent. On one occasion their camp was surrounded, and they were, com pelled to drive through a ring fire | to escape. - The blacks we're very peaceable," .though - rather cheeky. They-, avoid travellers whom they know to-be armed.- -One * large sta tion,. Eva Downs, was burned- com pletely .out by husn iiiv„s." which ex tended right up to the homestead. fThe .country generally is undulating downs; with very little tiuiberfc there 'being-..*scattered-flumps .of- ^gidya,; icofrkwdod, and coolibalv at long -in tervals. TJie runs are well but not permanently - watered. The stations' are of immenFe size, and are separ ated by great distances. There are no fences, and the cattle'arc allowed to roam at will.. No rabbits were seen, but- gama: vwgs-' abundant Should a route ever heN:ontemplated for a transcontinental railway, it would, offer no : engineering difficul ties, and .a great tract of pastoral country would, be opened, and- pro? bably; yield. a. large .revenue. The distance', travelled- by' the party was 4,222. miles. •'
