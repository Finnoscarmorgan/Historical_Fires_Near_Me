,"A Splendid Outlook. Mr. Lee, Minister for Works, re-~ turned on Tuesday from a flying visit to the electorate represented by. Mr. Ball, M.L.A. The Minister found the country around Albury in a very promising state. Copious rains have made the prospects for the coming wheat season excellent, while there is plenty of fodder for stock and an excellent wool clip is assurecl. He travelled the country which two years- ago was - swept --by bush.fires,^ and found no" trace"- of the devastation 'then -^wrought? Homesteads that succumbe 1 to the flames have been re-erected, fences that disappeared have been put up again, and -there is nothing to tell the tale of loss and suffering that the fires carried with them. On the other 'hand, there is a larger area under cultivation this year, than, usually, and" -fanners are looking forward to a heavy crop. The demand for land is brisk, with prices on the up grade, and several blocks near the Walla Walla station were sold the other, day at Â£6 per acre. The farmers would not mind if no more rain fell before, next spring. '* "
