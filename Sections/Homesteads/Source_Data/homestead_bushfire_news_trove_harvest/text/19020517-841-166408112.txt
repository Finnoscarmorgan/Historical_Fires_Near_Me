FROM PROSPERITY TO POVERTY". A SAD RESULT OF A BUSBFIllE Perhaps the sadost circumstances re sulting from a bushfire is one which occurred in Winnipeg, Canada, in J >ine last year. Benjamin Spencer ploughed in the fields when he was a lad of ten. He began at a salary of a dollar a wee1', and worked on the same fields for twenty years, during which time, owing to his saving habits ^ind sobriety, he saved 1,000 dollars. Eventually he purchased the farm from his employer, and married. FiVe years after his marriage he de cided to go with his wife for a trip to Europe. Foolishly he drew all his money out of the Bank in notes, stating, in country parlance," lie would not trust any Bank while he was away. Two days before his de parture a hn occurred on his farm. In 9 v orfc time the fiames spread to the homestead, and every cent, of Spencer s money was destroyed and the unfortunate farmer became penniless. What cannot occur in a day? One moment we may be well and healthy, the next ill-health naay strike us to the ground. This calamity may be warded off by taking Bile Beans for Biliousness. They act gently on the liver, stimulate the whole diges tive organism, make wornout lives new and bring perfect health even to the most siekly. Therefore have a care and " nip in the bud" that which you think might hereafter give you trouble. ♦ ■ A school boy on being asked what a zebra was, replied that he was a donkey with a football shirt on.
