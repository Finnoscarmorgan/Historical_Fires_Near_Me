BUSH FIRES IN VICTORIA. The heat register on February 7 in Melbourne was the highest recorded (writes our Melbourne corres pondent) for 30 years. In the metropolis at 3 p.m. the shade reading was a fraction below 110 degrees, and in parts of the country 116 degrees was recorded. The maximum in the sun, as noted at the Observatory, was 158.2. Bush fires in various parts of the bush, notably in the North Eastern district, added to the burning force of the sun's rays. Unfortunately, a poor ?settler named Charles Jft'Intosh fell a victim to the bush fire at Branxholme. At Condah, in the same district, the Catholic church was burnt, whilst a similar fate be fel the Presbyterian chapel at Allendale. To add to the discomfort in Melbourne, a cyclonic duststorm with a velocity of 50 miles an hour raged between 6 and 7 o'clock. The Sydney express train had to run the gauntlet between Avenel and Longwoodâ€” a densely-wooded and rugged patch of country, which was one mass of flame. The destruction of grass and fencing is enormous, inflicting grave loss on the unfortunate settlers, who otherwise would have had an unusually good reason. Additional particulars of the terrible bush-fires' work state that four boys were burnt to death near Birregurra, on the Eulong and Colac line, whilst a dozen home steads were destroyed in the Branxholme district.
