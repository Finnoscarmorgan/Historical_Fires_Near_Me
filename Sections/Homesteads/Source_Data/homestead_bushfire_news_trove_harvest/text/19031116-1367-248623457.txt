BUSH FIRES. There is much virtue in the adage that to bo forewarned is to for armed j with a view to creating timely interest in the subject, and perhaps prompting some sort of rude organisation with the object of co-operating in cases of emergency, we particularly direct the attention of our district landholders to the great amount of grass and herbage which will presently be dry aud inflammable, and to the very grave risks of bushfires which confront them in every quarter ! That these risks should begin to weigh upon the minds of peop' -.rrounded by such abundance, is to be expected, because the prospects of a big outbreak, of bushfire during the summer months are anything but re- assuring. The difficulties in the way of organisation n-i> very considerable, and where the C. .i duty of cach is to his own acres, not likely to be altogether effective. But during the hot summer months could not some simple understanding be arrived at amongst the landholders, large and small, to have horses within easy reach, to be on the look out for the ascending smoke which is the dread signal of the bush fire, and to converge as rapidly as possible upon the locality of the outbreak so that it may be fought before the hold and spread are too great. And if bandy water carts, with tanks full, to supply the fire fighters, and posj sibly to damp tracks, were kept in readiness at intervals on the homesteads, tlrey would constitute useful agencies and adjunct* should the population have to fight the fires. One other thing the landowners can do, before tbe grass gets toe dry, and because there is abundance and to spareâ€”they can burn trails around their homesteads and across suitable places for checking bush fires; and this will not only add to the safety of the often helpless inmates of homesteads, but the breaks -so burnt often prove excellent me&ns; of turning the fires or enabling the fighters to make a successful Btand. But such organisation or understanding as may be found practicable, and such other precautions as may be deemed advisable, should be attended to without delay, because nobody can contemplate a fierce outbreak of bushfires here this year without a sense of dismay.
