WINTON (From Our Own Correspondent.) One of the most disastrous bush fires of the season occurred a few days back. It started near Olio and was seen by the pas sengers on the train to leap the railway after the train had passed. It burned for the best part of three days. Wyora, Manuka, Knapdale, and Sesbania all suf fered, the fire sweeping within two miles of the homestead at the latter station. Wyora selection was the worst sufferer. It is stated that 30,000 acres of country were devastated and 400 sheep burned to death, while many more than this number were more or less scorched. This is the first, in fact, the only bushfire of any note in this district this season. The grass in many places is long and dry, and though fire plough tracks are of use on ordinary occa sions in checking the progress of a fire, they are of little value when the flames are fanned by a high wind, as was the case in this instance. Sesbania lost a few rams and a considerable quantity of fencing was destroyed. A fire started at a bush man's camp. When boiling his billy a gust of wind carried the blaze into the grass and it got away. Thus do large conflagra tions spring from the smallest of begin nings. A case of considerable interest was heard at the Police Court to-day before Messrs. W. J. Gardner, F. W. Mley, and P. W. ' dough, 33. V. tee Bow, a. Chinaman, summoned $ young man named Edirard Spike for assault The evidence snowed that some small boys were annoying toe Chinaman by . throwing misBfies at him, and he ga-re chase and enptuxed 'one aboufe eight years of age in another block. The defendant saw the Chinaman with Itis hand in tbe act of striking die child, and rushed out of a. shopand ' punched ** the Chinamen, knocking him- doid and releas ing the boy. TheCbilianian had his face cut and his eye bruised, ana Dr. Archdall treated him. The Beach found tbe de fendant guilt}- of assault, and- fined' him 10s., with £1 Is. professional costs, £1 Is. medical expenses, and ^1 Is. witnesses^ expenses and costs of Court. TUo seems a big figure for a man to pay for pre venting what he apparently thought would Considerable excitement was created! earlier in the week by the news that « woman named Mrs. Cmne -was nassing from1 town. It appears that she came ui a few days before from tie Aynmira Downs mail change and was admitted to the Hospital ; but she left tiicre at Mat teS, going to a Mrs. Ireland's. On Toes day afternoon she disappeared: from there, x and as she did not return or go back to tbe Hospital, the police were conmumi csted with. Ultimately the woman waa discovered in dose proximity l» the 7 Ayrshire sail change, having apparently; ' covered the forty miles on foot. For- ' tunaxely the weather was cool through ont. The Geach Dramatic Company played here on Friday to one of the largest houses seen in. Wilrtdn for many a. day. - ' The company had sot. a little troohle in ? , getting over bom Longreaco. Mr. Wat- ' sou's motor lorry was engaged, and thfi conqiany were billed to appear here on the 8th instant ; but the lorry bicfce down about seventeen miles, from l^mg Feach, and ft was not OtttH the night of tihe 15th instant that it got here OTth the scenery and barrage. The company^ ' will play again to-mgii, witch v,ili con clude the season. A^meeting ot the Hospital Committee wns held on Tuesday I*sU There vu ? large attendance, iiw-lw^wift Messrs. K.
