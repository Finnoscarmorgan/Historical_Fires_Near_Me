Northampton Notes, Â» (From Our Own Correspondent. ) Again bushfires have been raging during the present week in the Apper- tarra and Alma Areas. I am given to understand that considerable dam- age has been done, Mr. Alex. Rob, of Alma, being tee worst sufferer, his large farm having been completely swept by the fire fiend. From this side of Udandarra Brook, where it would appear tee fire started, a big strip of country, extending for miles in a northerly direction, and embrac ing many homesteads, is now a smoul- ing, blackened country, where but a few days ago there . was in many places abundance of summer feed. Owing to the strong south-easterly winds blowing at tee time, the flam ing bush was carried along at a rapid pace, causing double exertion to tee firebeaters, with almost hopeless re sults in tee vicinity of the respective homesteads. Another fire started in the vicinity of Iga, and during its onward devas tating course destroyed thousands of acres of good Teed, as it swept through Messrs. Jas. and John Rey nolds' and Joseph Bundy's extensive c.p. lease holdings in tee Appertarra A. A. Elsewhere on tee same area the feed lias suffered considerably, and, 1 understand, much fence has been des troyed in the tracks of the fire fiend. Judging from the large quantities of machinery of various kinds, and oUicr material still being carted to the Badara lead mine, evidently the Smelting Company intend to give tee mine agood trial. Manager Dunstan is vigorously carrying on tee erection of machinery and qtbsr necessary works,' preparatory to? making d start. During tee past -week we have- been blessed with some pretty hot wea ther. accompanied sometimes by sou therly busters, and sometimes a de lightful easterly wind, teat strongly reminds one of a baker's oven.
