FATAL GUN ACCIDENT NEAR OINGJN.—A MAN SHOT DEAD.. From (jingin we learn that a gun accident occurred on Wednesday last, near that township, at the homestead of Mr. William King, owing to which an old man, known by the sobriquet of 'Ginger,' lost his life. It appears from the particulars sent us of the occurrence that during the morning of the day noon which the sad mishap occur red aU hands employed en. Mr. King's farm were engaged in extinguishing a bush-fire that had. broken out close to the house, and, their efforts having proved successful, Mr. King directed 'Ginger' to return to the farm for the purpose of watering the stock. Upon a number of fig-trees which surrounded the house some 'squeakers' had congregated throughout the day, and shortly after the man's re turn to the house he directed one of Mr. King's daughters, a littie girl named May, about twelve years of age, to bring him a gun, in order that he might shoot some of the. birds. The eiin was loaded and was kept in one of the back rooms, and owing to the child cot bringing it as quickly as he wished, he endeavoured to hurry her by saying, 'Make baste. May; I want to shoot these squeakers before they flyaway.' The child, holding the fifan in her right hand, increasing her speed as she advanced, tripped, and, falling forwards, the hammer of the gun struck the floor, causing it to explode in a direct line with 'Ginger,' whereupon he fell dead on the spot, the contents having lodged in his head. The body was shortly afterwards removed to the room formerly occupied by the deceased, and a coroner's inquest was held on the following day, a verdict of 'acci- dental death ' being recorded thereat. [Since the above was written we have ascertained that the correct name of the deceased was Thomas Bench. — Ed.]
