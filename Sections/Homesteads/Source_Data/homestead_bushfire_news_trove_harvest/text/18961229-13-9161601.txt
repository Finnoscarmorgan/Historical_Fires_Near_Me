FIRE AT GEMBROOK GEMBROOK, Sunday. This district has had to endure during the past week the most extensive bush fires on record. Fires broke out simultaneously on Sunday and Monday in various parts of the district, and continued during the week, clearing off scores of miles of bush under- growth and a great deal of fencing. Here and there a stable or outbuilding has mgone, but so far I have not heard of any habita- ions or crops having suffered. The greatest danger has arisen from the fire getting into the dry tops of the rung timber, from whence shaowers of sparks and bits sof burn- ing bark fall on to the adjacent ground, sometimes being carried a great distance in the wind. In a number of cases people have had to work night and day to save their homesteads. On Christmas morning a ndozen young fel- lows were busily at work wjith buckets and pannikins dosing the sparks as they fell on a long range of bark sheds containing some tons of hay. The blackened bush and the miserably stunted appearance of hte crops has given the district a very miser- able appearance.
