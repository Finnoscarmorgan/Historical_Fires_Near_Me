lIovcliHt. ARTHUR LANDON, THE AUSTRALIAN BUSHMAN. BY ANCUS MACLEAN. Atrruon OF " BAhlRY BLOOIFsIELD," OHAPTER IV. THE WAlEtING, Frank Anstey had duly entered on his vo. cation as a tutor, and a school-house had been ereated in a nice spots halfway between the two head stations, so that the children of both familieojsad equal advantage in at tending school. Anstey boarded a month alternately at each homestead, and became by degrees a great favorite with every person through his gentlemanly behavior, modest and unassuming manner, and, above all, his scholastic acquirements. He seemed to be a perfect master of several languages, besides all branches of an English education. His former history was, however, a subject of mystery.. He evaded on every occasion when asked to touch on it, and, as interrogation on this point appeared displeasing to him, noone afterwards troubled him. At certain times, however, unguarded expressions would slip from him regarding fashionable society at home, which indicated that he had mixed with such, and had come from a good stock.. Mrs. Landon, who was a better judge, and had mixed herself among the aristocracy in her earlier days, had no doubt of Anstey's descent from some branch of that society, and, accordingly, paid more regard to his comforts. These surmises she often ex pressed to her eldest daughter, who emulated her mother's bearing towards that gentle man. The warm hearted Lizzy soon felt greatly attached to the young tutor, and sympathised with his seeming reverses. Anstey, although distant and shy towards every other person, became more free with this meek and ingenuous girl, and, by de grees, a mutual and tehder understanding was established between them, Kathleen Haley and Lizzy Landon at. tended school whenever their services at home could be dispensed with, and riding to and from it proved a nioe recreation for them in addition to the needful instructions they received from the young teacher, who paid great attention to their instru-o tion. The tutor's partiality to her companion did not escape Kathleen; but her own mind being quick and fertile she kept pace with Lizzy in each lesson, notwithstanding An stey's particular care of the latter's studies. The usual rides taken by Arthur and Kath. leen were now "knocked on the head," (colonially speaking). This sudden change in their former innocent amusement being the resulttf that unfortunate private acting of "Romeo and Juliet" in the bush, for somehow or another Kathleen had been siezed ever since with a fit of shyness that she could hardly look in Arthur's counten. ance without blushing or dropping her eyes before his. Arthur himself felt rather " queer" about the region of thebeart when. ever he gazed at the beautiful and blushing face of his former playmate; nor did he press her afterwards to join him in those rides without her little and eldest brother Johnny, orLizzy his own sister, being part of the company. Attending school was another excuse for declining these tempting rides by Kathleen, so that poor Arthur had to undertake his equestrian excursions with no better company than his own. He often rested about the middle of the day at that memorable waterhole, the scene of " Romeo and Juliet's" introduction,andruminated for hours upon the sweet kiss he hadatolen from Kathleen's pouting lips. " What a happy fellow Anstey most feel," he thought to him self, " in Kathleen'e company every day." Little did Arthur suspect that Anstey's heart was at that moment in the safe keeping of his own sister Lizzy. But it is an old but true saying, "love is blind." Arthur had no eyes for any one but Kathleen, and although he was very partial to Anstey he was yet moved by vague apprehensions that the hadsome tutor, would " out him out" in Kathleen's affections. Jealousy, we must confess, began to sting his young heart on considering Kathleen'se preference for attend ing school to the usual rides. Whenever Arthur took a turn round the run he invariably called at the schoolhouse "to have a .look at the scholars," as he termedit, but if he had said " to have a look at Kathleen," it would have been nearer the mark. Another object he had in view was to remark lc;, Anstey and Kathleen behaved towards one another. On these occasions when leaving the schoolhouse, and cracking his etockwhip in order to call his dogs, "Kate Kearney," Kathleen's steed-which was always with Lizzy's horse enclosed in a small paddock attached to the echoolhbouse- would set up a constant neighing, wishing to get away with Arthur's horse as of yore. Kathleen on hearing this impatience in her favorite steed, would run out, under the pre tence of quietening and preventing Kate Kearney from breaking away. Arthur thought 

 these actions on the part of the girl augure. favorably, and waved his hand in token . ! adieu, which Kathleen acknowledged wi her white pocket handkerchief. But Arthur had seen the two laree natrly dro: which coursed down each rosy cheek, ai. which were carefully removed by the :...' handkerchief before the owner re-enter the schoolhouse, his heart would not hb.a ! suffered such oppression as alllioted it wb?; taking his rounds over the ranges. His sister Lizzy, however, who se . e were more penetrating, and could read m correctly another girl's heart-bavial: small experienco herself lately-detew . some traces on Kathleen's lovely ; i. tenance; and easily guessed the carie. She did not wish, however, to reveal hc: discovery to either of the lovers for e while, for fear of creating confusion, until one day at noon, when the scholars had a short e ., as usual, Lizzy and Kithleen strolleï¿½ towards a shady tree under which they sat, when the former broached the delicate sub. ject as follows: " How is it, Kathleen, that you are alwaya so quiet since the school commenced, If you remember, how full of fun and joy yno used to bebefore? I do not think you lik le a r n in g a t a ll; " . .- - . ' .. . . " Indeed I do, Lizzy, as much as an3 one; but I was too giddy before, and since I am growing older and more sensible, I sup pose I can see my former flightiness." "But I don't think it is flighty to be lively, Kathleen, especially for a person that is naturally so, like you. There must be some other cause. Now, confess the truth, wouldn't you rather ride as formerly with Arthur in the bush than attend school ?" "What put that idea into your head, Lizzy? You surely want to tease me." "No indeed, Kathleen, I noticed several times when Arthur called here in the morn. ing, and not later than to-day, when you went out to quieten your mare, that you wiped your eyes as if there were tears in them." "Oh what a sharp creatureyou are, Lizzy I I did not expect you would take notice. To tell the real truth,I like riding very much, as you'know well, but 1 am quite sure learn ing is better for me." " That's not answering my question, Kath. leen. Would you as soon ride with me or any other person as with Arthur 2" This was a home thrust for poor Kathleen, who colored deeply, and bent her eyes to the ground, but, after a pause, gained courage to say, "You are a dreadful tease, Lizzy. Now I'll put a question to you, and see if you'll answer it candidly. Would you learn your lessons so well from any other teacher as from Mr. Anteey ?" It was now Lizzy's turn to blush. She had no idea that Kathleen had penetrated her own secret, and so to turn the tables on her so effectualy. It is most remarkable, and has often been noticed, this precociousness of the Australian youth! Here were two innocent girls, not having as yet attained their fourteenth year, and who had never associated with any other young people experienced in love matters, but purely led by the instincts of their own unsophieticalei hearls; and yet the one oould read and penetrate the deep re ceases of the other's mind through her own love. They gazed long and strad fastly in each other's eyes, while their cheeks mantled with bright crimson, until their eyes bent with confusion to the ground. What meaning and confidence that steady look portended. Each was in full possession of the other's secret without the aid of speech which their native bushfulness refused to ntter. A cloeerfriendship could not possibly before this exist between them, but now a sealed secret boundit still firmer, the purport of which they need not utter even to one another, for their eyes told plainer than the lips could express. The one was not afraid that the other would tell her tale aloud. It was an understood compact, with neither words nor writing to bind it. Lizzy was the first to speak by remark. ing: "Lot us go in. I see the children enter ing the schoolhouse." No more was spoken on the subject for years after; for they were both too young and modest. Poor children, little they im agined that day what troubles and disap. pointments were in store for them. On .resuming their lessons and going through their several examinations, Ansley noticed more than usual delicacy and shy ness in Lizzie's manner, and he thought she shrunk from him whenever he approached her, her pale face also took a brighter hue, and her liquid eyes bent more before his gaze than usual. He had neverbeforebeheld such modesty and simplicity combined with lovliness. Lizzy, on the other hand, knowing that Kathleen was in possession of her secret, and that her eyes were constantly upon her felt more shy and nervocs whenever the young teacher addressed or drew near her, to point out some subject in her lessons, and whenever she stole a glance at him she al ways saw some fresh attraction or good quality in him. She knew that the sound of his voice had more softness and music in it whenever he addressed herself, and there fore indulged in some hopes that he thought more of her than any person, even Kathleen, although far prettier than herself, as she im agined. This innocent and rural life wore on a pace without any significant interruption, while the young parties concerned daily gained more confidence in one another's society. The shyness which characterised the young girls, on the first revelation of their budding love,wore off by degrees; while they nourished the sweet passion in their own tender bosoms, without breathing a syllable even to one another of the novel secret, until an incident-came to pass which alarmed or dicturbed the peace of one of the interesting couples. It was when Anstey was passing his time or boarding at Haley's, that Lizzy rode as usual to school, and, approaching the house before any of the others arrived, she beheld a horseman leaving it in a great hurry, and galloping away through the bush in a dif ferent direction. The incident surprisedher a little, perceiving that the person must be a stranger; however, she kept on her way and arrived at the schoolhouse, and putting her horse in the paddock as usual, entered the hut. The Australian bush children, being from their youth accustomed to track cattle or horses in the forest, where a distant view cannot be obtained owing to the thickly timbered country they live in, acquire won derful sharpness in detecting fresh tracks on the ground either of man or beast. Lizzy Landon was no exception to the generality of bush children, for she had often tracked her own horse in order to enjoy a ride on its back, or to visit Kathleen. On this morning she detected the foot prints of both the strange horse and its rider who, apparently, had been inside the school house. It must be acknowledged, although a courageous young woman like all other bush girls, that she felt a little uneasy when enter. ing, but nothiog that could cause her alarm was seen inside. Everything was in its proper place, just as it had been left the evening before; but on approaching the schoolmaster's desk she beheld a slip of paper with some writing on it in a scrawl. ing hand lying on the centre. Wondering what could be the purport, she bent over the desk, and without touching the paper read the following. words: " It Frarn Austey does not clear out of the country in 

 I':sticiks ho may find when too late, that .ï¿½ oInec of tlad wilt drive him farther." S'e? terrible threat was neither dated or ',.c!, save l,; thefigure of a horseshoe at poor girl almost fainted, while she ti?,.e rn thl fleor aghast, and unable to move S. -:bile, until she heard the tramlling of : be young scholare with their master ue'i? chanically took her book and S:r e: on the nearest seat, while ?very : is o r body felt as if frozen. , . ".ho held trembled in her hnds, _ , , n which her eyes were fixed .?e:ircd with mist. When Anste had euietrd at the head of his juvenile flock with heaith and animation illuminated in ,heir countenance, Lizzy raised her swimming eyes, vwhich encountered her lover's when he exclaimed: "Lizzy what ails you? Are you not well '" Quito well, I thank you," she feebl re. pliea; dropping her eyes again. "It does not seem so by your looks. You ought to remsin at'home if you don't feel well,"' Anstey added, with a soft and aniouse eztresion, . . -i le' as " te." replied Liccey, without raieing her eyes. The tutor approached his seat, fearing that his ador. able Lizzy had heard something to-his dis advantage, hut on espying the mysterious Flip of paper he picked .i up and read its contents. Lizzy watched hie countenance with eagernees,.when she beheld his face as. sume an ashy paleness, which was afterwards succeeded by a scornful and haughty expres sion. He rested his brow on his hand for a few seconds, as if meditating, and then raised his eyes which encountered Lizzy's gaze. A look of sympathetic meaning exchanged between them on that occasion which de. manded an explanation on the part of Anostey, who instantly tore up the paper into small fragments, pitching them into the fireplace, and then began pacing the floor ab. straetedly. It being Saturday, the children conse. quently had an afternoon's play, while Arthur, Anstey and the two young girls were to have a ride or hunt after kangaroos as usual. On this day, after killing the first, and the dogs having sighted a second, Arthur and Kathleen, as a mattter of course, (and having the speediest horses) gave chase, when Anstey, as if purposely, told Lizzy not to hurry, as the ground was too rough, and the latter interpreting the hint, consented, After several common place remarksi Anstey, while riding slowly by her side, commenced the following conversation, the substance of which shall be the subject of another chapter. CHAPTER V, FRANK ANSrTEY S CONteoSSON, "If I am not mistaken, Lizzy," began Frank, alter a pause, "you have read the slip of paper left on my desk by some un known hand this morning?" " I have Mlr. Anstey, I hope there was no harm in it." "Not much so far, yet I had rather you had not seen it. However, as it has hap pened so, I consider myself jus:ificd in making some explanations regardine it which I would not have done nare you inorant of the thieat the lines conveyed. Moreover, I am more willing to make you my confidant over any other living soul in Australia, for reasons which I shall mentior by-and-by. One of these is, that Ithinkyou feel more interest in my welfare than any other. I will give you a part of my history, which I know will be safe in your keeping, and which "will also justify certain pretun sions on my part and my character in your eyes. " You are but a yonng and unexperienced girl as yet, nevertheless, I am sensible that you possess more wisdom and judgment besides many other qualities-than girls of maturer years. These good qualities were partly instilled in your mind by your excel lent parents-particularly your accomplished mother-but your own natural meek temper, added to a virtuous mind, completed your good character. Do not imagine that I mean to flatter you, for it would ill befit a tutor to encourage vanity in his pupils, nor need you wonder at the gravity and formality which characterise my remarks, for I feel that my situation in the vicinity of villains who may take away my life at any moment, and partly in whose power I am unfortunately placed, demands serious consideration on my part. "You and your kind friends may possibly have suspected already that I have seen better days. This supposition is perfectly correct, and, although I still withhold even from you my real name, I will give you a short sketch of myhistory. "My father is an estated nobleman in England, and a descendant of an ancient titled family. I, being the third and youngest eon, nad Deen sene to college very young, where I rapidly became master of many branches of education. Through hard study and some natural abilities, I contrived to make myself very conspiouous for my years; but, unfortunately, through bad company, and too much confidence in my own superi ority and cleverness, I fell into the snares of gamblers. There was one of my fellow-students in particular who held a powerful influence over me, and into whose wicked toils I at last fell. This was a son of one of my father's bitterest enemies in political matters, both having seats in Parliament. We, the sons,cared little about our father's differences, which, instead of weakening, rather cemented our friendship. I, being the younger of the two, was readily led by my experienced, but, alas, wily companion. '".I must state hero, that my father wee very severe and parsimonious regarding my allowance. He returned a stern refusal to my applications for some additional amounts to pay my debts. I informed my would be friend and companion in gambling, and he advanced several emall sums, which eventu. ally increased to some amount. To discharge these"debts of honor," I:was at aloes how to raise money, when my" friend," in an evil hour, proposed the following desperate ex pedient. "This was to draw a bill of LS00, at six months, and that as I could imitate my father's handwriting to perfection, I should forge his name. On my protesting against such an unlawful course, my companion ex. plained in his own insinuating and plausible manner, that I need not fear, as he himself when receiving his half year'st allowance along with my own, would take up the bill before its maturity. Besides our chances of winning were set before me, At last he gained his point, and drew up the bill him.. self, and I, like a fool, never as much as examined the amount, but forged my father's signature. "The money was duly raised by my com panion, who paid me my share, or balance of the L,00, which sum followed my other losses at play. The bill, when coming due, could not be met, and, consequently, my father, being advised of the same, soon found out, or judged, how it originated. "I shall never forget his letter to me on the subject. I then discovered, that instead of the amount being L00, my unscrupulous confederate had made it L5000. My father's note was short and explicit, holding out no hopes, merely stating that he " would allow the law to take its course," and if I wished 

 to save myself from transportation my only chance was to leave the country and escape at once; for he did not mean to defend or acknowledge me over afterwards. " I took the hint at once, and shipped my. self on board a craft bound for Callao. The voyage round Caps Horn was accomplished without any accident until we arrived on the coast of Chili. One night on sailing too near the land the vessel struck on a sunken rock, and soon went to pieces. Not a soul escaped but myself. After floating for half a day on a spar, I was picked up by a fishing boat. * I need not mention all the hardship I went through for two years among the Spaniards or natives of that place. My principal occupation was riding after the cattle, which gave me much experience in riding, for they are the most daring horse. men in that part that ever were in bthe world. At last I found my way to Callao, and having enough of South America, I re solved on working my passage in a-vessel bound for Melbourne, where I safely ar rived, but without a single dollar in my pocket. " I happened to be in a hotel there, on tHf'first day'of oar laiidingin canipainywith some of our sailors, who were pressing on me to drink at the bar, as I had been a great favorite with them all, when I overheard Jack Tantrum inquiring for a good horse man or stock-driver. I immediately offered my services, and told him where I had gained my experience, whetn we came to terms at once. But I was very ignorant of the ser. vices which Jack intended for me, otherwise, I would rather have starved in the streets of Melbourne than have bound myself to such .an employer. " You must excuse me not relating all the transactions which passed between myself and the horse-dealer. I am bound by a solemn oath not to divulge his station, or place of abode to a living mortal. But this much I ean reveal to you, and trust you will keep it a secret. It will partly explain the threat that was made in that paper this morning. Jack is afraid, I suppose, that on my leaving him and living in this district, I may reveal his ambush, and that, since I know his real character, I might be trouble. some to him hereafter. But, unfortunately, as I have already mentioned, I am myself partly implicated (although inadvertently) which places me in his power, to a certain extent, should he be wicked enough to exer. eise such treachery. Being a stranger in the colonies, ho,I ononne occasion, sent me with another of his men for four horses which he told us he had bought the "chance of," and which were running in a certain gully among the mountains. We found the horses where he told us and brought them to his run, branding them as usual like his other pur. chases with the "horseshoe." Some time after this,as I happened to look atsome papers where rewards were offered for strayed and stolen horses, I read to my consternation a discription of the very horses we branded. I pointed out the article to Jack, who only smiled, and remarked that "Ihad put my foot in it," and that he could" sell me" any day he wished. I immediately understood his meaning, and resolved from that day forth to get rid of such a dangerous associa tion. You may therefore believe how glad I was in accepting the billet I now hold, 1Lziy." Li::;:y Landon who listened with great at tenrion to the young man's history and strange revelations, intensely felt for his un. vale situation, and eagerly exclaimed: S" )h, Mlr. Anstey, why do you remain here where your life is in danger every.moment? You outght to fly at once." " And do !!t, really wish me to leave this place for leer ?' replied the young man, lay. ing a s?.ess on the pronoun, and looking mouroini;; into her duak eyes. The artless girl bent her looks orn the mane of her steed. After a short p?u?e abe anewered: "I am for your own safety, which is above every other conrsidoertioo." "Ar d if there were no danger to my life "or liberty, would you wish me to remain Lizzy ?" "I would indeed be ocry sorry that you should leave us, replied the ingenuous creature, with downcast eyes and biushing face. Anstey, who watched her eagerly, at last added "I am glad to hear yes say so, Lizy, and now comes the most delioate and p:eciout part of my confessions. I wreld rathe chance Jack's "ounce of lead,"',han iart wit:, you, for you must know .at last that lo:ve you with my whole heart and soul. I kr, : it is foolish to nourish such a paeie?, fc? i have no hopes that your parents would sent to give their daughter to a poor ad turer like me; besides that I have no i :. c or hope of a return of my affection. ' !is; say you, Lizzy, can I hope ?" SOh, Mr. Anstey, what is the use : n saying anything? You are such a :: nobleman's son." "Don't call me Mr. Anstey, Lizzy, sa;e: we are alone. I like Frank better from yo~ and as for my being a nobleman's son, it will avail me nothing.. I do not want pro. mises from you, for it would be taking no advantage of your youth. I shall be quite content now, if you say that I am not imdif terent to you. Let me hear but one encour. aging word." "I do love you, Frank, better than all the world. But, ohl leave this part, for I shall never rest while you are in danger." " Many thanks, my dearest and noblest girl, I shall now estimate my life and liberty for your sake, having a far more valu able treasure than title or fortune to rim at in7gaining possession of you, Lizzy. Br.' there is another matter which detains me also, but I fear of very little consequnces or use to me. I kept some private letters and papers about my person, which, in case I might meet with some relations hereafter, would prove my identity, for I do not be. lisve that they would recognies ms, having left home a beardless lal. These papers are, unfortunately, in Jack Tantrum's possession, and he swears that he will never give them up unless I either return to hi senrvice or leave the colonies." " Oh, never mind them, Frank, and leave this part for Heaven's sake. Your life is more precious to you and-" "Finish the sentence, mylove," whispered Anstey, quietly. "Yes and to me too, Frank," added the blushing girl, with great animation, for her lover's fate and peril appeared to conquer all her modest diffidence. Anatey, however, had too much spirit in his composition to fly at once from the place through Tantrum's threatening injunctions. Lizzy's returned love was in itself an armor against all the dangers that surrounded him. He could now brave all the vengeance which Tantrum could bring to bear against him, when in the company and confidence of his lovely Lizzy. Not discovering or overtaking their hunt-. ing companions, Arthur and Kathleen,.they shaped their course homewards. TOn LOsrE's C.T?CHISu . It will be necessary to follow the hunting couple on their galloping expedition. The ground, as Anster had remarked, was cer tainly rough and dangerous to travel over at ihe rate our;hero and his fair companion were going at. But this was not the lirst time they had put their skill in borsemanehip to such a test. They knew well the qualityanr gameness of their steedswhich took as much 

 Interest in the chase as their riders, or the dogs which followed the " flyer" so eagerly' A kangaroo chase with Scotch etaghounds is afar more speedy and perilous affair than the slow hunt of a fox and hounds, though certainly not so long. Arthur, on seeing his beloved Kathleen by his side, flying over every obstacle with ease, never gave a look behind to see how is sister-who was a more timid rider-fared. But he knew Anstey would not leave her. Many a difficult and bold leap "Kate Karney" had carried her light burden over before the "kill," which was accomplished after a hard struggle Arthur and Kathleen coming in at the death. " What a glorious run i" exclaimed Kath leen, her golden ringlets like a glistening cascade about her neck and shoulders. Her brilliant eyes sparkled like diamonds,anl her cheeks and lips glowed with the vermillion of health and pleasure. "It was a splendid run. What a game fellow that flyer was, the most wiry brute I ever followed," replied Arthur, dismounting and cutting off the game's tail as a trophy. "My gracious I what is become of the others?'" - exclaimed -Kathleen, - turning her' - panting and froth covered steed around. "Oh, never mind them. Thas Lizzy is such a coward, I suppose she got stuck up at some little creek or log, Anstey will look after her," exclaimed Anstey, carelessly. "I hope neither of them has got a fall, suggested Kathleen,' feeling rather uneasy, and a little awkward alone with Arthur for the first time since the memorable perform ance of "Romeo and Juliet." "Never fear about their falling. Lizzy is too timid to attempt a leap, and Anstey is too good a horseman," replied Arthur. " Let us hurry back and see," suggested Kathleen, getting more uneasy and confused every moment. "What a hurry you are in to get back to them. A person would imagine you were afraid of losing sight of Anstey," put -in Arthur, with some pique, still under the sus picion that the tutor was a favorite of Kath leen. "To lose sight of Anstey l Well, well. Arthur, I did not expect that from you," re plied Kathleen,while two large tears struggled for a fall in her large blue eyes. On per ceiving this Arthur repented of his cruel in sinuation and remarked: "Forgive me, Kathleen, you must know I feel very lonely ever since Anstey came.- No one to ride with me in the bush as for merly, while he has all you young ones in his company every day. Besides that I can see by your manner, Kathleen, that you do not want my company particularly when alone." This open confession and ingenuous plea wrung Kathleen's heart, while she had not courage or boldness enough to confess her real feelings towards her companion, If Arthur had owned the experience, or possessed the smallest gift of the phisiogno mist to read the language of the eyes, h e would have had no need to follow up his catechising, but poor fellow he was only a novice in love affairs. Kathleen, seeing hisï¿½total ignorance of the state oe her heart, and not wishing him to runaway with the idea shat she did not care for his company, broke through the little fortification which sbhs.d con,?rected round her secret, and replied nfter a pause: "If you fancy that I do not cere for your company, Ar:hur. you are very much mis taken. I often think of the happy days when we lode to:;ether, and would like to continue tihem, bat - I ?uppose people would say that we are ?rowing too old for that, and that it was rot very prroer for a girl like me." "Well I did n '. -hin- * that, Kathleen. Isuppoea :r 0 n . t i. .icn of :the world; still, for a ' : not be so distant to ma shaolvy. i ?- .y c: a wordwith you.

" I will answer cry questicn you will pu,, honestly and faithfully, if you answer mine afterwards." "'Tis a bargain, Arthur. Noow mind, I shall put all my questions firet, and after I have done you can commence." "Agreed on, but you must not keep on too long, for you might question on until we ar rived at home, and I would have no time to catechise you." "That is a good idea of yours ; but never fear, you shall have plenty of opportunity. Now I begin :-" "Arthur Landon are you in love ?" S"I am." "Deeply I" "Over head and ears." "Is the lady good or ordinary look. ing?" ! lost heautiful." " WVhat is the color of her hair?"* "Golden." "Her eyes?" "Blue." "Tall or short ?" "Tall." " A good or bad rider 7" "First class." " WVhat is her name?" "Kathleen Haley." The charming questidner now came to a dead stop, and blushd visibly. Arthur, in like manner, seemed:a little coneused, but wishing to have his revenge, began on his side: S'. Now, my lady, you have my secret, stand to your bargain. Kathleen Haley are you in love ?' "I am." "Deeplyd" "RMther." - "Is the gentleman good or ordinary look. ing?" "Half and between."' S"What is the color of his hair?" " Black." "His eyes?" " Ditto." " Tall or short ?" '_ Middle height.'? 

 " Good or bad rider'" " "Capital?" " ast is his name ?". At this qdestion Kathleen struck Kate Kasraey in the flank with her whip, which sent her off at full speed to overtake Anstey r end Lizzy, whom she behold some distance a'head, slowly walking their horses towards home. Arthur spurred on his horse in full ahase to overtake the fair fugitive, in order to have his last question replied to. It was an exciting race between the pair, but des pito Arthur's strenuous efforts, Kathleen kept her distance, and gained the leading couple, who wheeled around their horses on hearing 1the approaching galloping." "My Gracios sl What is the matter, r Kathleen," exclaimed Lizzy, in alarm. " Oh, it is nothing but a race between me b mo and Arthur. You are witnesses that Kste Kearney beat his flash Romeo," (a name Arthur gave his present nag.) "Don't believe her, Lizzy. It is a great I shame, she ran away to get out of a bar gain," exclaimed Arthur, with seeming vexa- I Lion. Ansfey and Lizzy exchanged a significant smile, thinking of their own little bargain, d when the former remarked: " Can you-notfinish or complete your bar- I gain now as well." " On, it is a private one," exclaimed Arthur 1 innocently. IWell, ride a-head, Lizzy, and I will walk behing," suggested Anstey. "No, nol I won't part with Lizzy any p more." exclaimed Kathleen. "Well then tell Lizzy the name of theper- t eso I asked, and Lizzy will tell me after- . wards," suggested Arthur. " I will then; but you and Mr. Anstey must ride a little in front, and must not turn your faces round until we get home," replied Kathleen, her face suffused with blushes. Then she whispered "Arthur Landon," in Lizzy's ear. According to agreement, the two young men rode in front, when Lizzy pulled up to his side, and whispered his own name in his ear, which filled him with glad ness mixed with some surprise, true to his agreement, however, he refrained from turning round to givee a thankful look to his idol, and was therefore obliged to ride out with Anstey in front, while the two happy girls gave vent at last to their long pent-up secrets, and the singular coincidence that both couples had declared their loves on the same evening. Lizzy did not reveal any of Anatey's history, however. The love part was quite sufficient for Kathleen, who told her own and Arthur's in return. We need not repeat here the happiness which filled the bosoms of the whole hunting party on that special evening, nor the soft and sly looks they exchanged on, arriving at home. Alasl they little dreamt of the dark clouds hanging in the distance which would soon envelope their new born happiness in their gloom. CHAPTER VII. MEETLNG OF OLD rTIENsU . Great changes had taken place in colonial affairs since the opening of our tale. The extraordinary discoveries of the goldfields had created sensation through all parts of the world, and thousands of enterprising speculators and miners flocked towards the scenes of such attractions. All kinds of commercial adventures flourished; and among others that of supplying demand for all kinds of stock.- -Arthur Landon, wholfol lowed cattle and horse dealing on his own account in the Victorian markets, accumu lated a fair share of the general profits ob tained in that successful trade. Jack Tan. trum was no less lucky, and was supposed to be very wealthy, but his doubtful honesty has been a bar to his successes. Our hero,on the other hand, bore Ian unimpeachable character, and he was, in consequence, far more trusted. This raised Tantrum's ire and spite against his honest and unassuming rival. Kathleen Haley's partiality to our hero was another thorn in Jack's side. He still pressed his oft rejected petitions on the charming native beauty, but her faithfulness to her lover Arthur could not be shaken by the tempting wealth and personal attractions of the clever horse-dealer, and the proprietor of the unknown "horse-shoe station." Six years had now elapsed since the first appear ance of our characters on the stage, and no alteration in the affections of the two young counles, who confessed their loves to one an. other at that memorable kangaroo hunt, had taken place. Frank Anstey was still carrying on his vocation as tutor, and, al though he received several mysterious warn ings to leave the country, could not tear him self fram the fascinating attractions of the lovely Lizzy Landon, who pressed on him the necessity of seacrifioing their mutual loves to the preservation of his own life. But Anstey was inexorable, and defied all the "horse-shoe" warnings. He often applied to Jack for his private papers, but without avail. The horse-dealertold him that he should never lay fingers on them until he had "cleared out," and landed in some other country, where Jack would forward them on receipt of tokens to that effect. Thus matters stood for the present, neither wishing to go to extremities for fear of involving him. self. It was about this time that Arthur Landon made a trip to the Melbourne market with a mob of horses and cattle. On arriving in that oity,which had of late years grown into such size and importance, he directed his steps as usual towards his former private lodgings; for, being a temperate young man, and averse to gay and noisy company, he seldom visited or put up at hotels. On enter ing the house in his rough bush garb he was shown by a servant-maid to a room where he could wash and change his garments, and, in going through his necessary ablu. tion the notes of a piano, coming from the dining apartment adjoining, struck agree ably upon his ears. Arthur, having a lfine taste for music, and living in a region where the luxury of a piano could not as yet be dreamt of, enjoyed and appreciated the more such a harmonioeus treat. Hurrying on his fitout, he quietly entered the room whence the strains proceeded lest he should inter rupt the player, and standing on the threm hold beheld at the opposite end a little girl of about twelve, in short clothes, sitting be fore a large instrument on which she played with apparent skill some beautilul and dilli. cult pieces from music before her. Never be. fore in his life seeing a female so young per forming with such finish and taste,hbo stepped softly on the carpet, until he gained a close position immediately behind her seat, while she playei without being aware of a stranger's presence. Besides the masterly execution of her performance, he could not but admire the deftness of the small fingers as, strethelifig out to their full extent, they compassed the octave. Nor did thb pure delicacy and whiteness of her transparent bare shoulders and arms, and the clustering brown locks which fell from the shapely head in natural ringlets around her neck, fail to impress a young man singularly sen sitive to such charms. At tbhe conclusion of the performance, Arthur, who had been carried away by the enchanting strains of the music, forgot that he had been a surreptitious listener, breathed out with enthusiasm: " Oh, many thanks, my dear ?" The girl gave a stars, suddenly turning round on her music stool and staring in his face with amazement. Arthur stood motion. less on looking at the large blue eyes and the parted lips, as it electrifled at that steadfast gaze,whioh he thotght resembled some other 51 

 face now haunting his memory. The little lady seemed abstracted in like manner, for her gaze was both long and piercing; but, without speaking a word, she rose in some confusion from her seat, when Arthur re marked eagerly. "Let me not disturb your musie. I am just going out." But the youthful player,. without replying, left the room, and while closing the door behind her, gave him an. other look with her magnificent blue eyes. Arthur stood in the middle of the apartment for a few seconds, thinking to himself aloud : "I am almost positive that I have seen those eyes and lips before." Then, ringing the bell, which brought the same maid-servant that he saw on entering the house, he put the following questions: "Who keeps this house now ?" "Mrs. Whitford, sir." "Indeed, I thought it was some stranger, for I always lodge here." "Yes, sir, she has only come here lately." " And is Mr. Whitford here also?" No, sir. Misses is a widow. Her husband died not long ago in the country." "Will youmplease to tell her that I would like to speak to her?" "Yes, sir, I'l tell her at once." With that the girl vanished, and presently the land lady made her appearance. Mrs. Whitford, who was robed in her mourning, was a fine lady-like and matronly person. On entering the room Arhuer in troduced himself, and the lady never hearing the name before, bowed an acklnowldge meet. "I understand Mrs. Whitford," said Arthur, "that you have not been long in this house; it is my old lodeings, and I always like to live in the same place when in town." "I have only taken these premises lately, Jr. Landon. I have always been living in the country." " So I understand. But were you living some six years back at the Upper Plenty ?" " We had a farm there, where my husband died lately, but, wishing to rend my child ren to school, I relinquished the farm on the death of my husband, and took these lodgings." 'Was that a daughter of yours, whom I saw playing on the piano as I entered ?" "No, sir. She is an adopted child, left an orphan by n friend of mine." "Oh, indeed I Were you at the Upper Plenty on Black Thursday?" "We were, moseet urioer.n~ate'.y, and were burned out. It was after this that my poor riend died through sickness caused by terror and brought on under the belief that her child - whom you saw just now - had perished in the fire on that dreadful day, while she was playing out with our neigh bours' children. But, fortunately, a bravo young bushman who had been passing that way saved the child's life at the risk of his own." " Would you know that young man again if you saw him, Mrs. Whitford?" " I doubt if I should now. He must have changed since, for he appeared very young, and, to our shame, we never inquired his name, in the confusion of the moment." "Well, I am that person, Mrs. Whitford. I thought I had seen the girl's face before, but could not bring to memory where I had seon her." "Is it really possible that you are the same. Of course, your board makes the change so marked. How glad poor Nina will be onhearing of the news. She often mentions the circumstance and its horrors, and your. kindness to her is so vividly en graved on her memory. She is one of the kindest and most afifetionate creatures that ever I met with. Her poor mother was a superior person, but, alas, unfortunate. I still remember the singular impression that your voice made on her, and how it affected her on that day." " It was most singular that her voice also struck me as very like my mother's; but such coincidences often happen I suppose, I should like to hear her history, however, if you have no objection, Mrs. Whitford." "I am sorry to say, although I had been her greatest friend in Australia that I know but little of her history, and that little is not very cheering. She never told me her maiden name, for there appeared to be some eecret about her birth or connections that she did not wish to tell. I have no doubt, however, that she must have been from a good family at home. All she told of her history was, that she was sent to a seminary for young ladies, and, when at the age of seventeen, had met with one of those refuges Italian counts, who became enamored of her beauty, and enticed her to fly with him. Not daring to return to his own country, or to face her relations, they came out here,where he found employment as teacher of music. We were living in town then, and were their neighbours, and we became very inti mate, until we took the farm at the Plenty. Hearing from some friends of his in Italy, who gave him encouragement to go home, and look after his property, which they thought he might recover, owing to a more favorable turn in the political affairs dl that edisturbed country, her husband left her and their only child in my care until his return. He expected to be back in a twelve months after; but, unfortunately, no word was ever heard from him since. Whether hehadbeen imprisoned, or lost his life, is not known. His absence and supposed death preyed so much on the poor wife's mind (she was al ways delicate) that she fell into a decline, and, the shock of Black Thursday succeed ing, she died. She implored me in her last moments to bring up and protect her only child, and expressed a vague hope that the father might be still living and claim her. I have dcne my utmost to attend to her dying reInest, and taught Nina music, and other matters the same as my own little girls, and now they attend the best ladies' school in Melbourne. 1 must say this for Nina-besides being the most obedient and warm-hearted young creature, she is the sharpest and most intelligent girl I ever met with in learning music and singing." "I have gnessed theo, Mrs. Whitford, for I watched her unobserved just now. Un. luckily she perceived me and ran away." "Never mind, Mr. Landon, you shall hear enough of her performance if you stay any time in town, I am sure she will be most happy to favor her former preserver. I will call her and introduce you." With that Mrs. Whitford rang the bell; and when the maid appeared she told her to send up Nina. The charming little lady made her appear. ance before them, when MIrs. Whitford spoke to her with motherly kindness as fol. lows: "Come here, my dear, Do you recognize this gentleman ?" "No, mamma, but I thought when I heard his voice first that it sounded like one Ihad heard before." "And you don't recognize the young gentleman ot whom you speak so often, and who saved you from the fire on Black Thursday ?" Nina made an involuntary spring towards Arthur, as if she were going to embrace him, but checking herself instantly, with her cheeks suffused with blushes, dropped her eyes with her hands extended towards the young man, who held them in his. "Go on, my dear, kiss him," suggested IMrs. Whitford. provokingly, on seeing the motion, and interpreting the meaning. Nina turned round with confusion, and buried her pretty face on her adopted mother's shoulder when Mrs. Whitferd added, smiling at Arthur:' "Don't you like to khise him now,'a~Tï¿½y did long ago," (T, be certefitted.)
