CHAPTER VII. 

 MEETING OF OLD FRIENDS. 

 Great changes had taken place in colonial affairs since the opening of our tale. The extraordinary discoveries of the goldfields had created sensation through all parts of the world, and thousands of enterprising speculators and miners flocked towards the scenes of such attractions. All kinds of commercial adventures flourished ; and among others that of supplying demand for all kinds of stock. Arthur Landon, who followed 

 cattle and horse dealing on his own account in the Victorian markets, accumulated a fair share of the general profits obtained in that successful trade. Jack Tantrum was no less lucky, and was supposed to be very wealthy, but his doubtful honesty had been a bar to his successes. Our hero, on the other hand, bore an unimpeachable character, and he was, in consequence, far more trusted. This raised Tantrum's ire and spite against his honest and unassuming rival. Kathleen Haley's partiality to our hero was another thorn in Jack's side. He still pressed his oft rejected petitions on the charming native beauty, but her faithfulness to her lover Arthur could not be shaken by the tempting wealth and personal attractions of the clever horse-dealer, and the proprietor of the unknown " horse-shoe station." Six years had now elapsed since the first appearance of our characters on the stage, and no 

 alteration in the affections of the two young couples, who confessed their loves to one another at that memorable kangaroo hunt, had taken place. Frank Anstey was still carrying on his vocation as tutor, and, although he received several mysterious warnings to leave the country, could not tear himself from the fascinating attractions of the lovely Lizzy Landon, who pressed on him the necessity of sacrificing their mutual loves to the preservation of his own life. But Anstey was inexorable, and defied all the "horse-shoe" warnings. He often applied to Jack for his private papers, but without avail. The horse-dealer told him that he should never lay fingers on them until he had " cleared out," and landed in some other country, where Jack would forward them on receipt of tokens to that effect. Thus matters stood for the present, neither wishing to go to extremities for fear of involving himself.

 It waa about this time that Arthur Landon .Bade a trip to the Melbourne market with a mob ot horses and cattle. On arriving in that city .which had of late years grown into sach size end importance, he directed his steps as usual 'towards his former private lodgings ; for, being a temperate yoong man, and averse to gay and noisy company, he seldom visited or put up at hotels. On enter* ing the house in his rough bush garb be was shown by a servant-maid to a room where be could wash and change his garments, and, in going through his necessary ablu- tion the notes of a piano, coming from the dining apartment adjoining, struck agree- ably upon bis ears. Arthur, having a �fine taste for music, and living in a region where 

 the luxury of a piano could not aa yet oe dreamt of, enjoyed and appreciated the more ?nota a harmonious treat. Hurrying on his fit out, he quietly entered the room whence the strains proceeded lest he should inter* rapt the player, and standing on the thres- hold beheld at the opposite end a little girl of about twelve, in short clothes, sitting be- fore a large instrument on which she played with apparent skill some beautiful and diffi- cult pieces from music before her. Never be- fore in his life seeing a female so young per- forming with such finish and taste.he stepped softly on the carpet, until he gained a close position immediately behind her seat, while she played without being aware of a stranger's presence. Besides the masterly execution of her performance, he could not but admire the deftness of tha small fingers as, stretching out to their full extent, they compassed the octave. Nor did the pure delicacy and whiteness of her transparent bare shoulders and arras, and the clustering brown looks which fell from the shapely head in natural ringlets around her neck, fail to impress a yoong man singularly sen- 

 sitive to such charms. 

 At the conclusion of the performance, Arthur, who had been carried away by the enchanting strains of the music, forgot that he had been a surreptitious listener, breathed 

 out with enthusiasm: 

 " Ob, many thanks, my dear ?" 

 The girl gave a start, suddenly taming round on her music stool and staring in his face with amazement. Arthur stood motion* less on looking at the large blue eyes and the parted lips, aa if electrified at that steadfast gaze,wbieb be thought resembled some other 

 51 

 face now haunting his memory. The little Judy seemed abstracted in like manner, for ber gaze was both long and piercing; but, ?without speaking a word, she rose in some confusion from hor ecat, when Arthur re- marked eagerly. 

 *' Let me not disturb your music. I am just going out." But the youthful player, without replying, left the room, and. while closing the door behind her. gave him an-' other look with her magnificent blue eyes. Arthur stood ia the middle of the apartment for a few seconds, thinking to himself 

 aloud : 

 "lam almost positive that I have seen those ejes and lips before," Then, ringing the bell, which brought the same roaid-Ecrvant that ho saw on entering the house, he put the following questions : 

 " Who keeps this house now ?*' " Mrs. Whitford, sir." 

 " Indeed, I thought it was some stranger, for I always lodge here." 

 "Yes, sir, she has only come hera latsly." 

 " And ia Mr. Whitford here also ?" 

 No, sir. Missus is a widow. Her husband died not long ago in tba country." 

 "Will yon please to tell her that I would lika to speak to her?** 

 " Yes, sir, I'll tell her at once." With that the girl vanished, and presently the land- lady made her appearance. 

 Mrs. Whitford, who was robed in her mourning, waa a fine lady-like and matronly person. On entering the room Arthur in- troduced himself, and the lady never hearing the name before, bowed an acknowledge 

 meet. 

 "I ande-stand Mn. Whitford," said Arthur, "that you have not been long in thia house ; it is my old lodgings, and I always like to live in the same place when in town." 

 .' I bave only taken these premises lately, Mr. Landor. I have always been living in the country." 

 " So I understand. Bat were yon living some sis years back at the Upper Plenty ?" 

 " We had a farm there, where ruy husband ? died lately, but, malling to send my child- ren to school, I relinquished the farm on the death of my husband, sud took these lodgings." 

 " Wss that a daughter o! yours, whom I saw playing on the piano as I entered ?" 

 " No, sir. She is an adopted child, left aa orphan by a friend of mine." 

 "Oh,indeed 1 Were you at tteJUpper Plenty on Black Thursday 7'* 

 �' We were, most uplo'tucstely, and wera burned out. It wis after this that ny poor rriend died through sickness caused by terror and brought on under tho belief that her ehild - whom yon saw just now - had perished in the fire on that dreadful day, while she wa� playing oat with oar neigh- bours' children. Bat, fortunately, a brave yoong bushman who had been passing that, way saved the child's life at the risk ot: his 

 own." 

 " Would you know that young suva again if yon saw him. Mts. Whitford?". 

 " I doubt if I should now. He must have changed since, for he appeared very young, and, to our shame, we never inquired hie name, in the confusion of the moment." - 

 "Well, I am that person, Mrs. Whitford. I thought I had seen the girl's face before, but could not bring to memory where I had 

 .sen her." 

 "Is it really possible that yon are the same. 1 Of course, your beard makes the change so marked. How glad poor Nina will be on hearing of the news. She often mentions the circumstance and ita horrors, and your kindness to her is so vividly en graved On her memory.- Sha is one ot tho kindest and moat affectionate creatures that ever I met with. Her poor mother was a superior person, bat, alas, unfortunate. I still remember the singular impression that your voice made on her, and how it affected her on that day." 

 " It was most singular that her voice abo straok ms as very like my mother's; but such coincidences often happen I suppose. I should like to hear her history, however, if yon have no objection, Mrs. Whitford." 

 "I am sorry to say, although I had been her greatest friend in Australia that I know bat little of her history, end that little is not very cheering. She never told me her maiden name, for there appeared to ba some secret about her birth or connections that she did not wish to tell. I have no doubt, however, that Bhe must have been from a good family at home. AU she told of her history was, 

 that she was sent to a seminary for youajaj. ladies, and, when at the age of seventeetH, had met with one of those refugee Italien counts, who became enamored of her beauty, and enticed ber to fly with him. Not darusg to return to his own country, or to face bar relations, they came out here.wherehe focad employment as teacher of music We were living in town then, and were tbser neighbours, and we became very inti- mate, until we took the farm at the Plenty.

He expected to ba back in a twelve montbe after ; but, unfortunately, no word waa ever heard from him since. Whether he had been imprisoned, or lost his life, is not known. His absence and supposed death preyed so much on the poor wife's mind (she was al* ways delicate) that she fell into a decline, and, the shock of Black Thursday succeed- ing, she died. She implored me in her last moments to bring up and protect her only child, and expressed a vague hope that the father might be still living and claim her. I have dene my utmost to attend to ber dying request, and taught Nina music, and other matters the same as my own little girls, and now they attend the best ladies' school in Melbourne. I inuBt say this for Nina-besides being the most obedient and warm-hearted young creature, she is the sharpest and most intelligent girl I ever met with in learning music and singing. "</het<> 

 " I have guessed that, Mrs. Whitford, for I watched her unobserved just now. Un- luckily ehe perceived me and ran away." 

 " Never mind, Mr. Landon, you shall hear enough of her performance if you Etay any time in town, I am sure she will be most happy to favor her former preserver. I will call ber and introduce you." 

 With that Mrs. Whitford rang the bell; and when the maid appeared ehe told her to send up Nina. 

 The charming little lady made her appear, ance before them, when Mrs. Whitford spoke to her with motherly kindness as fol- 

 lows : 

 " Come here, my dear. Do yon recognize 

 this gentleman ?" 

 " No, mamma, but I thought when I heard 

 his voice first that it eounded like one Ihad~ heard b?fore." , i 

 "And you don't recognize the 

 gentleman of whom you speak so often, saki ; 

 who saved you from the fire on Black Thursday?" 

 Nina made an involuntary spring towline , Arthur, as if she were going to embrace him, but checking herself instantly, with bee cheeks suffused with. blushes, dropped bet eyes with her hands extended towards the yoong man, who held them ia hie. 

 "Go on, my dear, Joss ram,*' mggttUi 

 Mrs.Whitford, provokingly,,OB seeing the* motion, and interpreting the meaning. Niau turned round with confusion, and buried her pretty face on her adopted moaasra shoulder when Mrs. Whitford added, tmUag at Arthur: 

 "Don't you like to kiss him BOW, af fian i did long ago."
