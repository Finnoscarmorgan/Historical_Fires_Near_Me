CHAPTER X* 

 tUTHUEElf LETS TBK CAT OUT OF TBS BAS.' 

 Oar hero's epistolary account of his ad- rentares in the capital of Victoria may seem i ridienloas to some ot oar more experienced 

 readers, nevertheless it vin show the sim- plicity and harmless character of those in- habiting and passing a life of quietness and unobtrusiveness among the more sequestered parts of our extensive continent. The con- tents of the letter, though simple in them- selves, were eagerly perused and appreciated by those whom the writer intended to amuse and please, save one, and that one was the last he would wish to annoy. 

 Kathleen Haley, whom Lizzy visited im- mediately on receipt of the letter (for then j were now too old to attend school) peruse�? 

 the welcome news, bat, to Lizzy's disappoint ment and surprise, her fair neighbor mani- fested no pleasure, nor did she share in the general delight which the other members ot both families expressed at the advent ot the epistle os the expected arrival ot tho 

 writer. 

 Lizzy did not stay long on per ceiling the dejected looks of Kathleen, and returned home forwith ; but aa soon as the sound ot hes horse's steps died away on the breeze, Kathleen rushed to her room,where she gave vent to ber sobs and a flood of tears. Her kind mother, perceiving the movement and hearing her daughter's weeping, became both surprised and alarmed, and flew to ber, exclaiming: 

 *' Kithleen.mavaurneen, what ia the nam�, i of goodness aus you ?" 

 " Ob, mother dear. I cannot hide it any I longer 1 It is about Arthur." 

 " Arthur, my honey 1 �hat of him ? Isn't be right well ? Didn't yon see by his letter� child, that he bought all the Ulinga and ia wining soon?'' 

 " I don't care for tba things, mother. Ti's 

 himself." 

 " My gracious, child ! what do you mean? Keep quiet a moment. There now-dry your tears and lean on my shoulder. Wouldn't you tell your own darling mother 

 �hat ia the matter?" 

 *'�a, mot&er dear, you �roo t bs angry with me ?" 

 " Angry at yon, mavourneen ? Why ahoald I be angry at you child, that nerer did any hann ?n your life ?" 

 "Ie it harm to love another more than yon and my lather, and not teliiog it for rix yean?" 

 � My poor innocent chili, ii fiat the �nee ot your grief? I understand now, my hooey. Toa love Arthur then? Tue thing uever struck me to this moment. Don't frat your. ] self any more. That's but a fault which i every boy and girl commits in their : time, and which your poor mother com* j mitted beton you." 

 ! "And yon forgive me, mother dear?" 

 j "Forgiveyou, honey? There's nothing . to forgive. Don't yon know it's natural for : boys and girls to love one another, other, j wise then would be no marriages ? And j you say that you have loved Arthur for six ' yean? Do yon think he loves yon in re 

 torn?" 

 He told me so once, but yon eec by hie letter that he loves that little girl in Mel- bourne, whom he calls Nina, and whom be saved on Black Thursday when ehe waa a child, if you remember." 

 "Hoo 1 �tile murder, the eat is ont of the bag at last! Why, yon little goose, she is only a child still. The boy ia only treating ber aa a plaything. Ton need not be in tba feast alarmed, my child. That little girl, yon new, ia hardly thirteen yet." ? 

 " I waa only thirteen myself, wnen I first cania to know that I loved him, and when 

 i be-" 

 I "Whenhewhat,myhoawy? What did bc ioor 

 i " He kissed me 1 Wu ibera harm in it ?" 

 � whitpered Kathleen,T great coniasion.mixed I with teer. 

 j "God bleu the innocent child ! many a j iou the boye atole from me bet�re I wu i married to your father, ead thought nothing . of it a moment attar. It wu the fashion ia 

 ! oar place." 

 j "Dewma! Do jw ny M mother! I 

 j never wu trimed bot that time, and j then Arthur did not do it intentionally, be ! wu only acting what he MW in the theatre m Melbourne/ But ie it not strange thu I ? should narar forget it. and from that auna ; moment I loved him?" 

 "Mow tell met thia, mavourneen: amen ! did be My that be loved you. or how did it I come about?" 

 " Oh it wu ona day we were ont hunting kangaroos with lizzy and Anstey, who could not keep np with Arthur and me. I think Arthat wu teasing me aboat Anstey, and angry that I did not go oat with him ai j usual to ride. We then mada an agreement ! to answer all.the questions which the othes ' put, and when I asked him whether he wu ' in love, and tba cleecription of bis sweetheart '? which exactly corresponded with my own ; image, end at last I asked her naasff.whm ha 

 gave my own." 

 i " Well, that wu a tunny way too. Troth, > that's nos the wey they courted me in I Ireland. They weald tall me plump and I plain that they wara dying tot me, and praise ! my beauty up to the eries. But I suppose ' they do it differently in Aastralia. Did he i aay anything aboat renrriage to yon attn ! that?" 

 " Net�, TM tn bot* too Hy to mention i anything that way.". 

 "Wau, my lora, I don't know �hat exactly to MJ. That Jack Tantrum ia ! bothering your father and ma about you. j He ii constantly asking TM for to Riv� yon ia I marriage to biro, and although ve know he j ia rery rich ana darer ana earthen thuga; 

 still, we dont like him for a husband for 

 j you, my dear. If wa thought that Artbat ; meant to ask yon some time, he would befar j mon preferable. Still, he may not think of > marriage at all, and it would ba a pity to ! lona good offer like Jack." 

 j "Oh, mother, I would natur eonsent to 

 many Tack Tantrum-I hate bim. But if ! I aaa Arthur ia in lose with that little Nina, 1 and if he means to take her here to teach na [ music, aa he proposes, sooner than aaa hat ; his wife, I would accept Tantrum." 

 i " I don't believe Arthur lotes the girl in i that way ; ' however, well wait and see. i You ara young enough yet to speak of these j things.'1 

 Our hero little suspected the mischief hie i unconscious praise of Nina had created in i the pun heart of bia adorable Kathleen, 

 whom ba intended to benefit by Nina's in- structions in mu�e, as well as bis own sisters. 

 On bis arrival at home, he was ntber dis- appointed at Kathleen's cool reception of him, although all the o then seemed to hail bia return with more joy than formerly, owing to the his long absence. And etan when the many gifts and costly female Car- men ts arited by the dray from Twofold Bay, with the piano induded, her distance and apparent indifference to bia oompany re- ceived no change. He could not comprehend the resson,altbongh he continually taxed his mind to discover the cause, and, at length came to the conclusion that either Anstey ot Jack Tantrum moat be at the bottom of it, for be knew no other likely rival woe could I .� eat him out.", 

 T i ' niano and moaie were pat into re qa'. - .a in doe time, when th� yoaiig ladies, and r th� tuition af Anstey-who was an ex* sellent player-and Mrs. Landon-who soon revived her piofieieney in that aeoompliah* ment-soon became passable players, while the younger members of both familias prac- tised regularly also. 

 The time passed thus pleasantly along,unt� Arthur's next trip to make with his stock drew nigh, when Kathleen became every day more low-spirited and distant towards him. Still, he eould not imagine the cause ot thia singu- lar estrangement. The day before bis de- parture, when taking leave of Haley's family, he obtained an opportunity to saw a few words to her privately, when the following conversation took place : 

 "I am glad to have thia opportunity te talk to yon alone. Kathleen, before I leave. Tour late coolness towards ma baa basa a cause ot great anxiety and surprise to 

 me.'* 

 "I supposa that yon don't oars reach, now that you are to visit Melbourne and ese your 

 friends there who ere nicer end more ac* I 

 eomplished than we poor bush girls." 

 " I don't understand what yon mean by 

 my ' Melbourn� friends,' Kathleen, for I have very few there. But I am sorry that I have lost your favor so much lately. If I have done anything that has displeased yon, it must have been done uruntcntionally, and X would like that you should lat me now of it" 

 Kathleen had a good share ot spirit in ber. She would sooner suffer the moat acute 

 pain and dissppointment than let Arthur perceive that she was jealous of the aeoom* pushed and favorite Nina-as she thought and she therefore replied and behaved with 

 more indifference than her heart dictated. She also knew by his words and looks that he entertained some suspicions that some other rival had stepped in when he wu away so long on the former trip. Not wishing to convince him of the contrary, and u a est off to bis own faithlessness, she said : 

 "People change their minds at timas, it 

 seems." 

 Whatever eh� ehe intended to uy could not fled utterance, tot a choking sensation seized her at the moment, when Arthur with . melancholy look and expression re- plied : 

 " Ob, it that is the ease it explains the matter. But X didn't think thu yon were one of thou people. Kathleen,'' and, without waiting for an answer, be spurred his horse-upon which he had 'been Bitting during the eonversation - and galloped away in a state ot mind not to ba envied. 

 Poor Kathleen stood transfixed on the spot, gasping for breath, and staring siter him ontil he had passed from her sight. 

 Her eoneeience smote her for the unfor- tunate expression which she had made, and which had a contrary elfect on her lover to that intended. On re-entering the boase she took refago in her room, in oider to evade the looks of the family, and give vent to her straggling tears. Tue sharp and anxious gaze of her affectionate mother detected her grief. She soon followed ber to console as usual, enquiring in persuasive and kind ac- 

 cents. 

 ..What has disturbed raj darling Kath- leen? Another love quarrel, I suppose. Open your heart, mavourneen, to your own 

 mother." 

 ".Oh, mother dear, be left me in anger ! It ia ail over now and for ever," exclaimed the disconsolate Kathleen, in great grief. 

 " Have coorara, my honey. Yon maj ba mistaken. Whose fault was it, mj 

 child?" 

 u Oh, that ie the worst part of it 1 It waa all my own, and I drove him away ander the impression that I had changed m j 

 mind." 

 " How did yon do thal, Kathleen ? Lat mo 

 baaz it." 

 H Ton aaa, easther, I haTfl bean cooler to him aiiioe he esme beek from Melbourne last trip, through being annoyed abont that Nina be thinks so muon of. I understood by hie words to-day that he imagined I liked some other person better than himself, and, jost throngh a foolish spite, I did not nn deceive him. And so he has gone off in a hoff, ander that impression. I would give the world, if I had it, to recall my words now, bat it ia too late ; he'll meet that girl again who ia now grown np and ia so accomplished,!- sop. pose.*' 

 " Make yourself easy my ohQd. If Provi- dence KM it ia proper that yon should be man and wife, Hell bring it round in time.'' 

 After thews pioos and maternal consolations, Kathleen became mora reconciled to her fate, and, by degrees, gained her equanimity. 

 Not so her dejected lover. He had no one to j 

 eonsolshhn on bia journey to the distant market, or to cheer his disconsolate thoughts oaring his long night watsbes while eanrping with his stock. Many a weary hoar he passed in no better company than his own aaa thoughts and regntfnl roemory. Some tiona he would come to the resolution to dnve her from his memory altogether, and turn his thoughts to thc sprightly Nina, who most be now grown op a little, and as old as lawnton WM when he first became enamorad with her. These hopeful consolations were occasionally applied to his chaappointed mind aa a balm to his wounded feelings ; but, alas, 

 they wm soon e^spelled, ai will be seen in 

 the nest chapter.
