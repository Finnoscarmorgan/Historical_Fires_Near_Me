CHAPTER IX. 

 ABTHUB'S XiKTTEX IO UH�Xt 

 It may asem amnung and even ridiculous to eome of oar gentlemen bnalunen of the present dar, when they eome to know all tba little commissions that were entrusted to and executed by oar nero on his annual tripe to Mel bourne. Bat when they eon sider the outlandish situation of the families ia Maneroo, and that none of the female por- tion of them could conveniently visit towna to observe the fashions, they will cease to wonder that Arthur, a good-natured fellow and a dutiful son, took upon himself to supply his sister Lizxy and Kathleen with all articles of female dress they required. So far as he was able to observe while in town, ba carried back the fashions of tho times that they might imitate them in the bush. Thia part of his commission ont hero found rather difficult and even delicate to perform, aa win be seen in his tetter to bis sister.wbich wa take the liberty of inserting in order to give the reader a better idea ot the writer's task. It must also be observed that he had to purchase all the necessary supplies and fit oat for both families, sufficient to last daring 

 the following twelve months, which he had to ship by v�asele calling at Twofold Bay on their passage to Sydney. 

 On thia occasion, ha stayed in Melbourne longer than usual, being delayed by driving bia horses to some of the goldfields in order to get a batter aale tor them. 

 The otes m re he enjoyed at Mrs.Whitford's with Nina's charming company and music waa another attraction to delay him on thia ocession. The little girl coaxed bim from day to day to datar bia departure. He, how- ever, dispatched his drivers home to toe station whenever the stock had been dis- 

 posed of, sending the above men turned epistle to hie sister, which tua aa fol

 " I suppose yoa thought mt lott, I haring baca from home rn long thia trip, bot the men-by whom I forward thia-will < tall yon the MUM of my delay. I may be j detained for a abort time in Melboona yet getting auppliaa and shipping them to Two-' fold Bay. Ton cannot guess whom I met in town, and who lires in the tame house with me now? You remember the little girl whom I eared on Black Thursday. Imagine,then,my aurpriss on meeting her here, and grown np a fina little lady, quite accomplished, and, � abara aO, the most charming singer and player on the piano that ever I heard. Toa would not beber� how fond she ia of me, I and I most say that I am the same towards j her. I cannot maka out tba interest I hare 

 taken in ber, aa if abe were related to me. 

 II wish yon had saan her, I am sure yon ! I would ba the same. Ton know already how 

 passionately fond ot music I am. Nina, I knowing thc same, plays and sings to me I Ska a nightingale to my heart's oontent I 

 often play my flats (a nice pocket ona I bought thia tima) which pleases her very ranch. She saya that I play tho notes to pei tat lion. Sba ia a wonderful judge of maoic for her age, which ia between twelve and thirteen She is so sharp and old. ntabioned also, although, ot course, she com. mits gome **iM�tJ� Hif-tiYrr at times. Toa wonld htngh.T know.to ase berat times when taaoad by a yoong gentleman that lodges bara, and who trias to kisa bat at every op- portunity, and, io order to escape him, she fine to me for protection, springs on my knee, throws her arms round my neck, and buries har face in my bosom, begging me to 

 "AD id� hu eome into my head which I think would be an excellent plan, and which iitbie: Il I could coax Mr�. Whitford-with whom Nina Urea-to allow the little lady to eome over to our elation to teach jon young gide to play the piano. I have bought 

 . nice instrument which I send with the 

 other things, for it is a great pity that yon never had an opportunity of learning such a nceeesary accomplishment. Our mother has been a fine player, I believe, but I fear 

 she has forgotten the art. Anstey also plays remarkably well-for I heard him when Ien gaged him in Melbourne-and might give yon lessons; but if Nina could be prevailed upon it would be far better. I have spoken to Mrs. Whitford on the subject, but site thinks it a pity to deprivs Nina of ber schooling, to which she attends every day, along with her own daughters. But in a year or two she would not object. We will consider the matter when I go home. 

 "I bought a whola 'swag' of things dresses, riding-habits, saddles, bridles, and other 'thmg-a-majiga' for yon and Kathleen. I had a fine judge this trip in Mrs. Whitford, who kindly volunteered to pick all thcea articles according to the present fashion, but I wu too shy to ask about the make,and how things were worn-u you wished me to as- 

 certain-for-1 was afraid she would make 

 fun of a man making such enquiries. I had therefore to take a note u usual, myself, when walking in the town, by looking at the fashionable ladies' dresses; but, unfortu- nately, I fell into a scrape or mistake through my inspection, and never shall attempt it 

 aaain. 

 "I told Mrs. Whitford of the cireamatance, ?nd the laughed heartily, saying that the ladies in question were not 'proper char- acters.' So yon see a bushman ia ignorant of many customs in town, and must mind what be ie about. 

 "Another time, I fell into a mistake when accompanying Mrs. Whitford, while pnr ; chasing things for yon in one of the grand 

 haberdasher's shops. It was in the evening, and while Mrs. Whitford waa inspecting and ; pricing some dresses at one of the long i co an ten which stand on each side the whole ! length of tba shop, I noticed several ladies 

 Bitting in chairs, bargaining also ; but there were three or tour ladies with their backe turned towards roe, and standing in the j same position motionless. Although the 

 other eojtomcw wore going and awning, I 

 notified that these ladies never mared, and | thonght to myself that they wera stationed, there as watch on the customers. Perceiving that they were very neat about the waist and ' nicely dressed, I resolved to have a peep at their facas, and, accordingly, stepped across to the counter and purchased a pocket-hand* kerchief as au excuse. While the shop-man waa spreading before me some samples, I turned round in order to have a view of the stiff lady near me, when to my utmost sur- prise and annoyance I could not see a face at all. The shopman suspected my mistake and laughed heartily, telling me these were only figures to set off the dresses for aa example. But the greatest blunder of all waa made by me at the Wax-works, which also took place in the night time. I had often beard about this exhibition of art, but never visited it until thia time. On being directed to the place, and paying my en- trance fee, I was shown into a large hall where a number of spec ta to ra were inspecting a whole host of wax-figures, ranged on each side, with tickets on them specifying their names. I got a catalogue also, in which the figures were described, and which told the names of each. Among tbs spectators, I be- held a man dressed in a gold-digger's clothes with blue serge shirt, glazed belt, felt hat,and cord breeches, with a catalogue in his hand, and his gaze fixed on one of the figures before 

 i tum. 

 " I could not find tho figaro io 017 cate 

 logue, nor could I ase a ticket on the wax- j figure to describe it. I thaefore asked the ; gold-digger whether he knev whom the figure 1 

 represented. Not replying to my question, j and thinking he most be jard of hearing, j Ixepestedmy inquiry io a loader tone, bat ' the digger never moved or replied, and, to 1 my annoyance, I heard a�rerai yoong lady � 

 spectators giggling beside me. I at ones 

 found oat my mistake, and that the would- ! be digger was bat a wax-igure itself. I ! now strolled towards the other end of tba [ hall, determined not to ba taken in again. i 

 "After examining many life-like figures of j notable characters, I beheld one sitting in a ; chair on the floor of the kail, which I ] thought quite as lite-like aa the digger, I j could see 00 ticket on this one either, and ? inspecting it closely with my eyes, and look- ,:; ing attentively on both sides of ia face to sss 

 more minutely the well executed figure, to ; my surprise it tamed toward* me at onee ' exclaiming : " j 

 ".Don't bite a fellow.' � "I sprang back immediately, when my ! would be wax-figure walked awaj. He ap- peared to be ooo of the. keepera a watchers who look to it that nono of tnt spectator! 

 toueh any of the figures in tie exhib�' ? tion. j 

 "Another novelty which attraea great at- j tention on Saturday nights in Mslbonrna ia ' the Eastern llarket, which I waited, and : where I committed another blonder, owing I to my ignorance of town scene�. On ap- . proaching the pit�, my otra trace itonned . by all sorts of eries and voices, at if iasuing > from Bedlam. 1 

 " Innumerable stalls or tablet covered with all the goode era mannfaarared in ereation, and whose Tendon appealed to be eiezed with % sadden fit of insanity, each screeching oat the name of his cheap ware, and aa if to drown bis neighbor's voice, while bibiting some article to all the passers-by. This, with the quacking of docks, gobbling of geese, and cackling of fowls, created such an infernal noise aa made my head dizzy. I waa. nally �y�Ma to collect my sen sea properly, while brambled stupidly through this scene of confusion, stumbling <rrary �Up against a stand, or some other wandering 

 spectator like myself. The strange refleo- ; Kons east by the torches or other lights \\ which illuminated thia nocturnal fair, made j the scene more singular to the beholder, j Through my perambulating inspection, I \\ aw attracted by some ingenious specimens j of sweets or lollies formed into large shaprS ! of walking sticks, animals, and calves beads, ! ftc By the aide of these, I beheld one of ah j old woman dressed np (as I thought) sitting ; on a bench beside the others. The strange ' glare of light reflected on the pale visage and j closed, sunken eye� with -insular effect. This , masterly piece of IoHy-niaking filled me with , wonder, and in my excited state I caught the j would be figure's sharp and prominent nose, in order to break it off and keep it as a speci- 

 men, when to my horror the figure roared ; out'murder.' j 

 "I bounded through the crowd in terror, � knocking down several in my headlong way, � until I gained the middle of the street, and rapidly steered my way to my lodgings. It appears'? that my supposed figure or 'lolly' was the vendor of the other sweets, exhibited on the stall before her, and that the poor old creature had fallen off to sleep, may be worn out with watching and fatigue. 

 " I have drawn oat this letter longer than I anticipated, and aban therefore bring it to a close, and give yon all a more elaborate de- tail of the wonders ot Melbourne when I get home. TeD father to start the dny at once on receipt of thia for Twofold Bay for the loading, and let the bullock-driver be very careful of the piano ease and other articles while loading and unloading. 

 "With kind love to all the .family and Haley's people (not forgetting Kathleen), 

 "I remain,
