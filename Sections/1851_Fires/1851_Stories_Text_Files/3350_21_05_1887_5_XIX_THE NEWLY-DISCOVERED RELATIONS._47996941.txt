 "For shame, Arthur-kiasing a married 

 woman!" 

 Ha atood aghast, traaafixed to the spot.not kaowiag how to exprese himself, and perceiv- ing, far tho first time, Mrs. Whitford, who oin teemed displeased which added mon to hm eonfaiion. At last ha found otter 

 "Toa an aotmazried santy, 9iaa? Yea) OsdyJoka,n- ba erial. 

 ". Than iaao jaka about it, Arthur, Mrs. Whitford wal tell you," replied Nina, with a trarabinig voies. 

 Mrs. Whitford confirmed the statement, tad Arthox fay degrees gained hil equani- 

 mity. 

 Wa will give Nina's history ia our owa word*, but, at tba same time curtail it, aa aome of the details would ba superfluous and naiiitorssting to the reader. 

 Wa bava aeon already that the count-her father-had been liberated in his native mqrttwy, mhm� hm hmA lin imytrjmnnmA MM Sn for political offences. He had been 

 ta babirra that bia property-which had baan oonfaratad-would be restored to him ; bot, unfortunately, while away io Australia foe bia daughter Nina, another political dis t�rbanos took plana before he returned, which Ha tauted bi� laying chum to the property, aa that ha waa obliged to wait bia time until . mon favorable occasion presented itself. AH �bia raaourcas wen whanstcd, and, not being able to �am a living for himself and daughter, bo at length came to thercnolntion of taking advantage af Nina's natani gifts by instructing her (through the interest of aome of Ina friends) ia singing. She waa accordingly �eat to the best aad most cele, hrated school io Italy. Nina's natani gifts .od abQitiee �ooo enabled her' to raak amongst tba moat talented vocalists in Italy, aad being poeeeased of ran personal attractions oom Bined with the other qualin cations, hex futon sueceas upon tba stage waa ponai dared a certainty. Bat her poor father did not lin long to enjoy bia daughter's triompha, for hi� long imprisonment aad re versea bad undermined a constitution which bad aster baan robust. On hi� death he left Nina aome documents which contained his own hjatory and that of her mother, so far aa ba knew. 

 Aa to bia own history, it wu only a rope, tition of the life and adveaturea of many other raf agaa from bis country, and there fanaot worth recording here. Bot his late wife's, aUaoogh abort, �hu ba non nattai 00 OK Ma. fjbabadbiaoBaeoIydaaghtai 

 of a younger scion of sn aristocratic family in England, �ho hal married a beautiful girl of hambler class in society. Conse- quently bis relations woold not recognize him. Bat at his death (after his wife had given birth to a daughter, the subject of this memoir) the great family adapted the child, who if she lived would some day become a great b&iress. . The child became a great favorite.as there were no other yoong shoots among the branches ot the family, and aa may be supposed abe had a good deal of her own way.* Among all the other branches cf edaoation and accomplishments she had been taught, it had been arrancad that sha should enjoy the benefit of a first class Italian tutor, to teach her music. The refugee Count-who waa one ot the talented teachers to be found inEngland-was engaged for that serrioe. The consequence may be guessed. The yoong pupil fell in lore with the hand � some Italian, who returned her affection, and the misgnidad pair eloped and came to Melbourne, where-as we have heard before -they had to depsnd for living on tua Count's musical talents. 

 ** Bat do you know your mother's maiden name, or is her mother (jaar grandmother) living?" asked our hero, excitedly inter rap ting Nins in the midst of her his- 

 tory. 

 " Indeed, I forget the nama just now, but I shall see by the papers when I look through them. They are somewhere in one of my trunks. But as for your other question "what became of my grandmother?" the papers recoil that sha married a formet lover of hex's and esme to Australia." 

 Thia addition made Arthur manifest more interest still in the narrative, bat be allowed Rina to finish her own history,which she seemed to approach with more timidity and 

 feeling, and which waa to the following ef 

 featf 

 Although aha eonld easily fiad abondant engagements ander. celebrated managers to join theatrical or opera companies in Europe after her father's death, she preferred coming to Australia. She therefore joined the com- pany abe �aa then with on their taking en- gagements for a toar in the colonies. On her first appearance in Melbourne, Pembroke recognized and fell desperately io love with her after their old acquaintanceship, and being a handsome young gentleman and re- puted a elevar and well to do person, abe rs� Mired his addresses, but never yielded to his earnest proffers of marriage na til he told her that Arthur Landon-whom she eagerly wished to see-had lain for aome time under a terrible charge of murdering a beautiful j girl whom he loved in a fit of jealousy. Mrs. 

 Whitford had corroborated this statement < by telling her hov Arthur had been arrested 

 at her house on the above charge. 

 i . Under these circumstances, and on tba i morning of that same day, Pembroke suc- 

 ceeded in prevailing upon her to become bia ��fe, and the marriage waa celebrated pri- . vitaJy at lira. Whitfords Bot, alas I tba most du tressing part of tba history was to 

 follow. 

 Tbs young gentleman who tetad aa bast man, and who was one of the clerks belong- ing to the bank in which the bridegroom �as employed, returned in a few hours with the dreadful intelligence thai theta had been an examination made of Pembroke's books and that defalcations to a considerable amount had been discovered. Tba conse qoencs was that a warrant waa issued by tba 

 bank directo� against him. 

 Ha thought in the first instance to give himself up, but the clerk advised him strongly to ship himself o3 to South America, which last advice he followed. Io bidding farewell 

 to his unfortunate bride, I� btggtd ol W io - 

 keep the marriage a secret, and urged tba other parties that were witnesses to the sama effect, which they all promised. Ha also left a good sum of money with Nina, and told bet o make a trip to California that ha might 

 oin her there. 

 She now, with streaming tearsJaidher sad tale before oar hero, whom aha eonaidered aa her truest and best friend on earth. She told bim, also, with ardent resolution that abe woold hand over every farthing her mis- guided husband left her, and that she would moreover follow out her profession with all bar zeal in order to save out of ber earnings sufficient to liquidate his d�falcations bj yearly instalments. 

 Never before did tba noble-minded girl stand so ugh in the estimation of our hero as on tba present occasion, when thus offer* �ug to nisia such a sacrifice. He never told her that he waa himself a sufferer by her hus- band's frauds, lest the knowledge should in- crease ber distress. 

 Ha did not wonder at har break dova while singing that evening, and rather mar Tailed that abe bad held ont BO long. Har ease he considered harder than his own, every syllable of which ha related to the weeping Nina, who sympathised with him in full pity. She now lamented the roora that Arthur had not arrived a day aooner.de clariog that she never would have become Penbroke's wife-even if be wera innocent bad our hero made an offer fox hex hand. But, alas 1 these declarations wara now too late, and lamentations wara all owavafl inc. 

 Arthur was the first to rouse himself from these desponding thoughts, by asking Nina to look at the documents in which the maiden name of her late mother waa mentioned, aa the subject seemed to take some special hold of his thoughts. Nina excused herself for for. getting a subject so closely connected with her own parentage, by remarking that she never heard hex father mention the name, and she was too yoong when her mother died to put the question, and although she read the name once, it 'had escaped her memory, having never beard the same be- fore. She now searched diligently for hex parents' marriage certificate, and read ont in dear accents-which thrilled every vein in Arthur Landon's heart - the following 

 words: 

 "The only daughter of tba last Hon, 

 Charles James Cranstone." 

 M Good Heavens-I thought so �"exclaimed Arthur, springing up to his feet, and en- circling Nina in his arms for the second tims that evening. " My darling Neice I Ton ara not offended with your uncle, Nina. The Hon. Charles Cranstone wss my mother's first husband, and they had but one child, your mother. 'I now remember her voice on Black Thursday; [how very like toy 

 mother's 1"
