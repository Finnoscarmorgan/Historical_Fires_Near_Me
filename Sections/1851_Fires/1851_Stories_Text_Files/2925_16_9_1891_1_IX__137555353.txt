'I did not know him,' tho girl ro turued, 'but I have hoard Charles say 

 that.it was not known for cortain whether he had gone tlioro or not. He ofton ex pressed a wish that ho would return. I . . am sure Charles had not tho slightest ill . : will to his stop- brother.' ? : ' Of coarso the younger son wbuld in . lierit tho ontiro fortune if the older wero thus repudiated.' ' I' do not know in what manner Mr. ....... ? Edgar proposed disposing of his fortune,' u . . aliis ausivered ; '' and I am sure any such motive of onriohing himself at his - . -.brother's expense never entered tho head ottho younger one.' ' Ot oourso not,' answered tholnspce tor, soothingly, for his visitor was begin ing to show signs of indignation at tho . , thought of anyono imputing mercenary ????i.r ......... motives to her lato lover. u From what I havo heard of Charles ? ; y ; y. .. Edgar, I believe him to havo boon a kind-hearted, cxcollont young man, and 1 hope, Miss Devoroaux, that wo will, ere loHJf,. find him alivo and woll.' Ho said this to conaolo tho poor girl, for her wan face and wistful manners ,v . touched hun. 'God grant that you fnaj',' bIio fervently replied, and then the Inspec .; tor. accompamod her .to the door, as she w ished to go. . - ' Lynx will be hero at nine o'clock to morrow morningj-and if you will give me .v- your address X will sohd him to you.'

Ho gavo Miss Dovoreaux instructions how to loach .Mi Ronnie's selections, but ? . excused hitnaulf from accompanying lier by saying that Ins presence would not bo agreonblo to tho young man, and would look like n mciiacc.

Victorian legislators as a rule do not si nid high in tho estimation of tho more ihAughlful poitiun of tho community. 1 Occasionally a demagogue rises who with 1 gill)' pronnsos to tho masses attains a ti'inporary popularity not warranted by 1 the Acts I10 pi ices 011 tho Statute Book, ; . hut taking our Houses of Parliament in ? ^ Outioral their members havo done much i to ^osorvo tho respect of tho people. 1 r : ? ? ; Assuredly 0110 of tho most beneficial . - ?

 old land, who scarcely own tho rays which covor them, and *vlio, if not par tially supported by the parish, aro pen sioners of noblemen or other lauded magnates, is noticeably absent in coun tries that allow llio many, and not the few to possess the laud. iSothing is perfect of course ill this im porlect world, bul with all their faults tho Australian Land Acts havo dono much to ensure tho futuro stability and prosperity �f this great continent, which, liko the rising sun, is now boginning to throw a few straggling beams 011 the hori zon of history. lighting it up with tho rosy tints of dawn, and foreshadowing tho dazzling effulgcnee which will mark the meridian of Australia's progress. Amongst the foremost to tako advan tage of tho lirst laud act was Ronnie. Since the mysterious disappoarauco of his tourist conipmiion, Edgar, with its tragical surroundings, ho had remained lU Molbourno, shunned by his few ac quaintances, nnd fooling that he was sus pected of knowing moro than ho cared to divulge of the fato of his lato com rade. llio missing man's father hadcomo over from Sydnoy to seek for his aon, and lie had oflored a reward of �1000 for his dis covery alivo or djad. It was in vain, for though numerous search parlies eager to obtain tho reward scoured the mountain ranges, not tho slightest trace could bo found, and aftera stay of three months in Melbourne, tho disconsolate father returned to his lonely and stricken homo. Ho had soveral interviews with Ronnio during his visit, and though his mind was clouded with suspicion against him at first, his sinister thoughts wero gradually removed, and ho left tho young man with the_ full conviction that ho 'was perfectly innoceiit-of any part in his son's disappearance. Rennie solemnly assured him that lie would make it his life's task to lift llio shadow that had thus suddenly fallen Rcross their lives, and darkened tho futuro of both, aud with this assurance the old man departed, feeling that as long as Itennio lived no effort would, bo spared to solvo tho strange pro blem. During tho first rush of land selection it wa3 not necessary to go far inland for a | suitable area, and R'jnnie had a bowilder ing choice of good lots. Tho stigma of guilt, however, which was attached to him by his follow 111011, nnd which the newspapers gave wido publicity to by many insinuations, inado him to aonio oxlont a misan thrope. His gregarious instincts had, for tho time, been effaced by tho ruthless hand of tho slanderer and the falBo judgment his fellow nion had formed of him, and ho decided to withdraw as much as possiblo from tho world, that is, aa much as would be consouant with his desire to unravel tho mystery of Clinrles Edgar. ? The mountain ponks of Macedon and Diogenes possessed a fascination for him, aud ho folt uneasy wlion out'of sight of these towering land marks. His }uost for land, combined with his desiro to avoid tho bu3y haunts of men, led his footsteps into tho heart of tho Black Foivst, and about toil miles from Macodon, and iu full view of the mounts, at tho source of tho Campaspo river, ho decided to sottlo. Tho locality at that time was indescrib ably wild, Immense trees grow so thickly that in somo places the beams of tho sun nevor penetrated. In spots, pntohes, had beon cleared away by the groat whirlwind of fire on Black Thursday, which ravaged tho colc brated forest. Choppy ranges and narrow valleys serrated tho country liko tho teeth of a saw, and loft out small tracks of flat land. Tho soil was, however, excel lent. Tho wood cuttor and tho saw-millor had begun their work of subduing tho forest 011 difforont sides of Rennie's selec tion, but somo milos from him. Towards Woodond tho timber was being rapidly sent to Melbourne, whilst tho mining districts of Blackwood and Daylesford wore gradually extending their clearings into tho primeval woods. To-day tho black forest exists but as a legend and tho S';ene of many strange ad ventures, yet thirty years ago the axo had scarcely touched it ; so do wo progress in this young and vigorous land. Tho head of tho Campaspo, which, rising 111 tho honvt of tho forest, flows through tho fertile districts of Carlsrhue, Kyneton, past Bendigo, and ovor tho northern plains of Elmoro nnd lioehenlor into tlie Murray at Ecliuca, was a roman tic and beautiful spot. Starting from a clnar apring it in a short distance is augmonted to a peren nial stream. Flowing over a rocky bod tho wator is so crystal like that tho small black fish, with which it abounds, can be plainly seen swimming around at a depth of livo or six feet, while tho tiny� so called trout � float, visiblo liko amber specs, at oven a greater depth. In a distance of five miles from tho sourco thoro aro 110 less than four water falis.of surpassing loveliness. At those places the solid rook has by somo means been scooped out, probably by tho washing away of soft strata, and tho novor-coa3ing action of tho wator has caused tho most curious and gro toBquo formations. Somo of them riso out of thoir liqyid bed statuo liko, as horrible and repol lant as Chinese Gods, whilst others aB BUino tho shape of difforent birda and animals. In ono instance, a ma.gnifioont rock, about ton foot high, exactly resembles a petrified Kangaroo, whilst another is the verisimilitude of a gigantic squatting duck; indeed, a small noojogical collodion in stono could 00 mado hero. Strange hollows and bore holes aro worn iu tho solid rock, somo of them, saucer shaped, and otliors perfectly round uid apparently bottoinlo-is. Tlieso aro lilleit with tho crystal 'wator, and teem with small fish. It would bo a paradiso tor tho eel, but tlieso aerpontliko fish aro not found in any river north of the Dividing Rango. Aftor running ovor tho vast table rock ivhore tho rmturai' museum of curiosities ;s placed, tho bright wator falls ovor a edgo of rocks a dislanco of about fifteen foot, sparkling like diamonds, into a still pool below, which numerous wild fowls nako thoir haunts a3 abundant food is found, and tho solemn quiotnoas of tho' ipot makes it still moro acceptablo. Tho banks aro lined with tho wild rasp- ; jerry, ovor which tiio wattle tree bends, md towering above all, tlioao grand old 1 I'itacs of tho forest � tho eucalypti � ;hrow out their protecting urme, the ' vholo funning a picture of river beauty i eldoin equalled and novor oxcelled. Tho first ten miles of tho Cumpaipe is i . succession of scenes liko this, after 1 vhich a romarkablo ohange for tho worse I akes place wlion it runs through sottlo- 3 1 nont, and it beoomoa � prosaic and 1 1 auddy bontoacouruo. Fjrpin near Bendigo ! 

 to its estuary it i'b an uninviting and un romantic channel. Tho river may be taken as an emblem of human lifo. Startirg out with tho purity, quiet and innocence of childhood and romance of youth, which looks at tho world with tho bright, though delusive oyes of Hope. Contact with the realily speedily works a change for tho worse, Tho innocence and peaco of childhood dis appears before the sin and storms of the world, and tho purity of our youth is supplanted by the tur�id passions of our more mattiro age. The glowing anticipations � tho castles in the air � of our early yoars, fade away and leave nothing but the dull and spirit loss thoughts � tho ' might havo boons,' of declining ago, and wo glido into tho gravo to mix our dust with generations who havo gone before us, and who started out on tho river of lifo with tho same bright promise. Human lifo has many similes. Ronnio had some difficulty in pursuad ing himself to sottlo down in tho wild and lonely paradiso I10 had 3olectcd' for his homo. Used to choorful company, and brought up in a city, it required no slight wrench to fonnor lubita to bury himself in his hermit liko rotreat. He waa a comparative novice to bush lifo, but when ho finally determined to become a free selector 011 tho C.nnpnBpo, 110 went into tho work with vigor. Employing a few experienced bush men, thoy soon cleared a fow acres and built a substantial log house, alter which they fenced in tho ground, and Earnest Ronnio had fairly joined the army of small settlors who wero fast over-running tho colony. Ho had seven hundred pounds and ex pectations from Home, so that I10 was in an immeasurably better position than most other selectors, who took up land with scarcoly enough capital to pay the survey foes, and who tor years after toiled like galley slaves in abject poverty 111 what was frequently a vain attempt to obtain tho foe simple of the ground. Men liko Rennie who had capital ulti mately bought out such alruggling peoplo, and increased their original small hold ings to dimensions which wero ample to combine grazing with agricultural pur suits. Within twelve months of Ronnie's settlomout at tho head of the Campaspo, nearly tho wholo of the land along tho river had been pegged out and applied for by various pooplo, so that tho pioneer soon had neighbours who frequently broke in upon the privacy of liia wild retreat. CHAPTER XT. hknnie's hosik. It waa a rough journey through a wild country which Miss Dovoreaux had to travel in ordor to roach Ronnie's new home. Tho Bound of crashing trees falling beforo tho woodman's axo broko upon tho oar, and in overy direction tho remains of stately oucalypti, with a small portion only, of tho trunk takou away for uso, woro lying around. Tho waste of fine timbor was almost be yond conception, and it induced a bitter Nemesis soon aftor; for the vast quantity of fallon timber, whon it became dry, took fire, and swept away many homes and tho fruits of much labor. Although distant from Woodend only seven miles, it occupied fully two hours to roach Ronnie's clearing. Tliero waa no road, aavo the tracks mado by tho wood cartcrs which led nowhere iu particular, und tho Bteop ranges woro not easily sur mounted. It was mid-day whon tiioy reached thoir destination, and as thoy stopped for n moment 011 the Lop of a high range,' overlooking llio head of the Campaspo, Miss Deveroaux was nurprised to soe the change that had beon wrought 011 Rennio's selection. A apaco of fully a hundred acres had been cloarod during tho short time the occupant had been iu possession, and a numbor of men with teams of bullocks were still busily engaged iu tho work. A rough, though substantial liouso stood 011 a slight eminence in tho middlo of the clearing, and several other smaller elections were visiblo a f-hort distanco further on. Towards the main building tho driver wont, and ai thoy imared it a thoughtful, sad-eyed man came out to meet them with n cordial wolcome. As ho lo'oked at tho lady his face grow a shade paler, for he at once, recognised her as Miss Dovoreaux, though bIic ap peared years oldor than tho eight months since I10 had soon her would warrant. Ha easily guessed the reason. 'Mr. iieuiiio,' she said, leaping out of tho vohiele,' I am glad to soe you again,' and alio wont towards him with extondod hand. Hor kind grooting roassurod him, for ho hail oxpectbd reproachful glancpa and bitter words from tho girl whoso lover lie waa tho moans of bringing to Victoria away from her sido. ' I am sincerely glad to see you, -Miss Deveroaux. If i had known of your in tended vi3it I would have mot you at the station and brought you ovor. It is a rough road.' With all liia old graco I10 invited her inside, and shu found the interior much moro coinfi.rtablo than alio expected. ' I havo two married 111011 working for nio,' ho explained. 'Thoir wivca nnd families livo in yoqder cottages, and tho women look after my poor liouso and do the co.iking. So you soo 1 am' not such a hermit as you might think.' . Jus1, thon one of tho women caino into the room, and Ronnio introduced her as Mrs. Afilecic, and requested hor to' wait on Mias Deveroaux wliilo alio romaiued with them. Tho young lady expiwiaed hor intention of returning to Woodond during the oourso of the afternoon, but Ronnio beggod her not to go until, at loast, llio following day. ' Wo cut make you quite comfortable liore, I assure you,' I10 urged, 'and you will find a fow days' change in tho bush qnito a relief from tho bustle and worry of eity life. B sides, you must be tirad out. Sho was not anxious to leave, and was easily perauadod to remain. Mrs. Aflleclc was a good, motherly woman, and Adeline was soon quito at homo with hor. Aftorchanging hor dress and partaking of a plain but wholosome meal, Miss Deveroaux accoptod Romiio's invitation to viow tho clearing operations. Bucked up with the needful money, tho young selector had certainly worked wonders iii the primeval forest, and waB rapidly making a, comfortable lionio. As thoy walked around, tho thought which was uppermost in their minds found vent, 'My dear friend,' Ronnio sai.!, turn ing to tho young girl, and spoaki;.g in a ,oiv voico, ' I know you havo come to liia colony iu search of your promised lusband, and my host friend. Charles 'Odg.ii'. 1 ' ilia strange disappearance lias thrown 

 | o shadow over both our lives. I know it has been a fearful blow to you, and to me it seems like a awful dream, from which I shall a.val.o and find that I havo been indeed dreaming, and see you and Charles IMgar passing through life hand in hand together.^ I have been almost hunted fi um my fellow-men by a foul and unjuBt suspicion, but I felt rewarded to-day for all I havo suflV-rod when you clasped my hand and 1 read in your face my inno cence proclaimed there.' j ' Never for ono moment,' aym- j pathetically answered tho young girl, 'did X think you were to blame for Charley's disappearance. I know that you had a geituino affection for him, and if I can read character at all, I believe ?you would not Btoop to a mean aud ignoblo action, mcch less to embruo your hands in innocent blood. 'No. Mr. Ronnie, do not lot ub over talk of such an absurd suspicion. But aa we are both interested � deoply interested � I claim your Help in clearing the mystery up. Assure aa tho sun shines in the lioavena, if a foul crinic has been committed, justice, though tardy, will overtako tho criminal, and if not, wo inuat only tru3t in an over-ruling Pro vidence to show ub light where now all is darkness. I havo dedicated my llio to that 011c purpose, and I shall nevor reat content until I know tho fato of Charles Edgar.' She spoke in such a determined voice that her companion could not liolp looking at hor. Tho flashing oyes and heaving breaat boro eloquent testimony to the excite mont under which alio labored. ' Our mission in life is tho same,' an swered tho young man, ' for I havo made a vow nover to miss an opportunity of lifting tho dark veil which enshrouds tho fate of Mr. Edgar. ' Possessed with that idea,' I10 wont on, ' I could not livo out of .sight of the last place I saw my friend. There,' and ho pointod in an eastorly direction, aB the shuddering girl looked, 'ia the Camel's Hump, the second peak from here.. On that ill-fated mount I atood with your afiiauced husband not quito a year ago, when tho fatal mist came on aud hid him from viow. Strangely aB he vanished, I yet believe I shall hear of him again, and every scrap of information that I can ob tain from pioneers of tho mount I treasure up for future uao. I havo been told of a s'. range old woman who lives alone in tho wildcat part of these ranges, nnd I in tend to visit her shortly and Bee if she can furniBh mo with any clue.' 'It was stated in tho papers that an other man named Marshall, a member of II survey party, was lost on that fatal peak the samo day no Charies. Did you soo a third person on the summit?' sho asked. ' No ; and we rested for an hour under tho landmark or trigonometrical station which this man was sent to inspect. I do not think ho could have been on the mount when wo woro, because at firat thoro was no fog, and the area i3 so Bmall that we must havo met. Bosidea, a few minutes beforo tho fog enveloped ub, Edgar fired at a goat, and tho discharge of tho gun reverberated amongst the rocks with a noiso like thunder, which must Biirely have' attracted attontion in- that lonely spot.' Talking in this manner about tho loat one thoy both loved bo dearly, the young peoplo Blowly roturned to the house. Thoy both felt happier, for they had opened their hearts and shared their sor rows and thoir hopes with oach other. Thoy were both of tho Bamo purpose, re garding thoir futuro action towards the missing man. Tho power of human sympathy is as tonishing, for that evening Adeline Devereaux and Ernest Rennio, conscious of a mutual sympathy with each other's griefs, passed tho hours far happier than they had dono since tho young man spout that terriblo night alone in tho damp cave 011 tho ' Camel's Hump.' Adeline told him anything of interest that had transpired ill Sydney, and Rennio was deeply affected as I10 pic tured to himself tho childless couplo at Parramatta, who, instead of receiving the bleasings of happiness in thoir old age, were tottering to tho-gravo under an nfilicting load of sorrow � tho first born driven from the door liko a pariah, and tho lato of tho younger wrapped in a dark and impenetrable pall of tnystory. It was nearly midnight � a rather lato hour for bush settlers � when Miss Dovcreaux retired with Mra. Affleck, and as sho lay in bed thinking over the events of tho day, sho folt, with a alight thrill of pleasure, that she was not quite alone in tho world ao lung as Ernest Rennio lived. For tlie first time in many months sho fell into a peaceful and refreshing slumber, undisturbed by dreams of dizzy precipicos or murdered men, and when she awoke the sun waa brightly streaming through tho window, and tho sounds of lifo outsido told hor that tho curUin of another day was lifted, and tho human actors wero about to play their parts. CHAPTER XII. THE SUN WILL ItlSE AGAIN TO-MORROW. Tho days paased swiftly to Misa Deveroaux in the new lifo alio led in tho wild Black Forest on Rentiio's selec tion. Tho visit of a day had lengthened into a weok, and still sho waa loth to go, and her young host was most importunato in his requoatB for her to remain. ' If you will do 1110 tho favor to stay for another wool: I will go to Molbourno with you,' lie said. ' I havo a slight clue, of perhaps no importance, that I wish to givo tho detectives, and if it does nothing olso it may spur thorn on to ro nowed oxertiona.' Ho gavo tho girl an ovasivo answer as to what tho cluo was, for if there waa any truth in the story I10 hoard it pointod to fact that Charles Edgar muat havo beon murdered. It was only a tap-room yarn. In talk ing with ono of his original cmployoa about tho affair which had croated sucli a sensation, tho old follow, who was fond of his grog whon noar a shanty, recollected that about tho time it happened, a weary looking, rostlosa man camo into tho bar of tho Hanging Rock hotel, near Woodend, and indulgod very froely in whisky. It waa not long before ho got drunk, and be gan to bohave liko a madman. Tho land lord tried to quioton him, but his ap proaches wero mot in tho most bollicoso mannor. After a timo tho drunkon fellow sud denly calmed down, and going towards tho peacemaker, looked fixedly at him for a few moments, and thon slowly said, with a strangoly wild glitter in his oyes : ' Look hero, you scoundrel. If you daro to cross ino in my purposo I will fling you over a cliff as I did luy onemy yester day ; aye, down, down to hell I'll send you.' � (To bo continued) MM J
