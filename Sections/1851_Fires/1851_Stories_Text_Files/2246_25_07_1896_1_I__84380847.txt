BLACK THURSDAY. 

 IN FIVE CHAPTERS. 

 CHAPTER I. 

 AS the voyager approaches the 

 shores of Victoria, the first welcome land which greets him is the bold promontory of Cape Otway. If it be at night, the blaze from the lighthouse on its southern point sends him its cheering welcome for many a league across the ocean and calls forth rapturous hurrahs from the throng of passengers who crowd to the forecastle. If it be day, the eye rests on its lofty forest hills with a quiet and singular delight. These heights fully respond to the ideal of a new land only recently peopled. Clothed with forests from the margin of the sea to their very summits, they realise vividly the approach to a vast region of primeval nature. The tall white stems of the gum-trees stand thickly side by side like so many hoary columns ; and, here and there amongst them descend dark ravines while piles of rocks on the heights, alternate with projecting spars of the mountains and present their solitary masses to the breeze of the ocean. 

 

 Amongst the rocks of this wild 

 shore there are sea-caves of vast extent 

 and solemn aspect, which have never yet been thoroughly explored. The forest extending fifty miles or more, in all directions, is one of the most dense and savage in the whole colony. Until lately it was almost impassable because of the density of the scrub, and from the thick masses of vines ( that is lianas, or creeping cord like plants, chiefly parasitical), which, as in the forests of South America, climb from tree to tree, knitting the woods into an obscure and impenetrable shade. Excepting along the track from Mr. Roadknight's station, near the sources of the Barwar, through the heart of the forest to Apollo Bay, a distance of forty miles, you might cut your way with an axe; but would find it difficult to make progress otherwise. The greater part of the promontory�consisting of steep hills covered with gigantic trees intersected by shelving valleys, and dark with congregated fern-trees, beetling precipices, and stony declivities - afford no food for cattle. In one day, however, known to the colonists as Black Thursday, a hurricane of flame opened its rude and impracticable wildernesses to the foot of man : but presented him at the same time, with a black and blasted chaos of charred trees, and gigantic fallen trunks and branches. 

 It was in this forest, in the early morning of this memorable day, the sixth of February, eighteen hundred and fifty-one, that a young man opened hia eyes and sat up to look about him. He had, the day before, driven a herd of fifty bullocks from the station of Mr. Roadknight thus far on his way towards his own residence in the country, between Lake Corangamite and Mount Gellibrand. By evening, he had reached the small grassy valley in the outskirts of the forest watered by a creek falling into the western Barwar ; and had there paused for the night. His mob of cattle, tired and hungry, were not inclined to stray from the rich pasturage before them and, hobbling out his splendid black horse Sorcerer, he prepared to pass the night in ths simple fashion of the settler on such journeys. A fallen log supplied him with a convenient seat, a fire was quickly lit from tho dead boughs which lay plentifully around, and his quart-pot, replenished at the creek, was soon hissing and bubbling with its side thrust into the glowing fire. He had a good store of kangaroo-sandwiches, and there he sat with his cup of strong bush-tea, looking alternately at the grazing cattle, and into the solemn, gloomy and soundless woods, in which even the laughing jackass failed to shout his clamorous adieu to the falling day. Only the distant monotone of the morepork�the nocturnal cuckoo of the Australian wilds� reached his ear, making the profound solitude still more solitary. He very soon rolled himself in his travelling rug and flung himself down before the fire�near where his trusty dogs lay and where Sorcerer, in the favourite fashion of the bush-horse, slept as he stood. 

 The morning was hushed and breathless. Instead of that bracing chill, with which the Australian traveller out of doors generally wakes up, Robert Patterson found the perspiration standing thick on his face, and he felt a strange longing for a deep breath of fresh air. But motion there was none, except in the little creek which trickled with a fresh and inviting aspect a few yards away from him. He arose, and stripping, plunged into the deepest spot of it that he could find, and thus refreshed, rekindled his fire and made his solitary breakfast. But ail around him hung, as it were, a leaden and death-like heaviness. Not a bough nor a blade of grass was moved by the air. The trees stood inanimately moody and sullen. He cast his eyes through the gloomy 

 shadow beneath them, and a sultry, suffocating density seemed to charge the atmosphere. The sky above him was dimmed by a grey haze. 

 " There is something in the wind today, old fellow," he said, addressing his horse in his usual way ; for he had long looked upon him as a companion, and firmly believed that he understood 

 all that he said to him. " There is something in the wind : yet, where is the wind ?" 

 

 The perspiration streamed from him with the mere exertion of saddling his horse, and, as he mounted him to rouse up his cattle. Horse, dogs, and cattle, manifested a listlessness that only an extraordinary condition of the atmosphere could produce. If you had seen the tall, handsome young man seated on his tall and noble horse, you would have felt that they were together formed for any exploit of strength and speed. But the whole troop�cattle, man, and horse� went slowly and soberly along, as if they were oppressed by a great fatigue or the extreme exhaustion of famine. 

 The forest closed in upon them again, and they proceeded along a narrow track, flanked on each side by tall and densely-growing trees ; the creeping vines making of the whole forest one intricate, impenetrable scene. All was hushed at midnight. No bird enlivened the solitude by its cries and they had left the little stream. Suddenly there came a puff of air, but it was like the air from the jaws of a furnace, hot, dry, withering in its very touch. The young settler looked quickly in the direction from which it came, and instantly shouted to the cattle before him, a wild, abrupt, startling shout, swung aloft the stockwhip which he held in his hand, and brought it down with the report of a pistol, and the sharp cut as with a knife, on the ear of the huge bullock just before him. The stockwhip, with a handle about half a yard long and a thong of three yards 

 of plaited bullock-hide, is a terrible instrument in the hands of a practised stockman. Its sound is the note of terror to the cattle, it is like the report of a blunderbuss and the stockman at full gallop will hit any given spot on the beast that he is within reach of and cut the piece clean away through the thickest hide that bull or bison ever wore. He will strike a fly on a spot of mud at full speed, and take away the skin with him, making the rosy blood spring into the wind and the astonished animal dart forward as if mad. 

 Louder and louder, wilder and more fiercely shouted the squatter, and 

 dashed his horse forward over fallen trees ; through crashing thickets, first on one side of the road, and then on the other. Crack crack, went the stinging, slashing whip ; loud was the barking of dogs and the mob of cattle rushed forward at headlong speed. The young man gazed upward and through the only narrow opening of the forest, saw strange volumes of smoke rolling southward. Hotter, hotter, stronger and more steadily came the wind. He suddenly checked his horse, and listening, grew pale at the sound which reached him. It was a low deep roar, as of a wind in the tree-tops, or of a heavy waterfall, distant and smothered in some deep ravine.
