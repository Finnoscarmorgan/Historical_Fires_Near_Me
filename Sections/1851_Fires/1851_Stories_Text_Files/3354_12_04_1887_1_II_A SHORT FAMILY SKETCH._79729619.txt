CHAPTER II. 

 A BHOBT FAMILY SKETCH. 

 Tbe reader has no doubt already recognised our hero, Arthur Landon, in tho person of the young buBhman who arrived bo oppor tunely, and BO heroically rescued (bo little Nina from the jaws olthe devouring olament 

 | on " Blaok Thursday." Arthur Landon, ! though young and not very attractive in ap 1 pearance, possessed may qualitieH which, in i the bush of Australia, would entitle Iiim to 

 the claims of a hero. Brought up under the : watchful oyes of fond and virtuous parents, , and naturally brave and honorable in his 

 disposition, possessing most accomplish ments necessary for a bold and thorough bushman-these advantages, oombined with ' a warm and aSecti6nate heart, made him 

 already a great favorite with all who knew 

 him. 

 His father, George Landon, being of re spectable parents in tbe mother country, took his passage out to Sydney when Arthui -who was the eldest of the family-was bu' two years old. His mother had been marriet before to a young member of family 6. the aristooraoy, and an heir to an estate, bui died suddenly^ after the birth of an onlj daughter, leaving his young widow-whom i he married against the oonBent of his parents j -unprovided for. 

 His relatione took charge of his infant ' daughter in order to bring her up in o ' manner becoming an heiress to an estate. 1 The widow, thus uncared for by hor late i husband's relatives, at laet consented to be- ! oome George Landon's wifo-he being a 1 suitor of hers before her first marriage. This 1 last act closed tbe hearts of her first hue- | band's friends against her, and deprived her | of ever receiving any favors at their hands. I George Landon, wboBe means were not adequate to keep the style to whioh he and bis wife were aoaustomed in their former 

 days, and before all their little capit al Bhould ; exhausted they resolved on emigrating to Aus- | tralia in order to better their ciroumstanoes. There they could put up with many Incon veniences, and be free from the critical gaze of the fashionable world. George Landon had not calculated on the heavy expenses of outfit and passage money, and on arriving in Sydney he found his small capital at a far lower hoad than ho anticipated. He, how ever, possessed a manful heart and persever ing mind, which made np for loss of capital. After remaing a short lima in Sydney, he had been advised to purchase a few head of cattle and horses, and to find some grazing country where they might increase in a short tims. But after purchasing tbe stock be found out by experience that the grazing oountry was not altogether so easily dis covered as be expected, and, after shifting from one place to another, he at last faund some rough oountry in the Maneroo dietriot, at the foot of the Australian Alps. 

 In this wild region he settled down with his stock for a short time, when he was joined by a decent and industrious Irishman named Haley, who had been lately married to a nicc oountry girl of his own. Being within four miles of each other, and their runs joining, the two small squatters became . great help and protection to ono another. TtauB they lived for yoars on the best fooling and in perfect harmony, while their families 

 and stock increased. 

 They had to go through a good deal of hardship, as may be expected, for tho first years of their squatting, nntil their children gTew up. But that succour oame by degrees, especially to Landon, as Arthur Boon became an aetive and useful iad in tbe bush among 

 the stock. 

 Haley was not so fortunate, for his eldest ohild was a daughter, and four years Arthur 

 Landon's junior. 

 Nevertheless Kathleen Haley soon beoame useful, and could ride as well through the wild ranges as any young stockman in Aus tralia, for she had an excellent tutor in Arthur who took great pains in her caupht rian instructions. Arthur also gave Haley often a hand in mustering, branding, and looking after hie stock, as well as his own lather's; andas Kathleen-wbo.was growing np very fast like all other native girls-rode with hta on these occasions, a close intimaoy sprung up between them which at last de veloped into a more tender feeling. 

 We have already given an imperfect sketch 

 of Arthur'slooks and, although they were not i calculated to make a " heavy impression " on a fcmale's heart, nevertheless Kathleen Haley dieooverd certain attractions in her young 

 neighbor's bronzed visage and piercing black | eyea. Although she kept these impreBBions 

 sealed within her young and virgin bosom, | she often acknowledged to herself that Arthur waB tho only " pcrfeot" young man that she ever beheld. Nothing was done properly un less he had a hand in it. She would not ride a young oolt unless be had the breaking of it in. _ Her saddle, bridle, or any other little artiolc belonging to her riding gear must pass through bis hands; and even her habit and other dreBses bad to be left to his judgment before she could wear them. 

 Wc must not therefore be surprised thBt with all the oonfidenccB plaoed in bim by hie fair neighbor, Arthur could not resist lov ing Kathleen. In addition to such strong olaims on bis affections,there were tar greater oharms connected with the young lady, whioh would prove fatal to a more experienced heart than our hero's, for Kathleen Haley was one of the most beautiful and lovely orcalures that the world ever produoed. To give even a vague idea of her looks is not in the power of my pen to deBoribs j the reader, therefore, must form in bis own mind a being possessed of all the beauty and innocence of our first mother before bcr fall. Tbe golden treeses falling in their wanton and natural state around tbe awan-Iiko neok and shoulders. The pure and health; rose whioh mantled the blooming cheeks ; tne sparkling 

 and betwitahing twinkle of the dark bine eyes; ; ths sweet and onchanting smile of the full and pouting lips, whioh rivalled the redness of a oherry; toe well-Bet and exquisite ivory teeth; the well-rounded and child-like ohin, and tbe broad, hut not too high, marble brow, and, above all, the elastio and graoeful form, whose unrivalled mould was ravishing to be 

 hold, when its fair owner rode with eaoh oon- ' fidenco and ease her spirited steed over all I the obstaoles whioh the wild and billy oottn- ' 

 try presented. 

 It may be a bold statement to make, ba it is nevertheless true, that it is questionable whether any other spot under the sun oan produce suoh feminine lovlineBe, natural simplioity, oombined with sprightlineis and 

 vivaoity, L.* the wild bush of Australia. i 

 Tlio exoiting and healthy exeroisc they in 

 dulge in, riding spirited horses over rough | and dangerous country, bringe forth all ; their courage and nerve, and nives them that blooming appearance of countenance and to their oycfi that sparkling and bril liant light. The Australian native girle brought up under the careful guardianship of virtuous and pious parentH, untrammelled by tlic formal and artificial customs of town societies; their hearts and miuds un contaminatcd and uncorrupted by worldly eoandal, or tho Reductive whispers of the unprincipled libertine, livo in their own pure atmosphere of perfect innocence. Such characters may bo rare, yet there arc some, and Kathleen was one of the number. 

 She had enjoyed all those advantages which improve the virgin mind and instruct it in all tliose moral habits BO conduoive to a virtuous life, for, besides her own parents' unimpeachablo example, the moro ladylike and rcQncd manners of Mrs. Landon Arthur's mother-inspired the fertile mind and quick perception uf Kathleen Haloy with high and lofty principles rarely met with in 

 : the bush. 

 1 Alter giving the above sketch of tho fair ' Kathleen, we must not leave in the ehade 

 another beautiful flower in this wild forest. 1 Eliza-or Lizzie she was moro often called 

 Arthur Landon's eldest sister, and a dear friend of Kathleen Ilalcj's. Lizzie Landon, although of quite o diflereut cast of beauty, i was to some people's taste moro lovely. Ilor 

 hair, eyei and eyebrows were black like her brother Arthur's, hut her akin v<as as whito and pure as the driven snow, without any color in her conntenanee save a slight delicate shade when riding or taking ex ercise. Her features and figure were fault ! less, and thoro was an irresistible expression 

 of langour in her liquid black eyes which gave a charm to her pale countenance, and filled tbe soul of tho beholder with admira tion. Lizzie's manner and temperament was more refined and meek,with loss ppright lineaa and vivaoity than her fair neighbour and companion, Kathleen. She was also more timid in riding, and her whole obarac tcristios wore more reserved and lady-like propably after her mother, whose polishod manner she nlriotly imitated. She Beldom rode with Arthur and Kathleen over the ranges when after stook, cxcept on speoial occasions, and for exercise or pleasure. 

 We must not omit to mention here that theso two lovely flowers did not spring up without some neoessary oulture, for their parents-particularly Mrs. Landon - not ' wiilistanding the pressure of household , duties, took every opportunity cf teaching 

 their children, eo that they oould read and 

 mite well. 

 Arthur supplied them with books; wben 

 J ever he paid a visit to any village or town 

 i he invariably bought a supply, among which ' were eome of the best and latest novels of tbe 

 ' day, and we mast admit that "Scott," I " Bulwcr," and somo celebrated lady writers 

 had a share in forming tbe young minds of I these beautiful children of nature. 

 I Thus they grew up in their innooenoe and 

 loveliness, onoonsoious of their many charms | and that their graeelal forms were develop i ing and verging on womanhood, until Arthur I returned from his trip to Melbourne after 

 " Black Thursday," when they had attained their thirteen yean. 

 WomuBtnow enlighten the reader! as to tho reason or business which brought our hero to Melbourne, and which directed him towards the Upper Plenty (�8 referred to in tbe first ohaptor. 

 Arthur had been several times before this entrusted with the Bale of his father's and Haley's stock, both in Twofold bay and Gippsland markets, where he disposed of them at satisfactory prices, considering the times. But this season, bb these plaoes did 

 uot offer any indnoement regarding prices of etook, he accompanied a notable dealer named Jaok Trenton-or Tantrum as he was often styled-and who will make a prominent figure in our tale. Arthur accord ingly joined his mob with those of the cele brated Tantrum, and, after a fatiguing and scorching journey through the " snowy mountains," Gippsland, and " Fernkee gullies," arrived at last in the great metro polis of Victoria. 

 Unfortunately, at that time, and before the golden era which was soon to follow, the markets were glutted, eo that they were obliged to wait until a rise in stock should tako plaoo, and had therefore to send them 

 40 a paddock situated on the Plenty, from 

 rhich some of the horses broke out and 

 strayed to the ranges. Arthur had been in searoh of them on that memorable morning, when the bushfircs drove him out. 

 Tbe reader is already informed of the Barrow eBoape he had on that occasion, and all we have got to say now is how he acted after leaving Mr. Whitford's-or rather Oalder'o residence. 

 His garments were still wet, as may be supposed, after bis long soaking in the 

 Eond, but this, instead of discommoding 

 fan, proved a great comfort on suoh a 

 soorobing day. His horse also benefited by the bath he took, and carried its well-ex perienoed rider safely to Melbourne, bom whencohesent a medical man in post haute to the poor invalid. 

 It must be remembered here that our hero's thoughts dwelt upon many specula tions while on tho way to town. The Strang! impressions made npon his sensitive mind by the invalid mother and ber little daughter oconrred to him on every oooasion; nor oould ho drive her beautiful and delicate looks from bis eyes. But hor voice beld a more powerful impression OP his imagina tion, "How very like my mother's voioel" was an expression whioh often eBoaped his Hps. 

 " And that sweet little girl; how fond I got of her all at onoe," bo would add, and the whole event appeared BO strange and mysterious. 

 A few days after this the straysd horses were found, and an improvement in the stook market had taken place. They accord ingly disposed of tbe wholo mob at a fair prioe. 

 Our hero, although a very abstemious young man, nnioyedhimpelf on his first trip to the city. Every novelty presented in that grand plaoa was observed and imprinted on bis mind vividly, particularly the plays at the theatre. " Borneo and Juliet" had been enaoted on one of thcEo occasions, and our hero, who took great delight in reading Shakespearo'a plays, for the first time beheld them acted. lie consequently took immense delight in tbe same, and determined to store ap in his mind that and all other novelties be bad scon, in order to repeat them to his siBter Lizzy and playmate Kathleen. Not withstanding the flna dresses and other artificial improvements in the persons and faoeB of tho Melbourne ladies, ho oould not see any among them who could rival Kath leen in beauty as ho thought. But she WBB only a ohild as yet, in his imagination, whom he bad known from infanoy. Thus he argued to himself until hi? return home>
