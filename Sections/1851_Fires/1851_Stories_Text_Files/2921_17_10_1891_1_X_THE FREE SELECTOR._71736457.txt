CHAPTER X. 

 ; THE MIKE SELECTOR. 

 ].}.. Victorian legislators as a rule do riot Kc�staud high in the estimation of the more 

 lllllb^uglilful portion of tho.community. tia!.<5c*asionally a demagogue rises who with 

 ''glib promises to the masses attains a 'temporary popularity not wnrranted by 

 tho Acts ho places on the Statute Book, but taking our Houses of Parliament in Cronoral their members have done much ' ' to dosorvo tho respect of the people. 

 Assuredly one of the most bonoficial steps that wan ever taken to ensure the : prosperity nf Victoria was the system of 

 freo land selection, which waa inaugu 

 r>- * rated in tho "sixties." 

 Like overy othor innovation its first principios, crude as they necessarily �.oro, may have aided to swell the already laigo estatOB which tho act was intended to "prevent, but tho general result of the new depurturo lias been to settle on the land a sturdy yeomanry-which, wo aro , told, is the backbone of a country. 

 Judging by tho history of France this is true, fur tito poliay which aims at mak ing each man his own landlord tends to imh-u the great problem, exemplified in tho irish Question, of national quietude. 

 If tho axiom that an Englishman's luiiiio is his oastlo bo truo, how much moro forcibly may it be applied to the . mau who owns the fee simple of the soil 

 surrounding his houao. 

 Such ownorship produces n sense of in dependence which cannot fail to raise tho �standard of mankind in tho country �ii�eh allows such an opportunity to its 

 inhabitants.

 old land, who scarcely own the ragi which cover them, and who, if not par tially supported by the parish, are pen sioners of noblemen ur other landed magnates, is noticeably absent in coun tries that allow the many, and not thc few to possess thc land. 

 Nothing is perfect of course in this im perfect world, but with all their fault! the Australian Land Acts have dont much to ensure the future stability ant prosperity of this great continent, which like the rising sun, is now beginning tc throw a few straggling beams on the hort son of history, lighting it up with tho ros} tints of dawn, and foreshadowing th' dazzling effulgence which viii marl the meridian of Australia's progress. 

 Amongst the foremost to take advan tage of tho first land act was Kennie. 

 Since thc mysterious disappearance o his tourist companion, Edgar, with it: tragical surroundings, he had remaiuoc in Melbourne, shunned by his few ac quaintances, and feoling that he was sus pected of knowing moro than ha cared ti divulge of the fate of his late com 

 rade. 

 Hio missing man's father had come ove: from Sydney to seek for his son, and hi had offered a reward of �1000 for his dis covery alive or dsad. 

 It was iu vain, for though nutncroui search parties eager to obtain tho rowart scoured tho mountain ranges, not thi slightest trace could be found, and afton stay of three months in Melbourne, tin disconsolate fathor returned to his lonoli and stricken homo. 

 He had several interviews with Rennii during his visit, and though his mind wai olouded with suspicion against him a first, his sinister thoughts were gradually removed, and he left the young mat with the full conviction that he wa; perfeotly innocent of any part in his son'i disappearance. 

 Rennie solemnly assured him that ht would make it his life's task to lift thc shadow that had thus suddenly -faller across their lives, nnd darkened thc future of both, and with this assurance the old man departed, feeling that a: long as Rennie lived no effort would bo spared to solve-tho strange pro 

 blem. \\ 

 _ During tho first rush of land selection it was not necessary to go far inland for a i'suitable area, and Rennie had n bewilder 

 ing choice of good lots. . 

 Tho stigma of guilt, however, which was- attached to him by his fellow men, and which the newspapers gavo wide publicity to by -many ; insinuations, -made' him to some extent a misan 

 thrope. 

 - His gregarious' instincts had, for the time, been effaced hy (he ruthless hand of the sliinricror and tho false judgment his fellow men had formed of him, und ho �decided to withdraw as much as possible from the world, that is, as much as would bo consonant with ibis desire to unravel tho mystery of Charles l�dgar. 

 Tho mountain-peaks of Macedon . and Diogenes possessed a fascination for him, and he felt uneasy when out of sight of theso towering land marks. 

 His :pjost for laud, combined with his dosiro to avoid .the busy haunts of men; led his footstops into the'heart of the -Black-forest, and about ton milos from ^Macedon, and in full view of tho mounts, at tho source of tho Campaspe river,-ho 

 -decided to settle. 

 ? Tho locality at that time was indescrib - ably wild. Immense trees grew BO thiokly ' that in somo places tho beams of tho sun never penetrated. ..-�.-.' 

 _ In spots, patches :- had -been cleared away" by tho great whirlwind of-fire on Black Thursday, which ravaged, tho cele 

 brated forest. 

 Choppy ranges . and narrow valleys sorrated tho country like tho teeth of a saw, and left out small traoks of -fiat -land. The- Boil' -was,-howevor, excel 

 lent.-' ? 

 The1 wood cutter and the saw-miller had begun their work of subduing the forest on differont aides of Ronnie's selec tion,.but somo miles from him. 

 To wards - Woodend the. timber /was being rapidly sont to Melbourne, -whilst thai.mining districts of. Blackwood:and Daylesford . were gradually extending their - -clearings into the : primeval woods. i 

 To-day tho black forest exists - but as a legend and the ssc.no of many strange ad ventures, yet thirty years ago the axe had scarcely touched it ; so do we progressin this young and vigorous land. 

 The head of the Campaspe, which, rising in the heart of the forest, flows through the fertile districts of Oarlsrhue, Eynetou, past Bendigo,- and ovor the i northern plainB of Elmore nnd-Rochestor i into the Murray at Echuca, was a roman 

 tic and boautiful-spot. ! 

 > -Starting from a olnar spring .it in !a short distance is augmented to a peren nial stream. Flowing over a rooky bod tho water is so crystal like that the small blackfish, with which it abounds, can be plainly Been swimming around at a depth of five or B�X feet, while tho tiny-ao called trout-float, visiblo like amber specs, at oven n greater depth. . 

 Jn a distance of five miles ? from the source there areno less than" four. Water falls of: surpassing loveliness. : ': 

 At these places the . solid rock has by some means been scooped out,; probably by the washing away of soft; strata, and the never-ceasing action of the water has caused tho most curious andr: gro tesque formations. 

 Some of thom riao out of their liquid bed statue liko, as horrible and ropel lant as Chinese Gods, whilst others'as sume tho shape of diff�rent "birds ,and 

 animals. 

 In ono instance, a magnificent, rook, about ten feot high, exactly resembles a petrified Kangaroo, whilst another ia tho verisimilitude of agigantiosquattingduok; indeed, n small zoological collection in stono could bo made here. 

 Strange hollows mid bora holoa - aro worn in tho solid rock, soma of thom saucer shapod, and others perfectly round and apparently bottomless.. These are filloa with the crystal water, and toom with small fish, lt would - be a paradise for tho eel, but these serpent like fish are not found in any river north- of the Dividing Rango. 

 After running over tho vast table rock where the natural museum-of curiosities is placed, the bright water 1 alls - over a ledge of rocks a dislance of about fifteen feet, sparkling like diamonds; into a still pool below, which numerous wild fowls 

 make their haunts as abundant food ia found, and the solemn quietness of tho spot makes it still more acceptable. 

 Tho banks aro lined with the wild rasp berry, over which the wattle tree bonds, and towering �above all, those -grand old Titans of tho 'forest-the eucalypti throw out their protecting arms, tho whole forming n picture of river beauty seldom oqualled and never excelled. 

 ! The first ten miles of the-Campa&pe is a succession of scenes like this, after 

 which a remarkable change for tho worse I takes place when it runa through settle 

 ment, . and it becomes a prosaic and I

 to its estuary it is an uninviting and un 

 romantic channel. 

 The river may be taken ss an emblem of human life. Startirg out with the purity, quiet and innocence of childhood and romance of youth, which looks at the world with the bright, though delusive eyes of Hope. Contact with the reality speedily works a change for the worse. The innocence and peace of childhood dis appears before the sin and Btorms of the world, and the purity of our youth is supplanted by the turgid passions of our more mature age. 

 Tho glowing anticipations-the castles in tho air-of our early years, fade away and leave nothing but the dull and spirit less thoughts-the "might have beens," of declining age, and wo glide into the grave to mix our dust with generations who have gone before us, and who started out on the river of life with the same bright promise. 

 Hainan life has many similes. 

 Rennie had some difficulty in purauad ing himself to settle down in the wild and lonely paradise ho had selected for his 

 home. 

 Used to cheerful company, and brought up in a city, it required no slight wrench to former habits to bury himself in his 

 hermit like retreat. 

 Ho was a comparative novice to bush life, but when ho finally determined to become a free selector on the Campaspe, he went into tho work with vigor. 

 Employing a few experienced bush men, they soon cleared a tow acres and built a substantial log house, atter which they fenced in the ground, and Earnest Rennie had fairly joined the army of small settlers who were fast over-running the colony. 

 He had seven hundred pounds and ex pectations from Home, so :that he was in an immeasurably ' betterf*position than most;other selectors, who^took up lnnd with soarc'ely enough capital "tb pay the Biirvoy-fees, and Wh�""for"years after toiled like galley slavtriH'in' Abject povorty in what wns frequently!a' vain'attempt to obtain tho fee simple of the ground.

 ?soon had neighbours who frequently broke j 'in upon the privacy of his wild retreat. I
