 - ?' . ? THE Mount Macedon Mystery CHAPTER IX. � (Continued.) 

 44 Ho has told me that his stop-brother, who-has been for some years in America, V often made threats against him in hiB - passionate fits, bub he did not regard thom seriously. ' 44 Is it known if this brother really did go to America ?' he asked, looking up. 44 His father gave mo some information 

 regarding him, but he only surmised that he had sailed to America.' 'I. did; not know him,' tho .girl re turned, 'but I have heard Charles say that it was not known for certain whether ho had gone there or not. He often ex pressed a wish that ho would return. I am sure Charles had not tho slightest ill will to his step-brother.' 44 Of course tho younger son would in herit the entire fortune if tho elder wero thus repudiated.' ' I do not know in what manner Mr. Edgar proposed disposing or his fortune,' she answered ; *4 and I am sure any such motive of enriching himself at his* brother's expense never ontorod tho head of the younger one.' 'Of course not,' answered the Inspec tor, soothingly, for his visitor was begin ing to show signs of indignation at the thought of anyone imputing mercenary motives to hor late lover. '-From what I havo heard of Charles Edgar I believe him to havo been a ^ kind-hearted, excellent young man, and I hope, Miss Deroroaux, tlyifc wo will, ere long, find him alive and woll.' He said this to console the poor girl, for her wan face and wistful manners touched him. 41 God grant thnt you may,' she fervently replied, and then the lnap.ee- ! tor accompanied her to tho door, as she wished to go. 14 Lynx will be here at nine o'clock to morrow morning, and if you will giro mo your address I will send him to you.' j 44Union. Hotel, Collins-street,' she; answered; : and then departed with a I heavy lieart, for apparently the author ities wore quite in the dark regarding her lover's fate. I Next morning the detective called on j her, but ho had very little to tell. Ho was still at work on tho case, but he found it an extromoly difficult one, and . could not even get a peg to hang a theory I on aa he expressed it, Hope, which 14 springs oternal in the human brenst,' howe'ver, whispered that success would crown his efforts in tho ond, and he was sanguino that ero long he would solve the * mystery. Ho gave Miss Deveroaux instructions how to reach Mr. Ronnie's selections, but excused himself from accompanying her by saying that his prcaonce would not bo agreeable to the young man, and would look like a menace. This was palpably true, and by tho first train next day Adeline Devereaux reached Woodend, and, hiring a vehicle from the Commercial Hotel, Bet out for Campaspo in tho company of a driver who knew the district. CHAPTER X. / THB FREE SELECTOR. Victorian legislators as a rule do not stand high in tho estimation of the moro thoughtful portion' of tho community. Occasionally a demagogue rises who with glib , promises to tho masses attains a , temporary popularity not warranted by the Acts he placeB on the Statute Book, hub taking our Houses of Parliament in 'General their members have done much to deserve tho respect of tho people. , Assuredly one of the most beneficial steps that was ever taken to ensure tho prosperity of Victoria was the uyBtom of free land selection, which was inaugu rated in tho 'sixties.' Like overy other innovation its first principles, crude as thoy necessarily wore, may havo aided to swell tho already large estates which tho act was intended to prevent, but tho general result of tho new departure has been to settle on the . land a sturdy yeomanry � which, we aro toldr is tho backbone of a country. Judging by the history of France this is true, for the policy which aims at mak ing each man his own landlord tends to solve tho groat problem, exemplified in tho Irish Question, of national quietude. If the axiom that an Englishman's home is his castle be true, how muoh moro forcibly may it be applied to tho man who owns the feo airaplo of the soil . surrounding his houso. Such ownorship produces a sense of . in depondouce which cannot fail to raiso tho standard of mankind in tho country which allows such an opportunity to its inhabitants. Tho whining tone,- tho oroucliing gait and general marks of grovelling subser vience typical of the semi-paupers, in the 

 old land, who scarcoly own tho rags whioh covor thom, and who, if not par tially supported by tho pariah, nro pen sioners of noblemen or other landed magnatos, ia noticeably absent in coun tries that allow tho many, and nob the fow:to possosa the land. Nothing is perfect of courso in this im perfect world, but with all thoir faults tho Australian Land Acts havo dono much to ensuro tho future stability and prosperity of this groat continent, which, like tho rising sun, is now beginning to throw a fow straggling beams on tho hori zon of history, lighting it up wil lithe rosy tints of dawn, and foreshadowing tho , dazzling effulgence which 'vill mark | the meridian of Australia's progress. Amongst tho foremost to tako advan tage of the first land act was Ronnie. Since the mysterious disappearance of his tourist companion, Edgar, with its tragical surroundings, ho had remained in Melbourne, shunned by his few ac quaintances, and fooling that he wr.s sus pected of knowing more than ho carod to divulge of tho fato of his late com rade. Ihe missing man's father had come ovor from Sydney to seek for his son, and ho had offered a reward of �1000 for his dis covery alive or dsnd. It was in vain, for though numerous search parties oagor to obtain the reward scoured the . mountain ranges, not tho slightest traco could bo found, and after a stay of three months in Melbourne, the disconsolate father returned to his lonely aud stricken home. Ho had several interviews with Ronnie during his visit, and though his mind was clouded with suspicion against him at first, his sinister thoughts wero gradually removed, and ho left the young man with the full cor.viction that he was perfectly innocent of any part in his son's disappearance. Rennie solemnly assured him thnt he would make it his life's task to .lift the shadow that had thus suddenly fallen 1 across their lives,, nnd darkened tho future of both, and with this assurance the old man departed, feeling that as long as Rennio lived no effort would bo Bpared to solve tho strange pro blem. During tho first rush of land selection it was not necessary to go far inland for a suitable area, and Rennio had a bewilder ing choice of good lots. Tho stigma of guilt, however, which wns attached to him by his fellow mon, and which tho nowspapors gave wide publicity to by many insinuations, mado him to some extont a misan thrope. His gregarious instincts had, for tho time, been effaced by tho ruthless hand of 

 tne slanderer and tho falso judgment his fellow mon had formed of him, and ho decided to withdraw as much as possiblo from the world, that is, as much as would bo consonant with his desire to unravel the mystery of Charles Edgar. The mountain peaks of Macedon and Diogenes possessed a fascination for him, and he folb uneasy whon out of sight of these towering land marks. His quest for land, combined with his desire to avoid the busy haunts of men, led his footsteps into tho heart of the Black Forest, and about ton miles from Macedon, and in full view of the mounts, at tlio source of tho Campaspo river, ho decided to settlo. Tho locality at that time was indescrib ably wild. Immense trees grew so thickly that in soino places tho beams of the sun never penetrated. In spots, patches had beon cleared away by the groat whirlwind of firo on Black Thursday, which ravaged tho cele brated forest. Choppy ranges and narrow valleys serrated the country like tho teeth of a saw, and left out small tracks of flat land. Tho soil was, however, excel lent. The wood cutter and the saw-millor had begun their work of subduing tho forest on different Rides of Ronnie's selec tion, but somo miles from him. Towards Woodend tho timber was boing rapidly sont to Melbourne, whilst the mining districts of Blackwood aud Daylesford were gradually extending their clearings ? into the primeval woods. To-day tho black foresb exists but as a legend and the S'jene of many strange ad ventures, yet thirty years ago tho axe had scarcoly touched it ; so do we progrosa in this young and vigorous land. Tlie head of tho Campaspe, which, rising in the heart of the forest, flows through the fertile districts of Carlsrhuo, Kyneton, past Bendigo, and over the northern plains of Elmore and Rochester into the Murray at Echuca, was a roman tic and beautiful spot. Starting from a clear spring it in a short distance is augmented to a peren nial stream. Flowing over a rocky bed tho water is so crystal like that tho small black fish, with which it abounds, oan be plainly seen swimming around at a depth of five or six feot, while tho tiny� so called trout � float, visible like amber specs, at oven a greater depth. In a distance of five miles from the source thero are no less than four water falls of surpassing loveliness. At these placeB the solid rock has by some means been scooped out, probably by tho washing away of soft strata, and the never-ceasing action of the wator has caused tho most curious and gro tesque formations. Somo of them rise out of thoir liquid bed statue liko, as horriblo and repel Iant as Chinese Gods, whilst , others as Buuio tho Bhapo of different birds and animals. In one instance, a magnificent rock, about ten foot high, exactly resembles a petrified Kangaroo, whilst anothor is the verisimilitude of a gigantic squatting duck; indeed, a small zoological collection in stone could bo mado here. Strange hollows and bore holes are ?worn in the solid rock, somo of thom saucor shaped, and others perfectly round and apparently bottomless. These are filloct with the crystal water, and teem with small fish. It would be a paradise for the eel, but these serpent liko fish aro not found in any river north of the Dividing Rango. After running ovor the vast tablo rock whore tho natural museum of curiosities is placed, tho bright water falls ovor a ledgo of rocks a distance of about fifteen foat, sparkling like diamonds, into a still pool below, which numerous wild fotyle make their haunts qb abundant food is found, and the solemn quietness of the spot makes it still more acceptable. Tho banks aro lined with tho wild rasp berry, oyer which the wattle troo bends, and towering above all, thoso grand old Titans of tho forest� the eucalypti throw out^ their protecting armB, tho whole forming a picture of rivor beauty seldom equalled and never oxcolled. The first ten milos of tho Campaspe is a . succession of - scenes liko this, aftor whioh a remarkable chango for tho worse takes placo when it runs through settle ment, and ib becomes a prosaic and muddy beaten course, From near Bendigo 

 to its estuary it is an uninviting and un* romantic channel. Tho river may bo taken as nn emblem of human life. Starting out with tho purity, quiet and innoccnco of childhood and romanco of youth, which looks at tho world -with tho bright, though delusive eyes of Hope. Contact with tho reality 5-peedilv works a chango for tho worse. Tlio itinocenco and peaco of childhood dis appears beforo the sin and storms of tho world, and tho purity of our youth is supplanted by the turgid passions of our moro mature age. Tho glowing anticipations� tho castlos in tho air � of our oarly yonra,*fndc away and leave nothing but tho dull and spirit less thoughts � tho 41 might have boons,' of declining age, and wo glide into tho gravo to mix our dust with generations who havo gono before us, and who started out on the river of lifo with tho samo bright promise. Human lifo has many similes. Rennio had como difficulty in pursuad ing himself to settlo down in tho wild and lonely paradise lie had selected for his homo. Used to cheerful company, andbrought up in a city, it required no slight wrench to former habits to bury himself in his hermit liko retreat. He was a comparative novico to bush life, but whon lie finally determined to beconio a free selector on the Campnspe, he went into tho work with vigor. Employing a few experienced bush men, they soon cleared a fow acres and built a substantial Jog. house, after which they fenced iti the ground, and Earnest Rennio had fairly joined tho army of s.mnll settlers who were fast over-running tho colony. IIo hnd sevon hundred pounds* and ex pectations from Homo, so that he was in an immeasurably better position than most other selectors, who took up land with scarcely enough capital to pay'tho survey foes, and who for years after toiled liko galley slaves in abject poverty in what was frequently a vain attempt to obtain tho fee simplo of tho ground. Mon liko Rennie who had capital ulti mately bought out such struggling peoplo, and increased their original small hold ings to dimensions which were amplo to combine grazing with agricultural pur suits. Within twolve months of Ronnie's settlement' ab the head of the Campaspo, nearly the whole of tho land along tho river had been pegged out and applied for by various people, so that tho pioneer soon had neighbours who frequently broke in upon tho privacy of his wild retreat, CHAPTER XI. ressie's iio.uk. It waB a rough journey through a wild country which Miss Devereaux had to travel in order to reach Ronnie's new home. Tho sound of crashing trees falling beforo tho woodman's axe broke upon tho oar, and in ovory direction the remains of stately eucalypti, with a small portion only, of the trunk tuken away for use, wore lying around. The waste of fine timber wnB almost be yond conception, and it induced a bitter Nemesis soon after; for the vast quantity of fallen timber, when it became dry, took fire, and swept away many homes and tho fruits of much labor. Although distant from Woodend only seven miles, it occupied fully two hours to reach Ronnie's clearing.. Thero was no road, save the tracks mado by the wood carters which led nowhere in particular, and tho steep ranges wore not easily sur mounted. It was mid-day when thoy reaohed their destination, and as thoy stopped for a moment on the top of a high range, overlooking tho head of the Campaspe, Miss Deverfinux was surprised to see the change that had been wrought on Rennio's selection. A spaco of fully a hundred acres had been cleared during tho short time the occupant had been in possession, nnd a number of mon with teams of bullocks wore still buBily engaged in the work, A rough, though substantial houso stood on a slight omincnco in the middle of tlio clearing, and several other smaller erections wero visible a short distance further on. Towards tho main building the driver .went, and aa they tieared it a thoughtful, sad-eyed man came out to meet thorn with a cordial welcomo. As ho looked at the lady his face grow a shade paler, for ho at onco recognised her as Miss Devereaux, though she ap peared years older than tho eight months since ho had scon her .would warrant. Hs easily guessed the reason. 44Mr, Rennie,' siio said, leaping out of tho vehicle,' I am glad to see you again,' and sho wont towards him with extended hand. Hor kind greeting reassured him, for he had expected reproachful glances and bitter words from tho girl whoso lover he was tho moans of bringing to Victoria away from her side. 44 1 am sincerely glad to see yonv Miss Devereaux. If I had known of your in tended visit I would have met you at the station and brought you over. It is a rough road.' With all his old grace he invited her inside, and she found tho interior much more comfortable than she expected. 44 1 havo two married men working for mo,' ho explained. 44 Their wives and families live in yonder cottages, and tho women look aftor my poor house and do the cocking. So you see 1 am not such a hermit as you might think.' Jusv. then ono of tho women came into the room, and Ronnie introduced her as Mrs. Affleck, and requested her to wait on Miss Devoreaux whilo bIio remained with them. Tho young lady expressed hor intention of returning to Woodend during tho course of the aftornoon, but Rennio begged her not to go until, nt leaBt, tho following day. 44 We can make you quite comfortable horo, I assuro you,' ho urged, 44 and you will find a few days' chango in tho bush quito a relief from tho bustle and worry of city life. Besides, you must be tired out. She was nob anxious to leave, and was easily persuaded to remain. Mrs. Affleck /was a good, motherly woman, and Adeline wag soon quito at homo with her. Aftor changing hor dress and partaking of a plain bub wholesome meal, Miss Devereaux accepted Rennio's invitation to view tho clearing operations. Backed up with tho neodful money, the young selector had certainly worked wonders in the primeval forest, and was rapidly making a comfortable home. As they walked around, the thought' which was uppermost in their minds found vent. 44 My dear friend,' Rennio said, turn* ing to the younggirl, and speaking in a low voioo, 44 1 Know you have come to this colony in search of your promised husband, and my beBb friend, Charles Edgar. ' His strange disappearance has thrown 

 a shadow ovor both our lives. I know it has been a fearful blow to you, and lo mo it jK'ems like a awful droam, from which I shall awako and find that I have been indeed dreaming, and seo you and Charlos Edgar passing through life hand in hand together. I havo beon almost hunted from my fellow-men by a foul and unjust suspicion, but I felt rewarded to-day for all I havo Buffered when you claspod my hand and I read in your face my inno eonco proclaimed thoro.' 44 Never for ono moment,' sym* pathetically answered tho young girl, 44 did I think you were to blamo for Charley's disappearance. I know that you had a gonuiuo affoction for him, and if I can read charactor at all, I bolievo you would not stoop to a moan and ignoble action, much loss to ombruo your haiuh in innocent blood. 41 No. Mr. Rennio,' do not let us over talk of such an absurd suspicion. But as wo are both interested � deeply interested � I claim your tielp in clearing tho mystery up. As sure as tho sun shines in the heavens, if a foul crimo has boon committed, justice, though tardy, will overtake iho criminal, and if not, wo must only trust in an over-ruling Pro vidence to show us light where now all is darkness. I havo dedicated my life to that ono purpose, and I shall nevor rest content until I know the fate of Charles Edgar.' Sho spoke in such a determined voice that her companion could not help looking at her. Tho flashing eyes and heaving breast bore eloquent testimony to the excite ment under which sho labored. 44 Our mission in life is the same,' an swered the young man, 44 for I havo mado .a vow never to miss an opportunity of lifting the dark veil which enshrouds tho fate of Mr. Edgar. 44 Possessed with that idea,' ho went on, 44 1 could not live out of sight of the last place I saw my' friend. There. 'nnd ho pointed iu an eastorly direction, as tho shuddering girl looked, . 44 h tho Camels Hump, the second peak from horo. On thnt ill-fated mount I stood with your affianced husband not quito a year ngo, when the fatal mist came on and hul him fromview. Strangely as he vanished,! yet believe I fchall hear of him agiin, and every scrap of information thafl can ob tain from pioneers of the mount I treasure up for fuluro use. I have been told of a BJrange old woman who lives alone in the' wildcat part of these ranges, and 1 in tend to visit her shortly and seo if sho oan furnish mo with any clue.' 44 It was stated in the papers that an other man named Marshall, a member of a survey party, was lost on that fatal peak the same day as Charies. Did you bee a third person on the summit?' sho asked. 44 No ; and wo rested for an hour under the landmark or trigonometrical station whioh this man wns sent to inspect. I do not think he could have been on (lie mount when wo were, because at first there was no fog, and tho area is so small that we must have met. Besides, a fow minutes beforo tho fog enveloped us, Edgar fired at a goat, and tho discharge of tho gun reverberated amongst tho rocks with a noise liko thunder, which must surely have attracted attention in that lonely spot.' Talking in this manner about the lost one they both loved so dearly, tho young peoplo slowly returned to tho house. Thoy both felt happier, for th?y had opened their hearts and shared their sor rows and their hopes with each other. Thoy were both of the samo purpose, re garding thoir future action towards tho missing man. Tho power of human sympathy is as tonishing, for that evening Adeline Devereaux and Ernest Rennio, conscious of a mutual sympathy with oach other's griefs, passed tho hours far happier than they had dono sinco the young man spont that terrible night alone in tho damp cave on the 44 Camel's Hump.' Adeline told him anything of interest that had transpired in Sydnoy, and Rennio was deeply affectcd as he pic tured to himself tlio childless couple at Parramatta, who, instead of receiving tho blessings of happiness in their old age, wero tottering to tho gravo under an afflicting load of sorrow � tho first born driven from the -door liko a pariah, and tho fate of tho younger wrapped in a dark and impenetrable pall of mystery. It was nearly midnight � a rather late hour for bush settlers � when Miss Dovereaux rotirod with Mrs. Affleck, and as sho lay in bed thinking ovor the events of tho day, sho felt, with a slight thrill of pleasure, that alio was not quito alono in tho world so long as Ernest Rennio lived. For the first time in many months she fell into a peaceful And refreshing slumber, undisturbed by dreams of dizzy precipices or murdered men, and when alio awoke tho suu was brightly streaming through the window, and tho sounds of lifo outsido told her that tlio curtiin of another day was lifted, and the human actors were about to play their parts. CHAPTER XII. ' TUB SUN -WILL RISE AGAIN TO-MORROW. The days passed swiftly to MiBB Devereaux in tho new life she led in tho wild Black Forest on Ronnie's selec tion. Tho visit of a day had lengthened into a week, and still sho was loth to go, and her young host was most importunate in his requests for her to remain. 44 If you will dp me the favor to stay for another week I will go to. Melbourne with you,' ho said. 44 1 havo a slight cluo, of perhaps no importance, that I wish to give tho detectives, and if it docs nothing else ib may spur them on to re nowed exertions.' lie gave tho girl an evasive answer as to what the cluo was, for if thoro was any truth in the story ho hoard it pointed to fact that Charles Edgar must havo been murdered. It was only a tap-room yarn. In talk ing with one of his original employes about tho affair which had created such a Bensation, tho old follow, who was fond of his grog whon noar a shanty, recollected that about tho time it happened, a weary looking, restless man came into tho bar of tlio Hanging Rock hotel, noar Woodend, and indulged very freely in whisky. Ib waa not long before he got drunk, and be gan to behave like a madman. The land lord tried to quioten him, but hiB ap proaches woro met in the most bellicose manner. Aftor a timo the drunken follow Bud- 1 donly calmed down, and going towards i tho peacemaker, looked fixedly at him for a few moments, and then slowly said, with a strangely wild glitter in his eyes : 44 Look hero, you scoundrel.- If you daro to cross mo -in my purpose I will fling you over a cliff as I did my enemy yester day; aye, down, down to hell I'll send you.'�fSPb continued) If if 4
