 VOLUME II. CHAPTER II.�RIDING DOWN. 

 There is a picture hanging in the small but tasteful gallery of an old country house near Folkestone, the memory of which, when once gazed on, does not soon leave the gazer. It never has done so with me. How many years have passed, since, tired and flushed with long summer walking, I sat on a 

 cushioned lounge and feasted my eyes on that picture, I scarcely care to think. But many or few, stormy or placid, as may have been the � gliding years," I can shut my eyes now and see that picture as vividly as ever. Who painted it I cannot say. The people of the house could, I think, but seemed very little inclined to tell. Possibly the picture had been the work of a black sheep of the family�there are always one or two, even in the most respect- able folds. But whoever had painted it had used the brush with no unpractised hand. An oil painting, with tints and colours that drew praise from many an artist gazer. " Riding Down." So I named the picture, and others after me called it the same. A deep green-carpeted, fern-clothed dell, even the hot noonday sun scarce able to send its rays through the interlaced over- arching foliage of the lofty trees. Bramble- bushes growing so closely together as to leave barely room for passage ; birds singing ; a little brook babbling on its way through the thyme- scented grass ; wild flowers, shade, and rest. A place to fling oneself down in after a hot weary walk, and with half-shut eyes, dream of which- ever is the pleasanter, the past, or the future. A place, the memory of which in a hot room on a hot day, would be almost maddening in its tanta- lising force. And yet a place with every beauty marred by the concomitant human figures. Nature beautiful, earth and sky uniting in the offer of rest and shade, and man disfiguring all. Crouching down among the fern and brambles, a knot of some ten or twelve ill-favoured men in ill- favoured armour, with swords and halberds clutched in hands ready to use them. Soiled doublets under rusty hacquetons, battered morions, rough boots drawn up to the thigh. A very unsatisfactory group indeed. In the background a horse, his nostrils care- fully held by a man better armed than the others, the open vizor showing the remains of a hand- some face, golden spurs on the heels, the leader of the condottieri. All eagerly watching a narrow strip of white road winding through the dell. Watching more eagerly than all, a young girl, every feature of her beautiful face immobile and fixed in anxiety. None of all that wicked, fear- less band more on the watch than she. So much for the foreground. In the back, from under the trees on the brow of the hill, comes the waited-for � " riding down" into the dell � to his death. The helmet hanging at the saddle-bow, the velvet-feathered bonnet placed jauntily on the curled locks, the sword dangling carelessly in the scabbard, the easily held reins, the careless grace of the whole figure betoken confidence and security. Glance again at the foreground and you will e e that the leader, though carefully holding his horse so as to check a warning neigh, has his eyes fiercely bent upon the lady, with an expression of mocking triumph. Easy indeed to suppose the story. Wife or daughter, let it be wife for the nonce, she has given a meeting to the careless riding cavalier, her husband has intercepted the letter, and on the road to the rendezvous has posted his men, ready to do the worst he can order them � bringing her, too, with a devilish cruelty, so that eyes which thought to look on features glowing with love may gaze upon them cold in death. In the mind of the approaching horseman, there is not the faintest suspicion, and so paralysed is the unhappy cause that she cannot even raise a warning cry to save a life for which she would readily have given her own. A few more moments, a few more paces of the good steed " riding down," and there will be a rush, angry oaths, a war cry uttered with the recklessness of despair, a useless, hopeless struggle, three or four good blows, a broken sword, a bleeding figure reeling to the ground, its fair locks dabbled with blood, the rapid sound of horse galloping away in the distance, a female form vainly struggling in the strong arms that hold her, a fierce voice bidding her to look on what the armed foot spurns contemptuously, men wiping swords and halberds, wild flowers trodden down and blood-stained, all the beauty of the picture gone, the realisation of what the careless, loving young knight had all unconsciously "ridden down" to meet. And ever thus, even as in that unforgotten pic- ture, have I seen men ride down the dell of cir- cumstances to meet their fate, into the jaws of the Unexpected, sometimes to kisses and happiness, often to sword blows and misery. And thus, too, 

 on that wet, gusty morning when Charles Ashton mysteriously declined to be introduced to the gentlemanly officer in charge of the escort, there came riding down a winding road, about fifteen miles from the hotel where the accommo- dation was so scanty, a figure that would have made any road pleasant. A young girl, about eighteen; with fair hair gathered up under a broad-brimmed straw hat, and a dark green riding-habit fitting closely to a shapely figure. To a real admirer of beauty feminine there is nothing attractive in the spectacle of a woman with flushed face and streaming hair, dashing wildly along on the skirts of a pack, with one- half of her habit flying in the wind, and the other fluttering from the top of a bullfincher, a signal of distress. It may be very nice to read about in a sporting story, but it is fearfully unwomanly, and the only thing femininely attractive about Whyte Melville's Miss Merlin is the womanly tinge that shows out from the harsher colouring of her nature, as she stands under the hot southern sun by the grave of her dead lover. But a girl who can sit squarely in her saddle as her horse canters easily and lightly handled along a forest road, the long skirt floating grace- fully in the wind, and the light body showing the graceful swaying of a lithe figure, is a sight even a misogynist would view with pleasure. Just such a fair English girl cantered along that bush road on that same Australian win- ter morning. The rain that had come down so fiercely in the early morning had ceased, as if out of complaisance for so fair a tra- veller; and though at every stride along the muddy path the skirt became more and more stained, the weather seemed to have as little effect upon the rider as upon the steed. Evidently a pet in the family she belonged to was this girl, for her horse, both in breed and grooming, would not have disgraced the Lady's Mile. Under the light hand that held the rein the good steed cantered gracefully along, evidently proud of his burden, and the roughly clad station groom behind seemed as satisfied with his position, as if, clad in immacu- late frock, snowy breeches, and undeniable tops, he were trotting behind a fashionable beauty down the Row. A fairer mistress certainly no London groom could have ridden after. From under the broad brim of the straw hat, gentle, kindly blue eyes beamed pleasantly ; the fair com- plexion, flushed with the fresh air and rapid motion, would have made a season-worn belle en- vious that to produce such a colour cosmetiques were valueless ; and from between the smilingly parted lips, as the horse's arched neck was patted with encouraging words, shone two rows of glis- tening tiny teeth. Good fifteen miles of that rain-soaked road had been ridden over since the start from the home station, and yet horse and rider looked com- paratively as fresh as if the ride had been a mere pacing on the turf. Even the groom, a man whose stockwhip had been cracked among the thickest timber of the ranges, and whose name as a " cutter out" of station cattle was renowned in the district, looked more dissatisfied with road and weather than his mistress. On such a day as the morning which had drawn down expres- sions of disgust from Charles Ashton, few, even bush young ladies would have cared to tempt the road, and sit with the same smile upon the fair face, and the same kindly beam in the soft blue eyes. That graceful figure in the dark-green habit rode carelessly down the road to a fate she had never thought of. Bound on an errand of mercy and charity, such as women are so ready to ride on, she had left the home station early on that winter's morning to speak words of comfort that were eagerly longed for. Ah, yes, ye English wives, mothers, and 

 daughters. Ye gentle ministering angels, who, from the times of chivalry down to the death- dealing days of the Crimea, have held Mar- mion's dying head, and tenderly nursed the rough dragoon � not Jael-like, to drive the nail into the sleeping warrior's temple � but to comfort and to cure. We have not lost you even in this far land of the South, as many a lonely shepherd or sick station hand could tell. Ye are wayward, exact- ing, "hard to please," but when the time comes, and "sickness" or sorrow bows us down to the grave, are as good as the gold Australia gives her chil- dren. We love you, we are alternately your slaves and your tyrants ; you work us immeasurable harm as well as good, but the worst of us will not deny that by the sick bed or in the day of trouble you are as the fountain that bubbled up among that sand-surrounded oasis in the desert. We have toiled and struggled through the hot weary day, our eyes are half blind with the cruel glare of the pitiless sun, the glowing armour bears us down like the casing of a furnace, the penetrating sand is crusted smartingly on our faces, and so utterly worn and weary we fling ourselves at your feet, bless you, and are thankful. "How far is it now, Sam ?" asked the young lady, checking her horse as they reached a spot where a narrow track turned off into the bush. " About four miles, Miss Lucy," said the man, touching his cabbage-tree, " But we shall have to go slowly. If I were you, Miss, I should wait there a little. Mr. John said something about calling at the hut on his way back, when I told him that Bill was getting worse." "Perhaps it would be better, Sam. I hope you haven't broken that bottle of wine, for it's nearly the last in the house, and you know how long the drays have been away." Sam had not broken the bottle, which he pro- duced from an under pocket of his pea jacket, and turning their horses off the road, mistress and groom rode away among the tall green trees. " It's very good of you, Ashton, to take com- passion on a poor devil's comparative isolation, and come with me. Beast of a road, isn't it ? Hold up, old lady. One consolation, the rain has left off, and seems likely to hold off. We have got a long way to go, but I can give you a better welcome at Lal Lal than old Wilson seemed likely to do. It's not such an uncomfortable crib either since my sister came up." John Herbert had succeeded in persuading Charles Ashton to visit his station, and they were driving in a serviceable though not over-hand- some dog-cart towards the locality in question. The young squatter had found his shipmate after the escort had left, sauntering, a pipe in his mouth, along the banks of the rocky creek that in winter swept through a dell at the back of the hotel. A set expression of face, and a stern look about the eyes, showed that the reverie was not an agreeable one, but with instinctive good-breed- ing Herbert asked no questions, and merely re- peated his invitation to the station. When in the hotel, the young man he asked to his house had thought of refusing, but the sight of the 

 escort officer and subsequent reflection had made him change his mind, and accept thankfully. Mr. Herbert's dogcar had been accordingly or- dered out, a final drink in the way of brandy-hot had been consumed, and both gentlemen were being carried as rapidly as the deteriorated state of an ori- inall yatrocious bush road would permit. For some time, too, the drive had been in silence, for Ash- ton's mind was evidently busy with the memories of a past of which his host knew nothings but after the first mile or so had been done Ashton had said suddenly, � " Dare say you think it odd, Herbert, I didn't want to be introduced to Captain Barrington but it's just as well you should hear as much as I can , tell you of the truth. I am neither a bolting bank director nor a forger, with the results of my guilt in my pocket, but I left home without the know- ledge of my relations, and entirely on my own hook, as they say here. Through the kindness of a man I knew slightly in London I got a letter of introduction to the Governor here, telling him some of the circumstances of my case, but I never presented it, and don't care to. I am sick of home and all connected with it, and intend to carve out a future for myself. Does that satisfy you? I hope it does, for I like you." " So do I you," had been Mr. Herbert's reply, " and if I weren't satisfied I shouldn't have asked you to my house. I knew you to be a gentleman from your conduct on board ship, the few persons you know in Melbourne all speak well of you, and if you can get on without help from relatives, so much the better. It's Charles Ashton I want to know, not his people. Now I think we can drop that part of the subject." Such was Mr. Ashton's opinion also, and the subject had been dropped accordingly. " How long did you say you had been out here, Herbert ?" asked Ashton, as the former concluded his remark about a welcome, with an emphatic benediction on an unusually deep mud-hole that nearly sent the dog-cart over. "Three years before the diggings showed out; but Lucy has been most of the time in Melbourne with the Grantley's. Do you know them ?" " No." " Well, it's no great loss, although they are a sort of connection of ours. Mrs. Grantley was kind though to Lucy while I was in England, so, perhaps, I ought not to run them down, but it has always struck me that if I were John Herbert, of nowhere, instead of Lal Lal station, Lucy's welcome would not be quite so warm. Hold up again, old silly. Never saw such a stupid mare in all my life, Ashton ; she's always trying to rub her nose against stumps." " Do you like the place, Herbert ?" asked Ash- ton. " Well, it isn't as good as Oxley Park ; nor is Collins street like Regent street, but one might do worse. There's plenty of fun here sometimes. Lively enough, too, since the diggings started.", " Does Miss Herbert like it ?" " Why, yes ; Lucy likes the place very well in- deed," said Herbert, dexterously dodging his head as they passed suddenly under a low branch. " Look out, old fellow, or you'll be made into a bush Absalom before you know where you are. That's it, always mind your head in the bush. Oh, yes ; Lucy likes the place tremendously. You see, she's a sort of Lady Bountiful here. Even when she was a little chit of fourteen, and while my father was alive, she used to be every- thing in the village. Our poor mother," went on the speaker, his cheery voice drooping, and his careless expression becoming sad, " was never much of a parson's wife in the matter of visiting. Besides, poor thing, she was too delicate ; and so Miss Lucy used to trot about like a little Red Riding Hood to all the grannies in the place, and she does the same sort of thing here among the station hands. I really believe they would do a 

 great deal more for her than for me." " Your parents died before you came here ?" said Ashton. " Pardon me asking the ques- tion, but I am so much alone out here that you and yours interest me." " Thanks," replied Herbert, looking kindly at his companion. " Yes, we were left orphans six months before I came out here. My mother died first, and my father soon followed her. It had been a love match, Ashton ; and if ever two loved on to the end, they did. And so when we were alone I couldn't bear the place, and I brought Lucy and my �5,000 out here. I try to do my duty by her, old fellow, and, by Jove, she de- serves it. Times have gone well, too, since the diggings, and, if the luck lasts, my pretty Lucy, God bless her� there you go again, you timber- legged beast � will not be a penniless bride. Hallo ! old fellow ; what's the matter ? Beg par- don for the remark, but ain't you well ? You look very pale." " Quite well," was the reply, " Dare say you'll think me an idiot, Herbert; but I am really grateful for your kindness to a lonely s' ranger. I was thinking of my mother. I have been an orphan since I was a child." " She died young then ?" asked Herbert softly. " Yes, and so did my father. My early life was one first of severity and trouble, and after- wards of luxury and misery. I have no relations now ; no purpose in life, except one, and that almost beyond hope. We won't talk any more about it. It's all over now, however, and I beg your pardon for bothering you with my griefs. I am not likely to be a social bore, moreover, for, besides you, I don't think I have a friend here." The voice fell so low, and the handsome features grew so clouded as the last words were uttered, that Mr. John Herbert suddenly requested his companion to take the reins, and then, after giving him an encouraging slap on the back; pro- ceeded to cut tobacco, fiercely humming a verse of the 'Ratcatcher's Daughter,' very much out of tune, and in a strangely husky voice. " Keep her on her legs, Ashton, while I load my pipe, and then we'll shove along. The road's a little better for the next four miles or so, and it's well to make hay while the sun shines." "Does it ever shine here?" asked Ashton, handing over the reins and loading his own pipe with Cavendish offered him. " It don't look like it." " Oh ! but it does though. You come up here about January, and you'll find a difference. Dust nearly a foot deep, wind blowing like a blast from a furnace, and the bush burning away for miles around. By Jove, I've seen the ranges looking like an illuminated city or Martin'g pandemo- nium " "Does the fire ever do much damage ?" " Rather. There are a good few here who can remember, some three years ago, a day called Black Thursday, when stations, sheep, and men were burnt up in all directions. Poor Cummings, in the Western District, was ruined by it. A bush fire is a ticklish thing, I can tell you, espe- cially when there is no insurance. I have been very lucky hitherto, but I had a stack burnt last season, and I intend to make some arrangement 

 with the insurance people before the next season comes on. It wouldn't do to risk Lucy's fortune, you know." Mr. John Herbert was so evidently a thoroughly genuine good fellow that the young adventurer thought himself more and more fortunate in such a friend in a strange land. "Is Miss Herbert like you ? I don't mean to ask rude questions, but I hope she is," he said, almost stammering." "Like me! About as much like me as a"Rose of the Garden' is like a beer barrel. It's bad taste, I believe, top praise one's sister, but Lucy Herbert, sister to this happy owner of such a sister, is the prettiest, sweetest, best little girl that ever put on a riding habit. Not a bit of an Amazon old fellow ; don't think the dear girl could sit a buck-jumper even if I were to let her try, but she can ride like an English girl ought to ride, and he'll be a happy man who gets her, and I, why I�there you go again you blundering beast �shall be dashed miserable when she goes. You shall see her for yourself, my boy, and then you'll see that John Herbert has some reason for being such a snob as to praise his own sister. Ah, if Lucy Ashton of Lammermuir had been like my Lucy, there isn't a brother who could have bullied her if fifty mothers had put him up to it. I don't want to boast, Ashton, but if putting this cavendish-cut- ting pipe-loading hand into the fire would save Lucy a moment's mental or bodily pain I'd do it as readily as twenty Sc�volas, and take old Porsenna with the other hand afterwards. If you knew what it was when you came home wet and tired after a day on the run, to hear a sister's voice welcoming you, or sometimes even to see her 'ride down' to meet you, : you'd understand the enthusiasm, and for the moment not hit even this fiddle-head brute for taking advantage of my holding forth to go nearly on to her knees again. She ought to be shot, but Lucy won't have it." Mr. Ashton appeared thoroughly to understand the enthusiasm, but said nothing, and the cloud on his face came back again. Had he, perhaps; ever heard of such love for a sister before, such evidently denying, unselfish love ? " Hulloa " cried Herbert suddenly, as they narrowly escaped a smash into a log, "why there's Sam," and he pointed, with his whip as he spoke to a horseman coming slowly towards them. "Now then, Sam," he shouted, as the man came nearer, " What are you doing here?'' " Why, sir," said the man, riding up, " after you left, Bill came in from the knobby-tree hut, where he and Gentleman Jack have been splitting together, to say that the 'gentleman' was getting worse, and that he had asked to see Miss Lucy, and so she told me to saddle Black Prince, and off we went. She's there now, and sent me down to say, if I met you, she'd wait till you came." " Now, that's just like Lucy, Ashton," said Herbert," putting his pipe carefully into his pocket. She'd ride miles to read to a sick man, even if he is a sweep." " She would so," testified Sam, with colonial emphasis. "She has done Gentleman Jack good, too, sir. Bill says he has been quieter to-day than he has been for months." "Has he been drinking, Sam ?" asked Herbert, turning the horse off the road, and following his servant along a narrower track leading off into the thick timber that bordered "Yes, sir, on the burst for the last fortnight. Dr. Curtis saw him yesterday, and said this bout would finish him. Think it will, sir, though I didn't like to tell Miss Lucy so. I heard the poor fellow ask to be alone with her. I think he's telling her something about some lady at home, sir. I saw him looking, very hard at the shelf over his bunk just as she came in, and so I handed him down what he was looking at. I didn't look closely, of course, sir, but it was a picture of some sort." Stockwhip cracking, loose-living, hard-swearing Sam, you are not by any means one of the elect, but there be many sick-bed visitants without half your delicacy. You would "shake" a silk pocket handkerchief for a " cracker" but you wouldn't pry into a dying man's secret. " Who is this Gentleman Jack ," asked Ashton, as the dog-cart toiled slowly along the track. " Well, all I know of him myself," replied Her- bert, " is that he is a man who has evidently been a gentleman, and has taken contract with me for fencing. I know too, that he is a ticket-of- leave man, and about that I have heard rather a queer story. It's a great pity, for even now you can see what the man has been." "What is the story ?" said Ashton, and even Sam checked his horse. Gentleman Jack had clearly been talked about at the home station. I " All I have heard," continued Herbert, '' is that the poor fellow was once in some cavalry regiment, and was transported for forging a bro- ther officer's name. He came out to Sydney, served his time in a sort of sullen stupor ; but as soon as he was out 'stuck up', the Yass mail in a manner that could only be described as madly reck- less. For this offence he was again sentenced, but before six months elapsed some fellow at home died, and confessed that the forgery case was a regular plant, got up to prevent a match be- tween this man and some girl with money to whom he was engaged. Great sympathy was felt for the poor fellow, and a memorial was got up for him, but as he had beyond a doubt committed the second offence all that could be done was in the way of remission. Everybody was sorry, and out and walk directly, Ashton � but all they could do was to give the poor fellow a ticket-of leave. He found his way down here, and the police of the district, to whom he has to report himself monthly, say that, except drink, which he does fearfully, he is perfectly harmless. I am sorry for him, and Lucy cried bitterly when I told her the story. Jump out now, we shall have to walk the rest. Stay here with the horse Sam." In his inmost heart Sam would probably have liked to see the mystery out, but with the indif- ference of a true bushman he said nothing, and after preparations for a fresh smoke, remained contentedly behind. * * * "You are kind indeed, Miss Herbert," said a low voice, as Herbert and Ashton entered the inner room of the splitter's hut. And then, for the first time the latter saw the girl who, in all Christian charity, had ridden down that morn- ing to meet her fate. "You are kind, and gentle, and good, as you have always been, as you can;t help being. Jack Vincent is a drunken, worthless dog, but he be- lieves all you have read to him, and if he should care enough for anything to pray again your name will be the Iast on his lips." He is coming up to the house, and we can talk on 

 the way. Now what is to be done for this poor fellow." "He is dying, I am afraid, John," replied the young lady, who had frankly shaken hands with Ashton, and then returned to her brother. "His is such a sad story, John. He was very bad when I first came, but he is quieter now. Dr. Curtis left just before you came. He says he can't last long. Ah, John dear, perhaps it is better as it is. Look at the poor fellow." Poor fellow indeed. In years the dying man could not have been more than forty, but the face lying back on the rude pillow was a very defaced imsge of the original divinity. The hair that had been dark and wavy was thickly sprinkled with grey. Cheek and brow were deeply lined ; the high, well-shaped nose stood out with ghastly prominence; and the dark eyes were sunken deeply under the still handsome eyebrows. At some period, not so long ago, Gentleman Jack must have been a very handsome man, and now he was dying on a bush stretcher in a splitter's hut, half innocent. and half guilty perhaps, but an utter ruin of what might have been a stately edifice. `"Can I do nothing for you, Jack?" asked Her- bert, coming to the bed-side. The large dark eyes momentarily closed� opened, and looked in the younger squatter's face "Most strangers call me Mr. Vincent," said the sick man, "but you Mr. Herbert, are a gentle- man, and I am proud to know you. You've heard my story, I think. I was innocent at first, you know, but a nice mess they have made of Jack Vincent of the Carbineers. But, halloa, who is this?" As the dying man spoke he raised himself on his elbow, and a glow of some old sparkle came into his eyes. "I am a nice figure, ain't I, Morty ? Maudesly always said I should come to grief after I told him about your marriage." "What does he mean?" asked Herbert of Ash- ton, on whose face � now grown paler� the dying man was gazing. "What are you thinking of now, my poor fellow. This gentleman's name is Ashton, and he is a friend of mine going to the station. Lie downs again, there's a good fellow. The doctor said you must be kept quiet." " I am thinking of a scene that took place a long while ago, Mr. Herbert," said the dying man. Of a room in the Palais Royal, and a man cursing me for bad news l brought. Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr: Ashton, but you see as like Morty Charlton, just before he married L( pretty Lucy Pearson, as one man can be to another. More like Maudesly though when you look like that. Ah ! he was a bitter one,Mad Maudesly. Wonder if he is alive still. Nice death his will be." " He is wandering, governor," said the man's mate, looking in. at the door. " Was talking about Paris and Charltons all night. He'll be quieter directly, Miss." "Right you are, Bill," said the sick man, his voice assuming a momentary coarseness, with a sharp but sad smile. " What have I, a poor miser- able splitter, to do with Charlton and Paris. I have been a gentleman though, and beg to thank Miss Herbert like a gentleman for behaving like a lady. Much obliged, too, to Mr. Herbert. Glad to see you Mr. Ashton. Sorry I can't offer you anything. You won't forget that letter, Miss Herbert. I don't think her husband will object to her reading it now. A few lines from a poor devil like me would be too slight even for him. You'll find some other things, too; in a little parcel here"� he pointed feebly to his heart. "I should like to take them with me. 'Excuse me, gentlemen, but if Miss Herbert would just say those words again; she knows what I mean." He stopped suddenly as he spoke, and then while the three men stood with reverently bowed heads, the soft gentle voice read out, quivering with emotion�" Verily there more joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth�" " That's it," said the man, feebly trying to raise his head'. That's just it. There's the true metal there. A gentleman can only say he is sorry, and then � then � a gentleman either forgives him� or takes satisfaction without making any fuss about it. Don't forget the��not guilty, sir�I said so 

 all along � Ah, Caroline !�" 

 With gentle violence Herbert led his sister from the hut, but ere she had crossed the threshold poor Jack Vincent's ticket had been vis�d for that district where human verdicts and human sen- tences are valueless.
