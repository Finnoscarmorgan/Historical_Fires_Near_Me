CHAPTER VII. 

 MEETIKQ Of OLD fBttRDB. 

 Great changes bad taken place in colonial alT&ir* since the opening at our tale. Tbe exlrn'.trflirrtry dtt-OuvcrieB oE the goldfitldB liad created Meufcauou tliough all parts, of the world, and ibousaudD of enterprising speculators and miccrd flocked to�ard# the scenes of such attr&oiions. All kinds of commercial adventures flourished; and among others that ol supplying demand for all kiuds of stock. Arthur Landon, wbojfol lowod oattls and horse dealing on his own account in the Viotorian markets, aoouruu lated a fair share of the geneai profits ob tained in that euooeseful trade. Jack Tan trum was no ICBB lucky, and was (apposed to be very wealthy, but his doubtful honesty bas been a bar to his suooesBes. Our hero,on the other band, bore an animpesobable character, and be was, in consequence, far more trusted. This raised Tantrum's ire and spito against bis honeBt and unassuming rival. Kathleen Haley's partiality to our hero wag another thorn in Sack's side. lie still pressed bis oft rejected petitions on the charming native beauty, but her faithfulness to her lover Arthur could not be shaken by the tempting wealth and personal attractions o( the clever horse-dealer, and tbe proprietor of the unknown "borse-ihoe station." Six years had now elapsed since the first appear ance of onr characters on the stage, and no alteration in the afJectionB Of the two yonng couples, who confessed their loves to one an other at that memorable kangaroo. hunt, had taken- place. Frank Anotey was still carrying on his vocation as tntor, and, al though be received several mysterious warn ings to leave the country, could not tear him self frcm the (asoinating attractions of the lovely Lizzy Landon, who pressed en bim the neoessity of sacrificing (heir mutual loves to the preservation of his own life. But Anstey was inexorable, and defied all the " horse-shoe " warnings. He often applied to Jack for hie private papers, but without avail. The borse-aealertold bim that be should never lay Angers on them until he bad ''cleared out," and landed in some other oountry, where Jaok would forward thorn on (eoeipt of tokens to that eBoot. Thus matters stood for the present, neither wiehir.g to go to extremities for fear of involving him lelf. 

 It was about this time that Arthur Landon made a trip to the Melbourne market with_ a mob of horses and cattle. On arriving in that oity,wbioh bad of late years grown into suoh size and importanoo, be directed bis steps as usual towards hie former private lodgings; for, being a temperate young man, and averse to gay and noisy oompany, ho seldom visited or put op at hotels. On enter ing the house in his rough bush garb be was shown by a servant-maid to a room where he could wash and change bis garments, snd, in going through bis necessary ablu tion the notes of a piano, coming from the dicing apartment adjoining, struek agree ably upon bis ears. Arthur, having a |Gne taste for musio, and living in a region where the luxury of a piano could not as yet be dreamt of, enjoyed and appreciated the more euch a harmonious treat. Hurrying on his fit out, he quietly entered the room whenoe tho strains proceeded leBt he should inter rupt the player, and standing on the thres hold beheld at the opposite end a little girl of about twelve, in short clotheB, sitting be fore a large instrument on whioh she played with apparent skill Borne beautiful and diffi cult picceB from musio before her. Never be fore in his life seeing a female co young per forming with suoh finish and taste,he stepped soitly on the CBrpet, until he gained a close position immediately behind ner seat, while she played without being aware of a stranger's presence. Besides the masterly execution ol her performance, he could not but admire tho deftnees of the email fingers bb, stretching out to their full extent, thoy compassed the octave. Nor did the pure dclioaoy and whiteness of her transparent bare shoulders and arms, and the clustering brown looks whioh fell from tho shapely head in natural ringlets around her ncck, fail to impress a young man singulsrly sen sitive to such charms. 

 At the conclusion of tbe performance, Arthur, who had been carried away fay the enchanting strains of the music, forgot that he had been a surreptitious listener, breathed out with enthusiasm: 

 11 Oh, many thanks, my dear 7" 

 The girl Rave a start, suddenly turning round on bcr musio stool and staring in his face with amazement. Arthur stood motion less on looking nt the large blue oyes and the parted lipB, as if eleotrifled at that steadfast 

 ^aie,wbiob be thought resembled some other 

 fuco now bauiiuiii! ln� muniriry. Ttiu littli lit'iv f-f'i.ni*? (1 nlnetru'^'-i' l in I !-c nunLcr, for her [;i'7.e wag bolh lunn and piercing; bat, without peaking a word, bhe roeo in fiomc cor.fu-inn from li.'r cc-ftt, when Arthur re mat 1 ed eagerly. 

 .' L?t me not disturb your roueio. 1 am jupt yoing out." But tlio youthful plByer, without replying, left the room, and while closing tho door behind her. gave him an other look willi her magnificent blue oyos. Arthur stood id the middle ol tho apartment for a lew. ueoouds, thinking to himself 

 aloud: 

 " I am almost positive (bat f baveLjgii^^ thos-o ryes and lips before." Then, - liafiiug the bell, which brought the fame maid-servant that he raw on tntering the houte, be put the following questions 

 " Who keeps this bobse now ?'' " Mre. Whitford, Bir." 

 11 Indeed, 1 thought it was some stranger, for I always lodge here." 

 " Yes, sir, eho has only ooma here lately." 

 " And is Mr. Whitford here also ?" 

 Mo, sir. Missus is a widow, Her husband died not long ago in the country." 

 " Wilt you please to tell her that I would like to speak to her?'' 

 " Tes, sir, I'll tell her at once." With that the girl vanished, and presently the land* 

 lady made her eppearbeco. ' 

 Mrs. Whitford, who was robed in her mourning, was a fine lady-like and matronly perton. Oa entering lha room Arthor in troduced himself, and the. lady r.fcver hoeing the name boforo, bowed an t'.t-kurxvud^t 

 'ment. 

 " I understand Mrs. Wliiiford," caid Arthur, " that you have not teen loni? in this house; it is my old lounings, and J always like to live in the eame place when in 

 town." . 

 .. I have only taken these premises lately, Mr. London. I have always been living in the country." 

 11 Bo I understand. But were you living some si* yearn back at the Upper Plenty ?" 

 " We had a faro) there, where ray husband died lately, bat, wishing to tend my child ren to eohool, I relinquished the farm on the death oi my husband, and took these lodgings." .... . r 

 Was that a daughter o� yours, whom I saw playing on tho piano as X entered J." 

 " No, eir. She is an adopted ohild, left en orphan by a friend of mine." 

 -> oh, indeed I Were ynu at the Upper Plenty on Blast Thursday 

 " Wo were, most unfortunately, end were burned out. It wu otter this that ray poor trUini died through sickness caused by terror and brought on under the belief that her ohild - whom you saw just now - had 

 periled iu the fire on that dre&dful day, - while she wai playing out with our neigh bours' children. But, fortunately, a brave youn:; bushman who had been passing that way saved the child's life at the riek of his 

 own." 

 41 Would you know thatyoung man again if you saw him, Mrs. Whitford f" 

 <. i doubt if I should now. He must have ohanged Binoe, for he appeared very young, Bad, to our stasune, wo never inquired his name, in the confusion of the moment." 

 " Well, I am that person, Mrs. Whitford. I thought I bad seen the fiirl's Jaoe before, 

 but oould not bring to memory. whsreJ-tjK^ 

 Been her." f 

 "Is it really possible that you are tho ?ame. Ot oourse, your beard makes the change so marked. How glad poor Nina will be on hearing ot the news. She pften mentions the ciroumitanoe and its horrors, and your kindnees to her is so vividly en graved on ber memory. She is otic of the kindest and most bfioctiouale creatures that ever I met.with. Hcrp1-: mother was a superior persohp batr'tins, ui.1'.itun^U. I still remember the eingul.ir impression that your voioe made on her, uud how it effected her on that day." 

 " It was most singular that her voioe also struck me as very like my mother's; but such coincidences often happen I eoivice. I should like to hear her historv, however, if 

 you have no objection, Mrs. Whilfonl." 

 "I am sorry to say, although I )�><! been her greatest friend in Australia tlin, t J know but little of her history, and tbatliule i" not very cheering. Bhe never told me ht*i maiden namo, for there appeared to bs eome secret about her birth or connections that slie did not wish to tell. I have no doubt, however, that she must have been from a good family at home. All Bhe told of her history was, that she was sent to a sominary tor young ladies, and, when at the age of seventeen, bad met with one ot those refugee Italian counts, who beoame enamored of her beauty, and enticed her to fly with him. Mot daring to return to hie own country, or to tsce her relations, they eamo oat here,where he found employment as teacher ot music. We were living in town then, and were their neighbours, nnd we bccamo very inti mate, until we took tho farm at the Plenty. Hearing from eome friends ot his in Italy, who gave him enoouragement to go home, and look after his property, which they thought he might reoover. owiDR to a rooro favorable turn in the politioal affairs ** thai disturbed oountry, her husband left her and their only child in my care until his return. He expected to be back in a twelve months after; but, unfortunately, no word was ever hoard from him eince. Whether lie had been imprisoned, or lost bis lite, is not known. Hisabeenoe and supposed death'preyed so muoh on the poor wife's mind (she was al ways delicate) that she fell into a decline, and, the shook of Black Thursday suooeed ing, she died. She implored me in her last moments to bring up and protect bor only child, and expressed a vague hope that the father might be still living and claim her. 1 have done ray utmost to attend to bcr dying request, and taught Nina musio, . and other matters the eame as my own little 

 girls, and now they attend the best ladies' school in Melbourne. I must say this for Nina-besides being the most obedient and 1 warm-hearted young creature, she is the 

 sharpest and most intelligent girl I ever met with in.learning music and singing," 

 " I have guessed thct, Mrs. Whitford, for I watched her unobserved just now: Un luckily she perceived me nnd ran away." 

 11 Never mind, Mr. Ijtuition, you shall hear enough of her performance if you rfcsy any time in town, I am Fure ehe will bo moBt happy to favor her former preserver. I will cal'l her aud introduce you." 

 With that Mrs, Whitford rang the bell; end when tho maid appeared ehe told her to BendupJ^inti. 

 Tbo charming little lady mado her appear ance bctoio tl-rm, when Mrs. Whitford spoko to her with motherly kindness bp fol

 11 Come hero, ray dear. Do you rccogaiee this gentleman ?" 

 " No, uicinma, but I thought when I heard hie voieo (irct th&t it rounded like one I had hcr.rd b fore.'' 

 " And you don't recognize the young gentleman ot whom you epeak so olten, and who saved jou from the fire on Black Thnvf-'ilry V"
