 Whfla Arthur' nt thoa eMaptoia�. by Nina's thrill�ng harmony, tba doer of tu room opened noiselessly, anda psir a(mif. ehiaTous eyes ptepad in, thc owner of which, on perceiving a stranger before him, ad- vanced boldly. . OB hearing him tba yoong player sprang to ber feet, exclaiming defi- antly: 

 " Aha, my bold Mr. Impudence ! Too did . Bot catch me thia timej hate BOW a guardian who will keep you off." 

 The person to whom thia caution waa ad- dressed was a handsome yoong man about twenty, and whoas provoking sanie at the excited Mina revealed hts tesxmg proclivities. Bia accuser went on: 

 "Now, Mr. Tormentor, if yon behave yourself, I will introduce yon to my guardian, Mr. Landon, I beg to present Mr. Pembroke 

 or Mr. Tease-aa I call bim sometimes chief clerk of ono of oar banks. Bot before 

 I Bit down to play, while ha ia in tba room, yon most promise me faithfully, if yon wish to hear mus�a or singing from me, to guard me from him. He steals behind my seat, and, like a thief, twists my head and 

 neck-" 

 "'And kieeta mei' Wbyldon'tyou finiah 

 your sentence?" laughed the nuaohisvous 

 Pembroke. 

 Arthur nnderelood at once tba �tate of 

 affaire, and the little quarrel which existed between the pasties, and, not wishing to cause interruptions to the music, he gave Mina the satisfactory proofs that bo would protect her in future. 

 "Mow, Miss Mina, jon lum introduced Mr. Landon, bnt nerer told me why yon claim him aa a protector," inquired Pern 

 broke. 

 "Because. Mr. Tease,' he gallantly saved my life on Black Thursday at the peril of bis own, when I waa surrounded by bash 

 fires." 

 "Oh! is this the gentleman himself ? I have often heard yon speak of bim, and waa anxious to see him. I suppose hell eat me 

 ont now." 

 "Mostundoubtedly, sir; bat Mr.Landon does not wish to tease litttle pirie like me." 

 Thus the pair went on, to the amusement of Arthur, who had to comply with bia en- gagement to tau tact KUM white aba ajn the piano. 

 . A midden friendship end confidence sprang op between them, and, whenever the hand eotna hat mischievous clerk attempted to steal or snatch a'kiss sorrepticionclj, she would fly to Arthur for protection, springing np on his knee, winding her arms round his nock, and burying her face in his bosom, crying ont at the same time: "Save me, save mo, Arthurl Bend away the nasty fellow!" 

 Arthur could not account to himself for 

 the �trange interest he took in the sprightly ; little girl. He felt some unaccountable and 

 irreei3table regard towards her. Notwithstand- ing the great confidence and regard Nina placed in Arthur, and the partiality he mani fasted towards her, a slight disagreement would take place between them at times, the 

 cause of which resulted from a little selfish- 

 ness on the part of the yoong lady, who wished to engross all Arthur's time to her- self. On one of these occasions, our hero who was a great reader of novels, purchased Bolwer'a " Alice, or the Mysteries," which Le began to read with great zest. Nina and Mrs. Whitford's eldest daughter-who was . about Nina's age-af ter coming from �hool one evening went up stairs to the dining room as usual, where they found Arthur alone, eagerly devouring the contents of the above-men tioned novel. They endeavored to draw him from his book to join them in some play or romp, but without avaiL Arthur pushed them off with one hand while he held the book in the other, still read- ing. 

 .* Rever mind him, I know a plan to annoy I him," eielahnfd Nina,poutingly, and,suiting 

 i the action to the word, ehe sprang up on the i long dining table which stood in the middle 

 of tte room4nviting her companion to follow ber example. Then they danced from ona end to the other with perfect skOl and grace, many difficult seta. Arthur could not but watch their movements at times despite hie annoyance at tba interruption ot his novel reading, and tba pair appeared to go through their walla**, schotiabes, and pfllkas,as easily and elegantly as any ladies of fashion. Attar having worn out his patieneawith tba noise of their small feet, Arther abasad them from ona end of tba tabla' to tba other, threatening to poU them off, but way wara too nimble for him, and be gave it op in despair and n tarnedtobis book. The girls swing that plan tailed, Nina proposed another, which 

 she well knew Arthur eoold not resist. Thia waa to approach the piano and play ona et our hero's favorite airs. Tba plan succeeded admirably, for tba book was laid aside, and Axthar drew bia efaair towards ono corner qi the rastroment, when Nina said pont ingly . 

 ..I have a great mind never to play yon a tune say roora, you sulky fellow." . 

 "I don't want yon to," replied Arthur 

 provokingly. 

 �You don't t" Nina, in a pet, IV��.-�- �am th� lid and pretending te re 

 faina* 

 i "Wefl,� you wtm% I mort only go I I 10018 other lodgings," replied Arthur, piel 

 iug np bia hst with assumed annoyance. 

 Nins watched him eagerly until ene sa that he was resolTed, when two large teat gathered in her eye�, and, raining toward hin, she mrt^"m^ imploringly : 

 "Oh, Arthur 1 would yon leave your poe Nina? I did not mean what I said." Th rest of the passionate protest was lost ii 

 sobs. 

 Arthur, who wu toothed greatly, con si�errf that he had gone too far, and, wit! hearfelt pity, took the girl on bia knee, an kitmd away her taara saying : 

 " I would be very eorry to leave yon. Nina I waa also in fun, and wanted to asa hoi yon would act. IH neves tts ss yoi 

 again !" 

 "I won't tease yon. either, Arthur. Ii would be vary naughty of nw attar an yom 

 kindness.'* 

 This wu the last quarrel they had, and ; their friendship became stronger than 

 1 ever. 

 j On another occasion, as Arthur had been 

 as usual standing behind ber seat while ehe played, in order to keep " Ur. Tormentor" at a distance, oar hero, who wu getting tired I of the imposed services laid upon him u 

 sentry for the young lady, pleaded (after driv- ing away Pembroke) 

 " Ksally, Nina, I am getting thad ot this constant watching, I must charge you, or demand some wagoe far this unpleasant billet. I cannot loee timo for nothing, standing behind a young lady like a ser- 

 vant." 

 "But yon mustraderstand, Arthur, that I ham nothing to give yon. I am too 

 poor.'' 

 ** WeU,I most only charge yon a kiss every 

 time I stand watch after thia." 

 "A kiss from a little thing like me? Ton don't cara about kissing little girls. If I were a big Lady it would be same 

 thuu." 

 I " Certainly, tha�w�uld be more aeeeptaue. StilLIinatothisbsrgainwithyou. Ieb�ll mark down in ray nota book every time I watch oTer jon in future, and yon moat pay me in kitsee when yan grow np."

 tune. ' 

 ! "Hot tn long, Nina, Bot I fear �nen yon grow np s fine lady, I ehall bav� bat little chanco of being paid. Toa will bava a lot of handaomer admirers, and, aa for kiss- ing me, yon woold be quite offended if I at- 

 tempted snob, freedom." 

 "Offended to kiss you, Arthur 1 Never 1 Do yon suppose that I oould ba offended at you?" 

 "Bat supposing I waa not to aaa yon for a long tima, and to meet you among company a fine grown np lady, wouldn't ron refusa to 

 kiss me 7" 

 " That wool* be rather fanny too, but I promise yon that I win pay yon wherever I meet yon, 'on demand,' aa Mr. Tormentor would say," replied Nina, langhin* heartfly 

 at the idea. 

 About this time toa playgoing people of Victoria �era greatly iuipreaaud by the per. fonnaoees of thoaa celebrated atara, the sisters Gogenheim, �ho had reeentr-| ar> rived in the colony, and created immense sensation. It waa a point of dispute among those who witnessed their performances, whether the graceful and stylish appearanaa of the gha-ming Adelaide, or tba arch and oetwitching expression of the winning Joey claimed the greatest admiration and atten- tion. Arthur Landon, at;tho earnest en� treaty of Pembroke who had asen the new stars-consented to visit the theatre one evening, and pressed Mrs. Whitford with ber little girls to accompany them. Nina, who had never before witnessed such a treat, wai in ecstatics at the pleasant prospect. 

 Securing a box in good time, ont parVy took early possession of it. Arthur eat by Nina's side daring the interesting and novel performance. 

 Notwithstanding the attractions of tba play, Arthur's eyes were often fixed with ad* miration mixed with apprebensisn on tba countenance of the excited Nina, whose whole soul appeared to ba eoneentrated on the performance. He never beheld her features animated with such animation and such changing lights before, nor could any noise or dist�rbense among the crowded fspeetatoia attract, for an instant, her gaze rom the stage. Not a word escaped her Up�, save now and then a few broken exclama- tions, roch as : "Ob, Arthur, how splendid 1 Isn't it grand? Did yon ever eoe the liker' and each bursts of delight. Arthur, whose elbow lent on tba aide of tba box with bia j hand supporting his head, gazed on tba 

 [lovely creature with some wonder and 

 ! sorrow,

 After leaving toa theatre, ana walking Dy Mrs. Whhford's aide, he remarked : 

 " Did you notice the excited effect which the performance had on Mina, Mrs. Whit- 

 ford ?" 

 " I did not notice. Poor child it was the time for her. Children alwaya take delight in 

 those scenes." 

 " Bat if yon had seen her expression, Mrs. Whitford. It may be a foolish idea of mine, bat I cannot get rid of it. I fear Mina will some day appear herself on a stage." 

 " Such nonsense, Mr. Landon ! Merer, I hope, while she is in my charge, and as long as I am able to maintain her," replied Mrs. Whit!ord.with a little naughtiness and anger 

 in her voies. 

 "I beg pardon, Mrs. Whitford. I am aware of your good wishes towards the poor orphan, and that she will never come so low while ander yon care. Bat her manners this evening bas filled me with alarm." After a few more observations on the subject, the conversation dropped. 

 Next morning Arthur, whose business in Melbourne had been all settled, prepared to take his departure. On seeing this, Mina was siezed with grief and cried immoderately^ob* bing between her tears : 

 " Oh, Arthur, who will protect ms now, 

 that tormentor will tease me to death. I 

 shan't play another tune till yon come back again." 

 Oar hero felt a little choking sensation while taking leave of the affectionate and in- teresting creature. She had made a strang�; impression upon bim, and her winsome fess and sprightly ways ocenpied bis thoughts many a day and year afterwards.
