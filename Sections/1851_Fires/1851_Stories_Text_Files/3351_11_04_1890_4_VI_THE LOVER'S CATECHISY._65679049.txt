Her "brilliant dyes sparkled like diamonds,.ad? her 'eheeks and'lips glowed with the vermillion of health' ind pleasure. '"It was s splendid run. What a; game Sfellow -that flyer was, the most wiry brute I eveilollowed." replied Arthur, dismounting and cotting off the game's tail as a S"My grasoioous i what io become of lthe othere?" ex?laimed Kathlesen, muting her panting and froth oovered steed around. "Oh, never mind them. Thes Lizzy is meh a coaed, I suppose she ot toek n at somes little creek orlog, Anstey will look after her," exclaimed Anstey, carelesely. "I hope 'neither of them hae got a fall, suggested Kathleen, feeling rather uneasy, and a little awkward alone with Arthur fot the first time since the memorable perform 'ance lf "Romeo and Juliet." " oNever fear about their falling. Lizsy is too timid to attempt a ledp, and" Anetey is too good a horseman," replied Arthur. " Let us hurry back and see," suggested Kathleen, getting more uneasy and confused every moment. S"What a hurry you are in to get beak to them. A" person would imagine you were afraid of losing aight of Anetey," put in Arthur, with some pique, still under the sos picion that the tutor was a favorite of Kath leen. "To lose sight of Aneteyl Well, well. Arthur. I did not expect that from you," re plied Kathlhen,while two large tears struggled for a fall in her large blue eyes. On per ceiving this Arthur repented of his cruel in-' sinuation and remarked : "Forgive me, Kathleen, you must know I feel very lonely ever since Anetey came. No one to ride with me in the bush us for.' merly, while he has all you youog ones n bis company every day. Boeides that I can see by your manner, Kathleen, that you do not want my company partitunlaly when alone." ' This open conferelon and ingenuous plha wung Kathleen's heart, while she had not vstrage or boldness enough to oentese her realt feelings towardsher companion. If Arthur had owned the experience, or pofeeaned the smallest gift of the phiriogno mit to read the language of the eyes, h e -woold hare had no need to follow up his steohising, but poor fellow he was only r novice in love affalrs. Kathleen, seeing his total ignorance of the state of her heart, and not wishing him to runaway with the idea that the did not care for his company, broke through the little; fortification which she had onatruooted round her secret, and replied after a pause: "If you fanocy that I do not care for your company. Arthur, you are very moouh mis taken. I often think of the happy days .when we rode together, and would like to continue them, but I suppose people would say that we are growing too o!ld for that, and that it was not vtry proper for sgrl like : "Well Ldid not think of that, Kathleen. I suppose it is not the fashion of the world; still, for all that, you need not be so distant 'to me always. I can hardly get a word with You. I I knew that you did not hate me I would be more content." "Goodgraciousl Hateyou, Arthur? You are the last in the world that I could hatel what put that idea into your head?" "I fancied that you liked Anatey better through being more often in his com pany." "What astupid idea, Anatey does notoere a fig for me, nor I for him. I did not think yoo were so blind. Thereu one he likes well-" Kathleen checked herself instantly on thinking of Lizzy'eseeret,whi she did not wish even her brother to suspeet, nor would she have gone eo far were it not to clear away Arthur's misconception that Anatey washer own favorite. Arthur's eyes were now opened; but he was still under the im. preesion -that Kathleen was indifferent to. wards himself, and was therefore resolved, while h had such an excellent opportunity, to sound her heart. "Well, I was a goose, Kathleen," said he, "I never dreamt that Anstey would prefer Lizzy to you." " Why not? I am sure she Is prettier and more ladylike, you must have observed that

"I will answer every question you will put, honestly and faithfully, if you answer mine afterwards." "'Tis a bargain, Arthur. Now mind, I shall pt all my questions first, and after I have done you can commence." "Agreed on, but you mast not keep on too long, for you might question on until we ar. rived at home, and I would have no time to eateehie�s o." - - SThat c good idea of your ; but never fear; yo shall have plenty of opportunityi Now I begin:-".

S."Ta' lreshotl?" " "Tall." SA good or bad rider?" "Plent class." "Whbat iher name r' "Kathleen Haley."' - The oharming qeestioner now eame to a dead stop, and blushed visibly. Arthur, in like manner, seemed a little confused, but wishing to have his revenge;' began on his side : i 1 Now, my lady, you have my secret, stand to your bargain. Kathleen Haley are you in Iove 7, "I am." "Deeply?' " "Lther." lIs the gentleman good or ordinary look' "Half and between." "What is the color of his hairl' "Black." "His eyesl" "Ditto." "Tall or short?" "Middle height." ' Good or bad rider r' "Capital?" "W\\Veal is his name 7" At this question Kathleen struck Kate Ktrrey in the flank with her whip, which r1nt her off at full speed to overtake Anstey .niLizzy, whom she beheld some distance a'ead. slowly walkhing their horses, towards home. Arthur sporred on his horse in foll oitee to overtake the fair fugitive, in order to have his last question replied to. It was an exciting race between the pair, hot des p te Arthor's trnuouo efforte. Kathleen kept herdistonoe. and gained the leading couple, who wheeled around their horses on hearing the approaching galloping." "My GOraeoo s What is the matter Kathleen," exclaimed Lizzy, in alarm. "Oh. it is nothing hat a ramo between me me and Arthur. You are witnesses that Kate Keanney beat his flah eomeo." (a name Arthur gave his present nag.) -'Don'tbelisveher, .izzy. It is a great shame, she ran away to get ot of a bar. ain," eclaimed Arthur, with seeming veoa tion. " ; " , Ansley and Lizzy exchanged a sigulfioant smile, thinking of their own little bargain, when the former remarked : "Ca yon not finish or complete your bar gain now as well." "Oh, it is a private one," exclaimed Arthur ionocently. "Well, ride a-head, Lizzy, and I will walk behiog," suggested Ansley. ".No, nol I won't part with Lizsy any more." exclaimed Kathleen. "Well then tell Lizzy the name of the per. son I asked, and Lizy will tell me alfter wards." suoggested Arthur. " I will then; but you and Mr. Ansley most ride a little in front, and must not turn your faoee round until we get home," replied Kathieen, her face suflfused with blushes. Then she whispered "Arthur Landon," in Lizzy'o ear. According to agreement, the two young men rode in front, when Lizzy pulled up to his aids, and whispered his own name in his ear, which filled him with glad nooes mixed with .some surprise, true to his agreement, however, he refrained from teming round to gire a thankful look to his idol, and was therefore obliged to ride out with Anetey in front, while the two happy girls gave vent at last to their long pent-op secrete, and the singaulr coinoidener that both couples had declared their loves on the eame evening. Lizzy did not rereal any of Anstey's history, however. The love part was quielte efnient for Kathleen, who told her own and Arthue's in return. We need not repeat here the happTness whieh filed the bosoms of the whole hunting partyon that special evening, nor the soft and sly looks they exchanged on arriving at home. Alal I they little dreamt of the dark clouds hanging in the distanoe which would soon envelope their new born happiness in their gloom. CHAPTER VII. umzmo or OLD ]ars]DI. Great changes had taken place in oolonial affairs since the opening of our tale. The extraordinary discoveries of the goldfield had created sensation through all parts of the world, and thousands. of enterprising speculators and miners floeked towards the sceces of such attractions. All kinds of commercial adventures flourished; and among others that of supplying demand for all kinds of stock. Arthur Landon, who;fol lowed cattle and horse dealing on his own aeeoaut in the Victorian markets, aerumo lated a fair share of the general profits ob tained in that eaccesaul trade. Jack Tan. trem wanoless lneucky, and was supposed: to be very wealthy, but his doubtful honesty habeen a bar to his snooese. Our heroon the other hand, bore :an unimpeachable oharacter, and he was, in conaequence, foar more trusted. This raisod Tantruom's ire and spite against his honest and unassuming rival. Kathleen Haley's partiality to our hero was another thorn in Jack's side. He still pressed his oft rejected petitions on the eharming native beauty, but her faithfulness to her lover Arthur oould not be shaken by the tempting wealth and personal attractions of the clever horse-dealer, and the proprietolr of the unknown "horse-shoe station." Bii years had now elapseed since the first appear' aoneo o ur charactere on the stage, and no alteration in the affections of the two young couples, who oonfessed their loves to one an other at that memorable kangaroo hunt, had token place. erank Anstey was still carrying on his vocation as tutor, and, al though he received several mysterioos warn lngs to leave the country, could not tear him self from the fasecinating antractions of the lovely Lirzy Landcn. who pressed on him the necreity oe saorifioing their mutual loees to the preecrvation ol his own lile. lot ausley wes inevorable, and defled all the "horae-ahos" warnings. Ho often applied to Jack for hit private papers,..ht without avatl. The horse.dealertold him that he shaold oeier lay l'cggr?? ca them until he had 

 -�elesed out." and landed in some other -ountry, where Jask would forward them on receipt of tokens to that effect. Thou matere tood for the present, neither wiehing to, go to extremities for fear o involving him It was about this time that Arthur Landon made a trip to the Melbourne market with a mob of horses and cattle. On arriving in that city,which had of late years grown into obh sizre and importance, he directed his eteps as usual towards his former private lodgings; for, being a temperate young man, and averse to gay and noisy company, he seldom vsittedor put up athotels. On enter ing the honse in his roogh bush garb be was shown by a servant-maid to a room where he could wash and change his garments, and, in going through his neceesary abl-. lion the notes of a piano, coming from the dining apartment adjoining, struck agree. ably upon his ears. Arthur, having a line taste for musio, and living in a region where the luxury of a piano could not as yet be dreamt of, enjoyed and appreciated the more nuch a harmonmaus treat. Hurrying on his dt unt, he quietly entered the room whence the strains proceeded lest he should teinr. 'mpt the player, and standing on the thres hold beheld at the opposite end a little girl of about twelve, in short clothes, sitting be feoe a large instrument on which she played with apparent skill some beautiful and di-. cult Vieees from music before her. lever be fore en his life seeing a female so young per forming with uch filnish and taste,he stepped softly on the carpet, nntil he gained a close position immediately behind her seat, while she played without being aware of a stianger'e presence. Besides the masterly rexection of her pelormance. he could not hut admire the deftness of the small fionere Oa, stretahing out to their full extent, they compassed the octave. Nor did the pure delicaoy and whiteness of her transparent bareh shoulders and arms, and the clustering brown looks which fell from the shapely head in natural ringlets around her neck, fail to impress a young man singularly sen. itie eto sach charms. 'At the conclusion of the performance, Arthur, who had been carried away by the enchanting ltrains of the music, forgot that he had been a surreptitioue listener, breathed ont with entboeiasm : , Oh, many thanks, my dear P" The girl gave a start, suddenly turning round on her music stool and staring in his faem with amazement. Arthur stood motion. less on looking at the large blne eyes and the parted lips, as if eletrifded at that steadfaest -aae,which he thought reoembled some other ram now haunting his memory. The litle lady semed abetracted in like manner, for her gaze was both long and piercing; but, without speaking a word, she rose in some conueinon from her seat, when Arthur re-m marked eagerly. "Let me not disturb your muis. I am ust going out." But the youthful player, without replying, left the room, and while closing the door behind her, gave him an. other look with her magnisent blue eyes. Aethur stood in the middle of the apartment lor a few seconds, thinking to himself aloud : "I am almost postive that I have seen thoane eyes and lips before." Then, ringing the bell, which brought the sname maid-servant that he saw on entering the houue, he put the following questions : "Who keeps this house now?" " Mien. Whiltord, sir." "Indeed,I thought it wa somes tnnlger, for I always lodge here." "Yes, anir, shea has only some he latelva 'And i' Mr. Whitsord here also r " No, sir. Misseus is a widow. Her husband died not long ago in the country." "Will yon please to tell bar that I wanld like to speak to her?" "Yes, air, I'll tell her at oneu." WIth that thes girl-vanihed, and presently the lando lady made her appearance. " lre. Whitford, who was robed in her mourning, was a fine lady.like and matronly person. On entering the room Arothur in troduced himself, and the lady never hearing the name before, bowed an amknowlodg ment. "I understand Mrs. Whitford," said Arthur, "that youn have not been long in this house ; t is my old lodgings, and I always like to live in the rume place when in town." "I have only taken the?s premises lately, Mr. Landon. I have always een sivng in the ceountry." a So I understand. But were you living some six years bank at the Upper Plenty7" "'We had a farm there, where my huseand died lately, but, wishing to send my child ren to eshool, I relinquished the farm on the death of my husband, and took these lodgings." "Was that a daughter of youn, whom I saw playing on the piano as I entered I" "Nm, ir. She is an adopted shild, left a orphan by a friend of mine." "Oh, indeadl Were you at the Upper Plenty on Black Thursday?" "We were, most unfortunately, and were burned oat. It wa after this that my pool eneed died throogh sickness eanseed by terres and brought on under the belief that her child- whom you saw just now--had periehed in the fire on'that dreadful day while she was playing out with our neigh. bours' children. But, fortunately, a brave young bushman who had been passing that way saved the child'a llfe at the risk oa his "Would you know that young man again if youen saw him, Mrs. Whitfurd P" " doubt if I should now. He must have changed cine, for'he appeared very young; and, to our shame, we never inquired his name. in the oonfusion of the moment." "Well, I am that person, Mrs. Whitfoerd. I thought I had seen the girl's fane before, but could not bring to memory where I had ten her." "Is it really possible- that you are the same. Of coourse, your beard makes the change so marked. How glad poor Nina will be on hearing of the news. She often mentions the ciruenmstance and its hrorrors, and your kindneess to her is so vividly en graved on aher memory. She is one of the kindest and moet affectionate ereatures that ever I met with. Her poor mother was a snperior person, but. alas, unfortunat e. still remember the aingular impression that your voice made on her, and how it affeeted heron that day." "It was most singular that her vOice also strnuck me Mas very like my mother's; but euch coineidencee often happen I esuppose. I should like to hear her history, however, if eou have no objection, Mirs. Whitford." "I am sorry to say, although I had been her greatest friend in Australia that I know but little of her history, and that little is not very cheering. She never told me hermaiden name, for there appeared to hbe some secret abont her birth or connections that she did not wish to tell. I have no doubt, however, that she must have been from a good family at home. All she told of her history was, that she was sent to a eeminaury for young ladies, and, when at the age of seventeen, had met with one of those refugee Italian otunts, who became enamored of her beanuty, and enticed her to ly with him. Not daring to return to his own onuntry, or to faos her relations, they came out here,where he foond employment as teacher of musin. We were licing in town then, and were their neirhboers, and we beeamc very inti. mate, until we took the farm at the Plenty, Hearing from some friends et his in Italy, who gave him enaouragement to go heme, aud look after his property, whioh they thooeht he might recover. owing to a more lavorablo turn in the political a?tree~ *,lat

Whether hehadbeean imprisoned, or lost his life, is not known. Hi absence and supposed death preyed so much on the poor wife's mind (she was al ways delio e) that she fell into decline, and, the shook of Black Thursday succeed ing, she died. She implored me in her last moments to bring up and protect her only child, and expressed a vague hope that the father might be still living and claim her. I have done my utmost to attend to her dying request, and taught Nina music, and other matters the same as my own little girls, aud now they attend the best ladies' school in Melbourne. I must say this for Nina-besides being the most obedient and warm-hearted young creature, she is the sharpest and most intelligent girl I ever met with in learning mosic and singing." "I have guessed that, Mrs. Whitford, for I watched her unobserved just now. Un luckily she perceived me and ran away." "Never mind, Mr. Landon, you shall hear enough of her performance if you stay any time in town, I am sure she will be most happy to favor her former preserver. I will call her and introduce you." With that Mrs. Whitford rang the bell; and when the maid appeared she told her to send up Nina. The charming little lady made her appear. ance before them, when Mrs. Whittford Spoke to her with motherly kindness as fol low: " Come here, my dear. Do yeou recognize this gentleman ? : "No, mamma, butithought when I heard his voice first that it sounded like ounehad beard before." "And you don't:recognize the young gentleman of whom you speak so often, and who saved you from the fire on Bleak Thorsday ?I" Nina made an involuntary spring towards Arthur, as if she were going to embrace hm, but ehscking hersele instantly. with her oheeks sufoused with blushes, dropped her eyes with her hands extended towards the young man, who held them in his. "Go on, my dear, kiss him,"' suggested Mrs. Whitford, provokingly, on seeing the motion, and interpreting the meaning. Nina turned mound with confusoion, and buried her pretty face on her adopted mother's shoulder when Mrs. Whitford added, smiling at Arthur: "Don't you like to kins him now, as you did long ago."
