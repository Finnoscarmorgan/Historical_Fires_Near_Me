"ie has told mne that his step-brother, -ahbs been for some years in Ame~rica, irsn made threats against him in his p~iote fits, but he did not regard them ,nidwlr. "s it known if this brother really did go to America ?" he asked, looking up. "Hisfather gave me some information regarding hism, but ihe only surmised that hehad sailed to America." "'Idid not know him," the girl re trned, "but I have heard Charles say that it was not known for certain whether he had gone there or not.' He often ex praned a wish that he would return. I amsure Charles had nor the slightest ill ill to his step-brother." "Of course the the younger son would in hrit the entire fortune if the elder were thus repudiated." "I do not know in what manner 'Mr. Edgar proposed disposing oThis fortune," she auswered; ' and I am sure any such motive of enriching himself at his brother's expense never entered the head of the younger one." "Of course not," answered thelnspec. tor, oothingly, for his visitor wasbegin ingto show signs of indignation at the thought of anyone imputing mercenary motives to her late lover. "From what I have heard of Charles Edear I believe him to have been a kimd-hearted, excellent young man, and I hope, Miss Devereaux, tl1at we will, ere long, find him alive and well." He said this to console the poor girl, for her wan face and .wistful manners touchedhim. "God grant that you may," she ferrentlyreplied, and then tihe Inspec tor accomepanied her to the door, as she wished to go. "Lynx will be here at nine o'clock to morrow morning, and if you will give me your address I will send him to you." "Union Hotel, Collins-street," she answered, and then departed with a heavy heart, for apparently the author ities we:e quite in the dark regarding herlover's fate. Next morning the detective called on her, but he had very little to tell. He oas still at work on the case, but he found it an extremely difficult one, and could not even get a pea to hang atheory on as lhe expressed it. Hope, which "springs eternal in the human breast," however, whispered that success would crown his efforts in the end, and he-as sanguine that ere long he would solve the mystery. He gave Miss Devereaux instructions how to reach 3Cr. Rennie's selections, but ercnsed himself from accompanying her by saying that his presence would.not be sgreeable to the young man, and would look like a menace. This was palpably true, and by the first train next day Adeline Devereaux reached Woodend, and, hiring a vehicle from tihe Commercial Hotel, set 7out for Campaspe in the company of a driver who ones the district. CHAPTER X. THE FREE SELECTOR. Victorian legislators as a rule do not stand high in the estimation of the more thoughtful portion- of he "community. Occasionally a demagogue rises who with glib promises to the masses attains a temporary popularity not warranted by thie Acts he places on the Statute Book, but taking our Houses of Parliamenrt in General their members, have done much to deserve the respect of the people. Assuredly one of the most beneficial steps that was ever taken to ensure the Prosperity of Victoria was the system of free land selection, which was inaugu rated in the "sixties.'" Like every other innovation its first rinciples, crude as they necessarily were, may have aided to swell the already arge estates which the act was" intended to prevent, but the- general result of the new departure has been to settle on the land a sturdy yeomailryiZ-which; we are told, is the backbone of a country. Judging by the history of France this is true, for the policy which aims at mak ing each man his own landlord tends to solve the great problem, exemplified in the Irish Question, of national quietude. If the axiom that an Englishman's hbone is his castle be true, how much itre forcibly may it be applied to the than who owns the fee simple of the soil surrounding his house. Such ownership produces a sense of in dependence which cannot fail to raise the standard of mankind in the country chich allows such an opportunity to its inhabitantr.t o The whinin, tone the crouching gait end general marks of grovelling saubser dence typical of.the semi-paupers in the 

 old land, who scarcely own the rags which cover them, and who, if not par tially supported by the parish, are pen sioners of noblemen or other landed magnates, is noticeably absent in coun tries that allow the many, and not the few to possess theland. Nothing is perfect of course in this im perfect world, but with all their faults the Australian Land Acts have done much to ensure the future stability and prosperity of this great continent, which, like the. rising sun, is now beginning to throw a few straggling beams on the hori zon of history, lighting it up with the rosy tifits' of. dawn, and foreshadowing the dizzling effulgence whichi ill mark tlioemiridiiian of Australia's progress. , Amongst the foremost to take advan tage of.the first land-act was Rennie. iSince the ,nist6ous disappearance of his, tourist conimpinon, Edgar, with its tragical surroundings, lie had remained in Melbourne, shunned- by his few ac quaintances, nd feeling that he was sus pectedof 'knowing imore than he cared to divulge of the :fate:-of his late com rade. The missisig man's fatherihad come over from Sydney to seek for his son, and he hld offered a irewird of �1000 for his dis cover'y alive or ed. '. It was in. vin, for though numerous search parties eager. to obtain the reward scoured' the mountain ranges, not the slightest trace could bafound, and after a stay of three months in Melbourne, the disconsolate fatlier returnied to his lonely and stricken'hoii~ . : Hie had 'seer?al interviews with enunie during hi?:isit, and tfiough his mind wis clouded --ith'. suspicion against him sAt first, is sinister thoughts were gradually removed; )and:he lefti .the young man with the full cnr.viction that he was perfectly innocent of any part in his sou's disappearance. :' . .. Renhie solemnly assured him that lie would'niake, it liis life's task to lift the shadow that: h.,ad thus. suddenlry fallen across'. theirlives, i'aid darkened"'the fitiire of both, -and with this assurance the' old man departed,' feeling that.as long . as Rennie lived nno effort would be spared: to ,solve "the strange ,pro blem. During the firat rush of land selection it was fot necessary to go farionland for a suitable area; arid Rennie had a bewilder iig choice of good lots."-' :---'. The stigma: of guilt,: however, .which was attached to him by his fellow men, and which: the newspapers gave -wide publicity to *by "many. m insinuations, made hinm'to. some extent a- misan thrope. . "'"' : ' ; ' " : - His gregarious instincts hadforthe' time,been effacedby the ruthless hand of the slanderer and the false .judgment his fellow men:lhad: formed of him, and he decided to withdraw as much as possible from the world; thaj is, as much as would Sbe consonaint with his desire to unravel the mystery of CharlesaEdgar. - :- - The mountain pieaks of MAicedon and Diogeins posssesed a fasciiation for him; and he felt uineasy when out of siglitof these towerisng land marks. . .. His lUest for laid, combined with his desire to avoid the busy haunits of nmen, led his footsteps into the heart of the Black Forest,;and about ten miles from Macedon, and in full view of the mounts, at the source of the Campaspe river;flie decided to settle. '' ' The locality atat tht time was indescrib abily wild. Immense trees grew so thickly that in some places the beams of tlie sun never penetrated.' In spots, patches had .been leared away by the -great whirlwind of fire'6n Black Thursday, -which ravaged the cele brated forest. : - - ' . Choppy ranges ? and narrow valleys serrated the country liki the: teeth of a saw, and left out -small tracks of flat land. The soil was, however, excel lent. ' - . The 'wood cutter arid the saw-mriller had beguni their .work of subduing'the forest on differeiit sidea's of Rennie's'elec-. tion, but some miles from him. " " ., Towards Woodend the timber was being rapidly r sent to Melbourne; whilst the mining districts of Blackwood and Daylesford werre gradually extending their clearings into : the primevial woods; - STo-day the black forest exists b'nt as i legend and the senek of tmanyo striange ad venttres, yet thirty years ago the ixe had scarcely touched it so 6do wse.proogess in this young arid igorous la d. The head of.,the Gmpaspe; which, rising in the heart of tie forest,:flows: through the fertile districts of Carlsrhiue, Kyneton, -'past: Bendigo; and over the northern plains of Elmore and-Rochester into the Murriay at Echuca, was a roiiah tic and beautiful spot. '' '. : :- ; Starting from a .clnar spring it in a short distance is augmented to a peren nial stream. : Flowing . over a rocky bed the water is so crystal like that the small black fish, with'. whichiit abounds, can lie plainly seen swimming around at'adepth of five or six feet,; while the .tifiY-s called trouit-float, visible like' ambeii sp cs, at even agireater depth. ' I Jna 'distance of five miles from he i source there are nho less than ur ivater falls of surpassing loveliness. ' .I' -?, . At these places the solid rock has by some means been scooped out, probably by the washing away of soft strata, and the never-ceasing action of the :water has 'caused the most curious' and ')gio tesqile formations. ' " . ' * Sofiie of them rise out of their liqiid bed statue like, as horrible aiid repel lant as Chinese Gods, whilst others, as surne the shape of different biids "and animals. " .... . In one instance, a magnificent rock, about ten feet high,, exactly resembles a petrified Kangaroo, whilst another is the verisimilitude of agigantic squattingduck; indeed, a small zoological collection in stone could be made here. Strange hollows and bore holes are worn. in the solid rock, some of them saucer shaped, and others perfectly round and apparently bottomless. These are filled with the crystal water, and teem with small fish. It would be a paradise for the eel, but these serpent like fish are not found in-any river north of the Dividing Range. After running over the vast table rock where the natair.l museum of curiosities is-placed, the bright water falls over a ledge of rocks a distance of about fifteen feet, sparkling like diamonds, into a still pool below, which numerous wild fowls make their haunts as -abundant food is found, and the solemn quietness of the spdt makes it still more acceptable. The banks are lined with the wild rasp berry, over which thewattle tree bends, and towering above all, those grand old Titans of the forest-the eucalypti throw out their protecting arms, the whole forming a picture of river beauty seldom equalled and never excelled. The first ten miles of the Campaspo is a succession of scenes like this, after which a remarkable change for the worse takes place when it runs thr'ough settle ment, and it becomes a prosaic -and muddy beatn connrse. From near Bendigo 

 to It estuary t is an uninviting and un. romantic channel. The river may be taken as an emblem of human life. Startirg out with the purity, quiet and innocence of childhood and romance of youth, which looks at the world with the bright, though delusive eyes of Hope. Contact with the reality speedily works a change for the worse. The innocence and peace of childhood dis appears before the sin and storms of the world, and the purity of our youth is supplanted by the turgid passions of our more mature ago. The glowing anticipations-the castles in the air-of our early years, fade away and leave nothing but the dull and spirit less thoughts-toio " might have beens," of declining age, and we glide into the grave to mix our dust with generations who have gone before us, and who started out on the river of life with the same bright promise. Human life has many similes. Rennie had some difficulty in pursuad ing himself to'settle down in the wild and lonely paradise he had selected for his home. Used to cheerful company, ahndbrought up in a city, it required no slight wrench to former habits to bury himself in his hermit like retreat. He was a comparative novice to bush life, but when he finally determined to become a free selector on the Cjmpnsae, he ivent into the work with vigor. .Employing a few experienced bush men, they soon cleared a few acres and built a substantial log hlouse, atter which they fenced in the ground, and Earnest Rennie had fairly joined the army of siiall settlers who were fast over-running the colony. IIe had seven hundred pounds and ox-' pectations from Home, so that he was in an immiieasurably better iositioni than most other 'siblectors, who took' ups land with scaircely enough capital to pay tli survey 'fees, anid'whi6 foi :years after toiled'like galley 's$vst' in abjectipoverty in what was frequently ' vain'attempt to obtain the fee simple of the ground. .Meri like Reninie wha had .capital ulti mately bonght out such struggling people, and increasad. their driginal small hold ings to dimensions'which vere nmple' to combine grazing with agriculti'ual-pur' SWithin' "twelve imonths. of Rennib's settlement at'the hlad of, the Canipaspe,, nearly the' whole of. th land along the river had been" pegged out and applied for by various pleople, so 'that the pioneer soon had'neighbours who frequehtly boke in pon the privacy of his wild' etreat; " CHAPTER XI. S-:.*--i : ,.lNIEt'S- HOMII. It was a rough journey through awild country which Miss Devereaux had'to travel in' order to reach Rennie's new home. " The asounid of crashing trees falling before ite iwo dman'sa axe 'lib3ok upon the ear'anid in' every directioiutlie remains' f stately eucalypti, with a small portion only,: of the trunk; taken away for use, were lying around c :1.. . _ .. ; SThe.waste of fine timber was almost be-, yond conception, and it induced a bitter. Neinesis soon:after';for tlie vast quantity of fallen timber, when itW became dry, took fire, and swept away many homes and the fruits of much labor." :' - . . i Although distant, from n oodend donly seven miles, it occupied ftilly, tio hours to reach IRnnie's clearing. Tthere was no road, save the tracks made by' the wood carters which led nvowhere in; particular, and the steep ranges were not easily, sur. imounted.: - . .:. : : It was mid-day when they reached their destination, andeas they stopped for. t moment on the top of a high . range, overlooking the head of the Cafipaspe, Miss Devererix 'was 'surprised to sec theo change thathad been wrought on Reinie's selection. . , . " .. i Aspace of fully a hundred acres.had b een clearied' during . the. short time the occupant had beenin :possession, and a number of men with teams of bullocks were still busily engaged in the work;' ."' : i A. rough;" though substantial house stood on a slight eminence in' the middle of the clearing, and several other smaller erections' were :visible a short distnice , Towards the 'ai n buillding the driver weift, and s they neared it a tlioughtful, e'ad lye'd iman camoi ut to meet them with acordial welcome.'.. . * * :::' SAs le looked at.the lady his' face, grow a'shade paler; for le at once recognised .Ier ias- Miss ;Devereaui:,thougli she ap pesred yeair' older than tlieeiight months sinceIhe hadl see'i her 'would warraiit. Hs'&easilyj~uMssed the reason. . ' - "Mr. Innie," she said, leaping outgof thd vehicle, I am glad to see'you agiii,".; and she went towards hinmwith extended SHer kind greeting reassured 'hinf,"fr he'had expected reproichful glaces td nd bitter words from thegirl' whose lioverihe wa's the meainsi of 'ringing ,to Vitoria awiy fromn her side. ..... . '. ' "I am sincerely glad 'to see� yoi,' Miss Devereaux. 'If I had kn'oiiiRf your in-. tended visit I would have met you.at the station and brought: you over. It is a rouoh road." With all his oldgracod,he invited:her inside, ad she found the iiterior' much more comfortable than she expected; :;.:-� i I[have two married men working: for me," he explained. "Their wives and families live in yonder cottages, and' the women look after my poor house and'dul the'corking. So you see I am niotf'sich a hermit as you might think." Jus5. then one of the women came into the room, and Rennie introduced her. as Mrs. Affleck, and requested'her to Wait on Miss Devereaux while she remained with them. The young lady expressed her intention of returning to Woodend during the course of the afternoon, but Rennie begged her not to go until, at least, the following day. " We can make you quite comfortable here, I assure you," he urged, "and you will find a few days' change in the bush quite a relief from the bustle and worry of cit, life. Besides, you must be tired out. She was not anxious to leave, and was easily persuaded to remain. Mrs. Affleck was a good, motherly woman, and Adeline was soon quite at home with her. After changing her dress and partaking of a plain but wholesome meal, Miss Devereaux accepted Rennie's invitation to view the clearing operations. Backed up withl the needful money, the young selector had certainly worked wonders in the primevsl forest, and was rapidly making a comfortable lhonme. As they walked around, the thought which was uppermost in their minds found vent. " My dear friend," Rennie said, turn. ing to the young.girl, and speaking in a low voice, " I know you have come to this colony in search of your promised husband, and my best friend, Charles Edgar. " Him trmnge dinappearanc hau thrown 

 a shadow over both our lives. I know it has been a fearful blow to you, and to me it seems like a awful dream, from which I shall awake and find that I have been indeed dreaming, and see you and Charles Edgar passing through life hand in hand together. I have been almost hunted from my fellow-men by a foul and unjust suspicion, but I felt rewarded to-day for all I have suffered when you clasped my hand and I read in your face my inno cence proclaimed there." "Never for one moment," sym pathetically answered the young girl, "did I think you were to blame for Charley's disappearance. I know that you had a genuine affection for-him, and if I can read character at all, I believe you would not stoop to' a mean and ignoble action, much less to embrue your hands in innocent blood. "No. Mr. Rennie, do not let us ever talk of such an absurd suspicion. But as we are both interested-deeply interested -I' claim your ielp in clearing the mystery up. As sure- as the sun shines in the heavens, if a foul crime has been committed, justice, though tardy, will overtake tihe criminal, and if not, we nust only trust in an over-ruling Pro vidence to show us light where now all is darkness. I have dedicated my life to that one purpose, and I shall never rest content until I know the fate of Charles Edgar." SShe spoke in such a determined voice that her companion could not help looking at her. The flashing eyes and heaving breast bore eloquent testimony to the excite ment under:which she labored, -" Our mission, in life is the same," an swered the young man,'! for I have made aivow never to miss an 'opportunity of lifting the'dark veil which enshrouds the fate of Mr.:Edgar.

He gave the girl an evasive answer as i to what the clue was, for if there was any i truth in the story he heard it pointed to I fact that Charles Edgar must have been murdered. I It was only a tap-room yarn. In talk ing with one of his original employes about the affair which had created such a sensation, the old fellow, who was fond of his grog when near a shanty, recollected i that about the time it happened, a weary looking, restless man' came intb the bar of i the Hanging Rock hotel, near Woodend, 3 and indulged very freely in' whisky.
