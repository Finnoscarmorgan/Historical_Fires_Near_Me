 Everywhere there were proofs that the Deans were people of superior tastes, who had ideas 'beyond mere squatting. At tlie gate tliej saw the figure of a man leaning over and watching the road, who,' aa they approached, shaded his eyes with his hands, and then came forward to meet them. 

 'Hallo, lads. How did you fare?' said Mr. Dean, extending a hand to both. .' I did not expect to see you so soon, 'David. How did you get on with Cooper P' ' He wants to know if you could let him have five of those merino ewes of the last breed so ae to miv along with his. He is ?willing to give you your own price for them.' 'I'll see about it by-and-bye.' Then, turning to John, he said, ' 'Welcome John, welcome to Mount Dean. I am glad to see you looking so well.' ' Give my respects to Miss Agnes, sir,' eaid David, addressing Mr, Dean, as he rode off with the horses. ' How do you like the bush life, John ?' asked Mr. Dean as they walked towards the house. ' It would not be fair to give you an answer yet Mr. Dean, I have scarcely had time to form an opinion.' On entering the dining-room, which like wise presented many instances in its furnishing of the same superior style of living as -was obvious without, John Fane was presented to Agnes Dean, the former companion of -iip early days who was busily assisting one of her maids in preparing the table for the midday meal, and who came forward on the entrance of her father and the stranger. ' Here Agnes,' said Mr. Dean, ' here is a very old friend. John, this is my daughter Agnes. I do not suppose you recognise each otherPH ?., . . ... ' Hatdiy, father, but welcome to Mount Dean, Mr! Fane ; I trust you will make' a long stay.' ' Not very long, Miss Agnes. I suppose I shall be settling down on my own account soon/' ? '???' '' ???- ? 

 Agnes Dean was not considered a pretty girl ; but her face was one of those remark able for its self-contained look of intelli gence, calm and almost grave in its aspect. Her voice was rich and sweet, while her quiet self-possflssion absolutely sent a thrill through John Fane. She was business-like and exact in her ways and dealings, and held been, her father's constant companion ever since her twelfth year, wfien her mother died. Richard Dean had taught his daughter many things not in cluded in the ordinary feminine curriculum. He had only two children � Richard, better known as Dick, and Agnes. The former had been sent to England, to Harrow, and had graduated from thence to the Oxford University. At the age of 21 years he be gan to study for the law, and, as we have seen, had succeeded welL On the death of Richard Dean's wife Agnes was the only one left to 'him. She could not only ride her horse, but she could saddle, groom, and stable Tiit' if necessary. She could bring down a wild duck or pigeon with a gun, as well as cook and carve them. She would often oversee the workmen at their work, and ^discourse auch sense as to make their �are tingle. She could tell when to sell stock and; when to hold it, as she could check the housekeeper's weekly accounts. Hers was a large nature which could not satisfy itself with a life of jots and tittles. -� Did you meet with any adventures on the road Mr. Fane?' asked Agnes, after they had done ample justice to the meal set before them. 

 *? Nothing of any consequence, Miss Agnes, we had a very quiet journey. 'What a glorious plaee you have here, something . after the style of the old country. I 'was quite surprised to see such a large place in the bush. It is delightful after some of those fri'tia we had to put up at. The fur niture was of the most primitive description imaginable. There was one place just 12 miles this side of Bathurst. The table was made out of some old beer casks, benches of iron-bark tree, and for stools small blocks of lime stone did duty. The bedsteads equalled anything I ever saw 5 they corlsi&ted of two benches placed crossways, one at the head and the other at the foot. On these were placed slabs of -wood, then a layer of straw, and over that a blanket not particularly clean, which you may be sure we did not .attempt to use. There is some beautiful scenery in that direction. Have you ever been across the Blue Mountains, Miss Agnes?' ' I have not been further than Penrith, Mr. Fane.' ' Aa aoon as I Jtiave made up my mind, Mr. Dean,' said John Fane, ' as to what I am going to do, I'sEall look out for a spot up that way to squat on. It is jusi the kind of place I should delight to live in.' ** I trust you will not *-�tiTt o� leaving us for some ifcime yet, Mr.- Fane,' said Agnes. *' Your father has loudly undertaken to teach me sheep farming, MJfcs Agnes, and I am going to assist him in his work for a While.' � Toa tired, lad,' said Mr. Dean, rising, V to come and overlook those eweB required or Cooper, with David and myself f' 

 'Not a bit, Mr. Dean.' The two men then went off in the direction of the sheds, leaving Agnes alone. She stood watching them as they disappeared from her sight ; and her thoughts wandered away to the past � to the divn recollection of early' child hood, when they -were girl and boy together � in England. She had forgotten those days until Dick's letter had arrived, telling them of John Fane's conviction, and urging his father to do all he could for Tivm. He had reminded'^ his father of the obligation he was under to the late Mr. Fane ; how he had helped ''him in a monetary way to start life in Australia, though Richard Dean had long since -paid him back. He reminded him of how he himself had been treated as the late Mr. Fane's own son, during the holiday vacation at college, and of the weeks and months he had spent at Fayersham HalL Then came Dick's strong belief in John's innocence. And as Agnes thought of all she had heard and read concerning the crime John Fane was accused of, though the evidence against 

 him clearly proved his guilt, yet she could not believe him guilty. Now she had seen him, she was more than ever ready to be firmly persuaded as to his innocence. To her mind he was not a man who could be guilty of such a crime as murder. 

 ** There he sat with his can of strong billy tea, looking alternately at the^ grazing cattle and into the solemn gloomy woods.' 

 The property of Mount Dean was'-exten- | sive, and the land belonging to Richard Dean extended for 10 miles by 8 miles. It had the natural boundary of the River Hawkes bury on one' side. ' Richard Dean was con sidered one of the richest squatters in the district. He was a man of singular energy and indomitable perseverance, who had de voted all his powers of mind and body with ceaseless, unrelaxing obstinacy to what he was pleased to consider the main end of existence. By sheer hard work he had made a good station, and owned 10,000 head of cattle, 50,000 he�d of sheep, and a good balance at Tniia banker's. Daily Richard Dean would ride over part of the run, and look to his flocks and herds, his men and his improvements, his fences, wells, buildings, fields, and teams. After which he would devote his time to writing letters or to posting up station accounts, or else he would arrange the order for the fol lowing day, which consisted in drafting of sheep, shifting of shepherds, mustering of cattle, and bargaining with dealers. In all these he was greatly assisted by his daugh ter Agnes. CHAPTER XVIH. The Great Bush Fire, 1861. The year 1851 had been one of exceptional heat and drought in Australia, but especially in Victoria. Pastures had withered, creeks had become fissured claypans, waterholes had disappeared, sheep and cattle . had perished in great numbers, and the sun burnt plains were, strewn with bleached skeletons. The very leaves of the trees cracked, in the heat, and appeared. to be ae inflammable as tinder. As summer ad 

 vanced the temperature became torrid, and on the morning of February 6, 1851, the wind, which blew from the north, resembled the breath of a furnace. The air was darkened by volumes of smoke, relieved by showers of sparks. The forests were ablaze, and on' the ranges the confla gration transformed their wooded slopes into appalling masses of incandescent columns and arches. A fierce and violent wind blew from the north and north-west, and by some inexplicable means it wrapped the whole country in a sheet of flame� -fierce, awful, and irresistible. The impetuous onrush of the flames left nothing behind but heaps of charred ruins and a pitiable scene. Many lives were lost, valuable property and live stock destroyed, and such devastation as could never be effaced from the recollection of those who had witnessed and survived the* calamity that took place. From the bold promontory of Cape 'Otway, and for the space of 300 miles by 150 miles, and far beyond Goulbum, the Broken Bay River and the Ovens, there remained to be seen traces of the terrible bush fire which took place in February. of .the year 1851. ; . ^ For weeks and mpn^s, tjll the. kindly yping of autumn r-had; renewed the grass, people journeying throtfgli.iihtJ bush beheld lean and famishing cattle, unable to rise from the ground, and which by .faint bel lowings seemed to claim the pity and aid of man, 'Whole families -were destroyed ; soli tary travellers, flying through the boundless woods before the surging flames, had fallen and perished. ' ? .. : The. cause of the fire has .never, been known, but at the time of its outbreak there were many suppositions aa to its oaiiBOi One 

 of the causes, it was said, was due to a j farmer who fired his stubble. . The unanimous agreement of the farmers around the district of Kilmore ' was on Tuesday, February 4, to burn about 8000 acres of wheat and other stubble of the List year's crop, but on some account the burning was deferred. However, one of the farmers, it was understood, fired his stubble on the Wednesday just before the commencement of the gale, and to that may be attributed, in some measure, the exten sive loss sustained. The amount of damage done on Thursday, February 6, 1851� justly caused to be named Black Thursday- � can only be vaguely conjectured. Late in the evening of the 6th a strong sea breeze began to blow from the south, driving back the heavy pall of smoke that had deepened the darkness of the night, and the next day dawned upon blackened home-; steads, smouldering forests, charred carcasses of sheep, oxen, poultry, and wild birds, Aye ! and also upon human beings. * * * ? On the evening of February 5, on the out skirts of a foreBt, in a small grassy valley which is watered by a creek falling into the 'Western Barwar, in the country that lay between Lake Corangamite and Mount Gelli brand, in Victoria, a distance extending over six to seven miles, a young man. was camped. His dress was that of a stock 

 man, knee-breeches of moleskin, black riding boots reaching almost to the knee, a blue and white striped shirt, neatly fastened at the neck with a 'kerchief. John Fane, for it was he, had that xlay driven a herd of cattle from Mount Hesse, the station of a Mr. Carey, thus tar on his way towards the Emu Plains, on the western bank of the River Nepean, in New South 'Wales. Three years had passed since John Fane had purchased a sma.11 station and settled down. He had begun to like the free and easy life of the settler, but there -was one thing time had not cured � the thought of his ljLttle girl he loved so dearly, and his own blighted life. Fortune had favored him ; he was rich in Australian stock, he had -worked hard, and had learned in one year sufficient to enable him to start on Ti-ifi own account. 'With his own savings and what he had borrowed from Richard Dean he bought a place on the Emu Plains, and since then had doubled and trebled the money, paying back in less time than he had calculated old Mr. Dean his money. John Fane's mob of cattle, tired and hungry, were not inclined to stray from the rich pasturage before them ; and hob bling out his splendid black horse, Prince, he had prepared to pass the night in the simple fashion of the settler on such journeys. A fallen log supplied Tnrm with a convenient seat, a fire was quickly kindled from the dead boughs which lay plentifully around, and his quart pot, replenished at the creek, was soon hissing and bubbling, with its side thrust into the glowing fire. He had a goodly store of eatables, and there he sat with his can of strong ' billy tea,' looking alternately at the grazing cattle and into the ? solemn erlooniv woods, in -which the laugh 

 ing jackass failed to shout his clamorous adieu to the falling day. Only the distant monotone of the mopoke, the nocturnal cuckoo of the Australian wilds, reached John Fane's ear, making the profound solitude still more solitary ; and very soon, rolled in his rug, he flung himself down before the fire. . '. ..,'. . '.'.' ' . . ' ' ' '! ' ? Close by lay his trusty dogs, and Prince, in the favorite fashion of the bush horse, slept as he stood. The morning of Frbruary 6 was hushed and breathless, instead of that bracing chill with which the Australian lodger out of doors generally awakes. John Fane opened his eyes, and sat up to look around him, and the sweat stood thick on his face, while he felt a strange longing for a deep breath of fresh air. A deathlike and leaden heaviness hung around, not a bough or a blade of grass moved by the air. The trees stood moody and sullen, but motion there was none, except in the little creek that trickled with fresh and inviting aspect before him. He arose, and stripping, plunged into the deepest spot of it. , ...... Thus refreshed he rekindled bis fire, and made his breakfast. A sultry, suffocating density seemed to charge the atmosphere. The sky above him was dimmed by a grey haze. (TO BE CONTHniED.)
