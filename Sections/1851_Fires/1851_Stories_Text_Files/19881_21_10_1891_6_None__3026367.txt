THE STORY-TELLER. 

 ONE-EYED .DICK. 

 .BY A.R.G. 

 THERE were several of us in the party, and our ages were various, as also were onr experiences. We were quietly spend- ing the evening to a suburban house, not without those aids to conversation which men look for at a certain hour, and had in some way got into a rather aimless dis- cussion of the differences between Eng- lish and'Australian life. The discussion need not be reported, as there was abso- lutely .nothing novel put forward on either side, but it dropped-on agreeably and peacefully enough till someone rather weakly regretted the absence of romance in Australia, and especially in Victoria. There is no room for the imagination in a new country like this, he complained. A A country without tradition or association, or �ven a respectable ghost that any one ever heard of. 

 - Mow it happened that one of the partyr was ja man who had come to Australia before the goldfield influx, had been in . Ballarat in the days of Eureka Stockade, and had ^seen the desolation of Black Thursday, with -nany "other moving incidents of the olden days. He glanced .with some contempt at the lover of romanee, and spoke with decision. 

 ".Ghosts !" he said. For the matter of" that �expect Victoria has just as ma:-.y as any othbr coantrv, neither more nor -less!" ^ " ' 

 The other laughed. 

 "X aWt mean that I believe in ghosts," lie said, "-and I certainly never saw one myself, But it gives a place more interest! don't yon know, when there is a good ghost story connected with it. Now here X don't suppose there is a house that's old enough to be haunted." 

 " I've known a house given up because it was haunted, or a hut, any way. What do yon think of that ? That's as much as yon can say of any old castle in Europe." 

 ''"What, really haunted by a bona fide ghost ?" 

 " That I can't say. All I know is that not a man would stay in the hut, and it had to be given up in consequence. That's as true as I'm sitting here." 

 - " Well," he went ou, when we all wanted to hear about it, " I had a station in the early days iu partnership with an- other man. At that time fences were few, and we had to employ a number of shepherds. Each shepherd had a flock of sheep to look after, and a hutkeeper to look after him, as the huts were built wide aparf> on the mu. The men in those day� were often ' old hands ' from Sydney or the Derwent, and good men as a rule, so far as work went ; "not much given to nervousness any way. One day the man who took the rations out to the huts told us that there" was something very queer going OJ\\ at one of them, and that the shepherd and hutkeeper did not know what to make of it. For two or three nights they had heard queer noises which they could find no explanation for, and they were in a regular funk. We did not .think much of it at the time, but next morning the two men turned up at the homestead and swore that nothing "should make them go back to the hut." 

 "What had they seen?" someone asked. " Seen ?__Nothing ; it was just that that bothered them. All they could -tell 

 us was that'for'two or three hours in the 

 night there was a~ most tremendous| thumping and scratching outside the hut, with, every now and then, bangs, as if someone were throwiug large stones against the slabs. Of course we laughed, 

 and told them it must have been the limb, of a tree, swingjngrwith the wind. { 

 " 'It was a dead still night/ ono of them answered; 'and yon know well enoaghi there is not a tree withiu a hundred yards' of the hut.' ' 

 " *Tnt, tut,' "said my partner, � it waa native cats or 'pdasjims. They make the same noise here night after night.' , 

 " * 'Possums !' said the man. * Look here, boss. I've been in the bush fifteen years, and I reckon I know a 'possum' 

 . when 1 bear one." 

 " ' If Jt waa possums,' gmmbled^the other mau, 'the devil must have been inside of 'ora, so it don't make no odds.' 

 "Sayjwhat we would there was na persuading either of them that there was not something crooked going ou at the hut, so we sent a young ' jackeroo,' just ont from England, to sleep a night there and find ont what was the matter. He) of conrse,i laughed at the ghosts as much as we did, and was ready to go and stay as lo0"g*as~we liked. ' The hut was about * tea" miles from the homestead, and he 

 rode over in the afternoon, with a�rifle 

 1 and revolver, sayiug before he went thai bo would bring na the ghost'a scalp next day*- There� was nothing for him to do there, as the sheep had been moved.r He was back at the station by 7 o'clock Hext morning. He had not even waited 4o catch his horse, but started off just as he was and walked or run the whole way." ' "And had he heard the same noise ?" 

 "los, it was the same 6tory ; the noise began about' midnight, as the men had said. He caught up his rifle and went outside j the noise stopped. It was quite open ground and a bright moonlight night^but not a living thing- could, he see; be went bach, and the noise began again r worse. than ever, and he expected tho walls to cave in �every moment. The J secondtime he went out there was a wild 

 �ell of laughter, and then dead silence;; 

 � went, back �gain and lay on the bunk listening to the banging and thumying^on1 - the slabs, with his heart in hi3 mouth for 

 boars, and when the noised ceased at the first,8treak,�f dawh, he jumped upland made fpr home axi hard as he could go1; yon never saw arman in such a fright iii all your life. j 

 " After that -we hardly hoped to per- suade any of the meu to live in the lint, bat one of them came op and volunteered to slay there by himself as long as we liked. He was a notorious old ruffian generally known, as One eyed Dick, a small man, grey and wizeued, with a wicked looking face and character to match, thodgh he had been quiet enough and steady since-he had been with us. He chaffed tho other men in a grim sort of way�^bouHthenghosts, and said that the devil1 wastpp .old a friend of hi� �too do him any harm, and most of us agreed' with him. For : my part I thought he -would'be quite as bad company for the, ?* ghosts asthey^for him, but, as, we half 

 suspected that if was a trick of some �kind we �rave him a gan to defend himself, asid loft him at the hat with several days' 

 . tiona and J everything ; lie �wanted. I donVknow^what le-had been- ^lagged ' for originally; but it was supped to ha ve beari Wmathi�g pecn�i�rlyurn� and hewas^erfcaiitfyjthe lastiman to suspect of superstition or-calf fright, and wal �xpeotcd'that he would prove to many for, ^e ghosts.. - On the fourth morning, how* �y�r,'he was back. '"We'co��d not ^get much out of .bim, bat the point, of what he did say-was that he- stood it for three nights, and that nothing would take him to the place again. He had heard things fmdseen thing� in-that hukthat-were-too strong for him/ The other men.had only heard sounds/rbut-Dick-T had certainly seen, or fancied he had seen something.

 "Well, I did and I didn't. ; He ne^�r . turned, np at the station again, and IE don't remember hearing of him �from any of his mates, which was the^pnly. way Jone ever did hear of a man like that. But some years later I happened: to-her down in Melbourne, and was persuaded by the people! was. staying with to pay a visit to the Waxworks of those days.... For my part' I never cared particularly for that kind of entertainment, but I walked through the room with the rest, and after we had seen all the nsuaj celebrities we went through to the Chamber of Horrors. We were .> hardly inside : before Ivrcaught sight of familiar figure, and pulled np 

 short. 

 "Why, there's Dick !" Lsaid out loud, "One-eyed Dick!" And Dick it was, suire enough/ or rather Dick's likeness.

There wej fouud that he had been hanged a year^or two before for the murder of his, mate uni Bullarook Forrest. It;was a case that was a good deal spoken of at the ;time, though not so much perhaps as mnrd�rs are spoken �of as nowadays, and- jr:had1 heard and read about it�like everyone else, though I never knew, that the hero of it was One-eyed Dick;."-. >'..,:?."

 - " Thisjvas the story,'as far as 1 know it, A party of police-five or six trooper* -were travelling-up from1 MelhQurqeJto Ballarat. On the way'a very heavy storm came on, thunder aud lightning and rain, with a strong gale of wind. After sunset the wini, dropped slightly; bat' the, night Was still wild and dark as pitch, so dark that the troopers.good bushuien thonghthey were, gotl>fl the track completely, bat as their orders were to go np as quickly as possible, they kept pushing'on through rthe "darkness, ~ hoping that" they-were moving^ ia the right direction. At last, when it^ was "getting dose on midnight, they !�ad decided toVcamp till morning, as they were oaly knocking up their horses to no*purpose, aud,were just look- ing out for a good placo when they saw the light of a fire flickering through the trees some way ahead of them. They made Iheir way towards it, and, as they came near, saw by its light a little grey old man chopping something with an axe. .The wind was still high, and, as they moved slowly, the man'did not hear them till they caine within fifty yards of him. There' they polled np, thinking it strange that a man shouftl choose such a time of such a night to split wood, and watched him silently. After several blows, which sounded dull and-mufibd, as if the wood wasaeft and rotton, they saw_Jiim,_lay down his axe, pick np something which he had severed from the rest, and lay it on tho log blazing beside him. It was a man's head Before he could take the axe again, two troopers were-beside him, and two revolvers Were covering him. They used his fire for the camp that night,'aud wjienthey went on in the morning, he went with them. It was one-eyed Dick !" - -* Ugh ! what a bro fe ! Hanging was too good for him i"*~ 

 " Well, I don't know abont that;/there was a good deal to be said on Dick's side, ruffian though he .was._It seemsLthat Dick and his mate were ' splitters/ and as far as reputation and moralsigo, a^vpry well-matched pair, but the mate was� big strong man, and~whenever they got any liqnor, used to hammer Dick, who was small and a good deal older, within au inch of his life. Dick stood it for a long time, and was more than once very nearly killed, but at last he swore that he would put an end to it. He quietly waited his opportunity, knowing that there' was �- no hop-� of dissolving partnership without a fresh hammering, killed his partner with the axe; then set to work to get rid of the body in the easiest way, by cutting it np and- bnrriinjr it, as yon do a dead sheep or bollock. Of course this was legally a premeditated murder, and the disgusting 

 �way in which ha^tri 

 borpse made it all theiWorse,^butxmorally yea may say- that he-didit i&self^defence� �and burning the body, though moro re jvolting; was not more criminal tha�bary-: inglt. -- ----- ,-.??---;J.----;?.-��;.^.:L_r;j'-1',. *.� ! �* Anyhow,, the chances -were fever so' many to one that he would never have^ been csnght. -The place ^as! miles away �from any house, and a long way from 'any regular track� '.'.
