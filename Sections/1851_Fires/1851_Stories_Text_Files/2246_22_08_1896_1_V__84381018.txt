BLACK THURSDAY. 

 IN FIVE CHAPTERS. 

 CHAPTER V. 

 They came at length to the spot 

 where Turcen and George Maxwell had parted and the experienced bushman carefully sought out the tracks of his horses' feet, and followed them. These mainly obliterated 

 by the fire, or were unseen due to the rocky hardness of the ground ; but, through an indefatigable search, they found small signs of them, and were led at length to the edge of a deep and precipitous ravine. 

 In the ravine itself, the trees and grass remained unscathed as the torrent of fire had leapt over it, at the same time sweeping away every shrub and blade of grass from the heights. 

 " God defend us !" exclaimed Robert," the smoke most have blinded him and concealed this frightful place. Man and horse are doubtless dashed to pieces. 

 He raised a loud and clear cooee ; instantly answered by the wild sad clamourous barking of a dog which, in the next instant, was seen leaping and springing about in the bottom of the dell, as if frantic with delight. 

 " That is Snirrup !" exclaimed Turcen ; and the two men began to descend the steep side of the ravine. Robert Patterson outstripped his older and heavier companion. He seemed to fly down the sheer and craggy descent. Here he seized a bough, there a point of the rock, and, in the next instant, was as rapidly traversing the bottom of the glen. Snirrup the cattle dog rushed up to him, barking and whining as if in a fit of ecstatic madness, and then bounded on before him. Robert followed in breathless anxiety ; stopped the next moment by the sight of George Maxwell's horse, lying crushed and dead. Robert cast a rapid glance around, expecting every moment to see his friend stretched equally lifeless. But presently he heard the faint sound of 

 a human voice. 

 There lay George stretched in the midst of a grassy thicket, with a face expressing agony and exhaustion. Robert seized his offered hand and George called first for water. His friend started up and ran down the valley at full speed. He was soon back with a pannikin of water, which the sufferer drank with avidity. 

 He now learned that, as had been supposed, in the thick smoke the horse had gone over the precipice and was killed in an instant. George had escaped, his fall being broken by his steed and he was flung into a thicket, which softened the shock of his descent. But he had a broken leg and was extremely bruised and torn. Life, however, was strong within him; and Turcen and Robert lost no time in having a litter of poles bound together with stringy bark made soft with grass and leaves, laid in a sheet of the same bark. They had three miles to bear the shattered patient, to whom every motion produced excruciating agonies. It was not long before they heard people in different parts of the wood loudly cooeeing and their answers soon brought not only a number of men who had been sent out in quest of them, but also Miss Maxwell, herself. 

 

 We shall not attempt to describe the sad and yet rejoicing interview of the brother and sister, nor the rapidity with which the different men were sent off tied to the horses and taken to the surgeon who lived two miles off. 

 

 In a few days George Maxwell - his leg having been set and his wounds dressed - had become easy enough to relate all that had happened to him ; the dreadful night which he had passed in extreme agony in the glen, 

 and the excitement, when he heard Robert's 

 ringing cooees but was unable to reply. While his faithful dog had barked vehemently dog, who barked vehemently, it had seemed as if this was in vain. 

 From the moment of this tragic occurrence, Robert Patterson was constantly in attendance at the Mount with his friend. He slept in the same room with him, and attended with Ellen as his nurse in the day-time. From this moment the cloud which so 

 long hung over the spirit of Ellen 

 Maxwell had vanished. She was herself again ; always kind and open, yet with a mournful tone in her bearing towards Robert, which surprised and yet pleased him. It looked like regret for past unkindneas. As they sat one evening over their tea, while George was in a profound sleep in the next room, Ellen said, in a low, tremulous voice, " Robert. I owe much to you." 

 " To me ? " said Robert, hastily. " Isn't George as much a brother to me as to you ?" 

 " It is not that which I mean," added Ellen, colouring deeply, yet speaking more firmly; " it is that I have done you great wrong. I believed that you had said a most ungenerous thing, and I acted upon my belief with too much pride and resentment. 

 I was told that you had jested me as the daughter of a convict." 

 Robert sprang up. " It is false ! I never said it," he exclaimed. " Who could tell you such a malicious falsehood ?" 

 " Calm yourself," added Ellen, taking the young man's hand. " I shall tell you all." 

 " Hear me patiently ; for I must impress first on you the strange likelihood of what was reported to me. You were driven to a stockman's hut, it was said, by a storm�you and a young friend. You were very merry, and this friend congratulated you in a 

 sportive style on having won what he 

 was pleased to call the richest young woman in the colony. And with a merry laugh you were said to add, " and the daughter of the most illustrious of lags !" 

 Robert Patterson, with a calmness of concentrated wrath, asked, in a low measured tone: " Who said that ? " 

 " The woman who you lately saved with all her family. It was Nelly Fehan." 

 " Nelly Fehan !" said Robert in amazement; " what have I ever done to her that deserved such a stab ? " 

 " You threatened to send Fehan to prison for bushranging. You reminded him of his former life and unexpired expired sentence." 

 " That is true," said Robert, after a pause of astonishment. " And this was the deadly revenge�the serpents ! But, oh Ellen ! why could you not speak ? One word, and all would have been explained." 

 " I could not speak, Robert. Wounded pride silenced me. But I have suffered severely ; have been fearfully punished. I can only say�forgive me." 

 One long embrace obliterated the past. 

 The late Mr. Maxwell had been 

 transported for the expression of his liberal political principles in hard and bigoted times. There was not a man in the penal settlement, who did not honour his political integrity and foresight and who did not reverence his character. But the convicts as a body were proud to claim him as of their class, though sent thither only for a crime of a Hampden or a Sidney. Whenever reproach was thrown on the convict section of society, the insulted party pointed to the venerable exile, and triumphantly hailed him as their chief. No endeavours, though they were many, and conducted by powerful hands, had ever been able to procure a reversal of his sentence. The injuries of a man of his high talents and noble nature might be comparatively buried in the antipodes ; at home they would be a present, a perpetual and a damaging reproach. He had lived and died a banished, but a highly-honoured man. Still, as he rose to a higher estimation and an unusual affluence, there were little minds who delighted occasionally to whisper - " After all, he is but a lag." And it was on this tender point that the minds of his children, whose ears such remarks had reached and wounded, had become morbidly sensitive. 

 Amid the general calamity, this reconciliation was like a song of thanksgiving in the generous heart of Robert Patterson, and quickened it to tenfold exertions in alleviating the sufferings of his neighbours. His joy was made boundless and over-flowing by a circumstance which appeared to be little short of a miracle. When Robert rode up to his own station, he beheld his mother�not seated in her wheeled chair�but on foot ; light, active, and alert, going to and fro amongst the people whose destitution still kept them near her house. The mass of misery that she saw around 

 her and the exertion which it stimulated 

 burst the paralytic bonds which had enchained her for years. The same cause which had disabled her limbs had restored them. 

 The conflagration had extended over a space of three hundred miles by a hundred and fifty, and far away beyond the Goulburn, the Broken Biver, and the Ovens, we have witnessed the remaining traces of its desolation. Over all this space, flocks and herds in thousands had perished. Houses, ricks, fences and bridges had been annihilated. Whole families had been destroyed. Solitary travellers, flying through the boundless woods before the surging flame, had fallen and perished. For weeks and months, till the kindly rains of autumn renewed the grass, people journeying through the bush, beheld lean and famishing cattle, unable to rise from the ground, and which by faint bellowing seemed to claim the pity and aid of man. Perhaps no such vast devastation ever fell on any nation and Black Thursday is an indelible memory in Victoria. 

  

 The End.
