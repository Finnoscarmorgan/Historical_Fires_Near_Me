 Before leaving homo 011 hie trip ta Mel bourne with tho Block (or market, Arthur L&ndon bad been commissioned by his father and Hale; lo ongago n tutor for the children of both Inmiliau. Thin needful person he found in a young man whoso age could not exceed IwoDty, nnd who had been ono of Jaok Tantrum's driycra.liow Jack felt in with 

 tbia person was & mystery to Arthur, for he appeared1 far superior to either Jaok, himself, or his other men, who were of the usual rough type ol Australian stockmen. The young fellow, jpbose namewas Frank Aoatey, seemed to have seen better days both by ap pearance, conversation and manners. The other drivers took every opportunity of in sulting and keeping him under, calling him by several nioknames suoh as "Gentleman stockrider," 11 Swell stookman," and other epithets. Frank Anstey bore all these in sulting inuendoes with meekness, until they diBpoaed of tho stock. Then, on hearing Arthur-who beoame a great favorite of his mention about finding a teaober.be proflerred his services. On finding out that Jack Tan trum bad no binding agreement with Anstey, Arthur engaged him at onoe. But when Jack heard of the engagement he beoame greatly enraged. This oonduot on the part of Tantrum surprised Arthur, as Jack's oon duot towardaAiiBtoy bad always been tyranni cal, and as evidonoing oarcleBanesB about bis services. Our hero consequently guessed there muBt be some mystery connected with the termB between tbe parties, as Jack held several private consultations with tbs young man, pressing on him, apparently, to renew biB engagement with himself, But this Anntey refused stubbornly, when the? former exclaimed with a terrible oath-seeing him 

 determined: 

 u Never mind my young puok, I snail oe upsides with you ons ot these days." 

 Anetey appeared a little alarmed at tbe threat. However, he seemed resolved .on getting dear of tbe bold dealera's toils* 

 Arthur questioned the young man several times as to his engagements with his former employer, and where Jaok'a station-the "Horseshoeu was situated-a mystery which no person in Maneroo could solve-neither ol whioh questions would Anstey answer, which left Arthur etcil more purpriscd. ^ 

 We will now give the reader all the infor mation in our power regarding Jaok Tan trum up to this timo. Ho was cne of those sharp buBhtnon who raise themselves from stockmen to dcalc-rs in cattlc and horses. Jack was first suRpeoted of earning the greater part of his income by hiding or *'planting" stook in those wild and unfre queuted gullies among tho Alps, and when ever rewards were offered for those "strayed 14 lost" cattle, be was sure to bring them to M light," and, as a matter of oouree, claim the reward, Several euspeoted persons had been found out and convioted for these offenccs, but Tantrum was too 11 knowing," and "wideawake" to-be caught, besides being the most experienced rider and bush man in tbe colonies. He was also suspected of " duffing " or changing brands, but even ; that-charge was never proved against bim. 

 If bo had done so, the knowing ones deolared it mudt have been done so " neatlythat be oould never be " balled out. There was one ! suspicious characteristic about bis stook that 

 tbey were all branded afresh with a horse shoe, from under which some sharp-eyed people could discern obliterations of original : brands. Notwithstanding all these declara 

 tions, Jaok sailed as yet dear of the law, and carried on bis profitable speculations 

 without interruption. 

 In looks and person be was ja very smart and attractive young fellow, with all tbe ac complishments of a real bushmau. His : language inoluded all tbe Australian bush 

 slang,but be was nevertheless, a witty and an aggreeable oompanion. 

 His bsat, or those parts in which he oar ried on bis trade, ranged through Maneroo, < Twofold Bay, Gippsland, Melbourne, and ' Adelaide, following down the Murray through 

 the Darling country. Sometimes he would take a trip to Queensland, and, occasionally, to Sydney, so that be bad travelled all over the colonies in his timo. When asked where his 44 bit ot a run " (as he termed it), tbe " Horseshoe," was situated, tbe answer was 

 llwaya: 

 .. Oh, it is only a bit ot sorubby country among tbe mountains." It seemed evident, however-although no person kuew of its whereabouts-that it could not be far distsst from Landon and Haley's runs, lor Jaok and bis drivers invariably passod through these on bis way to and from Melbourne and Gippsland. Another peculiarity about bis affaiiQ was that he always had the same men, ; who seemed to have an interest or Bhare in 

 tbe transactions carricd on bp bim, and, by all appearanoe, they lived # in perfect har mony and understanding with one another. 

 Arthur L&ndon and they did not seem to pull together very well dunng their late trip, and the engaging of Anstey widened the broach between himself and Tantrum still more, which the former bad no objeotion to, sever liking the forward and suspicious dealer's mode ot carrying on badness, fie, therefore, resolved to drive his own stock to 

 market for the future. 

 On arriving at home, the family greeted Mm with joy after so long an absence, and tbe small preeents he brought from Mel bourne for each member were gratefully re 

 ceived. 

 Next morning, according to custom, be rode over to Haley's with Kathleen's gift ol books and other little articles, whioh were this time more valuable than usual, ooming ! from Uie grand city of Melbourne, and, on 

 arriving, be was surprised to hear that Jack j Tantrum had been there tho night previous, ! and only lefta few minutr before. Thisnewi 

 puzzled him the more, as ' .. understood be lore be left Melbourne, the: the horse-dealer intended starting by the Mney-road round tbe Murray, but now he must have followed himself and Anntey closely on their heels. 

 Kathleen was in eostaoies on the reoeipt ol her valuable presents, and also the arrival ol | the doner. Arthur proposed to take the 

 customary ride through the run to see the stock,whioh had been negleoted sinoe he left, to whioh suggestion Kathleen agreeably con 1 sented, and, fcooordingly,"Kate Karney, her | favorite steed was Instantly saddled and i bridled, ,, ... . 

 It was a pretty sight to see the youthful pair sstting out on this pleasant ride," Kate Karney " prancing Bud rearing with impa tience, while her beautiful rider graoefutly moved with eaoh bound, and gently curbed her mettled steed, while Arthur craoked his long whip as be oantered by her side to gather his cattle-hie kangaroo dogs round them. Kathleen's silvery and merry faugh at the pleasant prospeot of a long ride oould be heard ringing on the morning breeze, while her cheeks glowed and her brillisnt eyes sparkled, illuminating her lovely lace. Arthur oould Eat take bis eyes on her, and wondered at his own stupidity that he never before now observed her many charms, whiob so oomplstely eolipsed all tho Melbourne beautios ho had eecn. Kathleen �rteoted him so often looking at her, and not intei preting the reason, her cheeks became more deeply colored, when she observed 

 .' Why do you look at me BO hard Arthur l I suppose you see me so ooarse and ugly after 

 the fine Melbourne ladies?" . 

 ?' You are neither ooarse nor ugly, Kath leen : but I oannot help seeing the great chango in yon sinoe I lelt. Ton are really a Br�'wdf weu! Arthur I that is really rich I a grown up woman? How could I grow UP a woman In two months elnoe you left ? It is only an exouse o! yours to Isay that you don't like to teU me that I am vulgar looking alter the fashionable town ladies. 

 "You are perfeotly mistaken, Kathleen. You are far more natural, and a ootiog in my eyes than the artificial, starohed and 

 t&0''Ia0not0yoIuraLlEsy faVnioeraod ginteeler 

 10 �8he ia very^retty, I think; but a brother 

 Is no judge, ebe is not ao tall or good-looking to my fanoy as you are, Kathleen. 

 i " Now, now, Arthur, thai is too muob. I 

 50 

 (ball think yoa are flattering like Jaok Tan tram lBot night." 

 '. I never flatter, Kathleen, I am telling my mind only." 

 " Yes, I ssppossso. How nicely I wonld look this moment if I wero galloping through Mel bourne streets and oracking my whip. They wonld soon put me in the madhouse." 

 This ridioulous idea and remark o( the ively Kathleen made the pair laugh so heartily that the sound o( their merriment jranR through the gully and rangeB around. 

 Altera while Arthur remarked with more anxiety than usual, " What was that you said about Jaok Tantrum flattering you?'' 

 " So he was, the nanty fellow. I hato that man. What do you think ot his iinpudenoe offering; mo a lot ot presents he brought from 

 Melbourne? The same as if I would take his trash." 

 " What did you say to him, Kathleen ?" 

 111 told him that I did not want his pre sents, and that yon were bringing everything f wanted. But just fanoy what he said? 'OhI' nays he, <1 oan afford better than Arthur Landon to give presents;" but I made 

 him wild when I answered that they were' more acceptable from you." 

 " I am very glad you said so, and also that you refused his presonts,forl do not think he is a proper person. I'll never again travel with him; something tells me that be iB not honest in bis dealings." 

 " I felt thjnine suspicion towards him, 

 and, altbongh he seems to be a pleasant 

 person in oompany, I feel myself tremble every time he speaks to or looks at me. I oannot make out the reason, but somehow I feel afraid of his looks." 

 " Well, Kathleen, be is a good looking fellow yoa mnst admit, far better looking ana oieer than I am." 

 "Not to my fanoy, a.mur; other people might think eo." 

 Thus the pair chatted away while tbey walked their horses down a long valley to wards some waterholes where they intended to give their horses a drink and some rest during the heat of the day. They now changed the subject of their conversation, and Arthur gave his eager listener a detail of all his adventures since be left. The incident of Black Thursday interested his fair eompanion very muoh ; and above ill, the novelties and plays he attended and witnessed in Melbourne. 

 On arriving at the water holes they turned their horses loose, and eat down themselves utder the shade of a oherry tree, when Arthur renewed the Interesting eobjeot of play acting, and reheareed several parts and passages whioh his well stored memor .applied bim with. Both were so muoh taken op with the aubject that Kathleen begged Arthur to aot a email part in order to give her an Idea how it was performed. 

 Arthar, eager to comply with her request, proposed to introdnoe a small part of his favorite play, " fiomeo and Juliet," and, ai be rememberd several passages in that pieoe, 

 be of oonrse aoted Borneo while Kathleen deoked her hair with wild flowers to represent tbe Juliet, and we question whether the original oharaoter oould surpass the beauti ful bash girl in loveliness or looks. 

 The part which Arthur undertook was that portion of Aot 1 in eoene fifth, when Borneo 

 and Juliet first met in her father's house. Arthur eucoeeded well with his rehearsal, patting Kathleen through her part also, antil 

 heoame to those words: 

 Borneo. - " Then movo not; while my 

 prayere' effeot I take, 

 Thns from my lips, by thine, my sin is 

 purged." [KiSBing her. | 

 Arthur in tbe excitement of the moment considering it his bounden dnty to go through the performance, kiseed Kathleen's lips before die had time to consider the act, and when they felt tbo warm pressure, both blushed with confaBion, which, as may be 

 supposed, brought tbe play to a sudden 

 termination, as this was the first time that their bad lips met. 

 Kathleen was the first to speak after this uckvatfl interruption, saying: 

 " Oh why didjou do that t" 1 �si3-neidea_ 

 that was a part orit." 

 " I forgot myself at tho moment with tbe excitement and imitating the actors in Mel bourne," replied Arthur with some con 

 fusion. 

 " Buely the women on tbe stage would not aot that part before the pnblio ?" 

 " 01 oourse they do, because it is part of tbe play, Katbtoen." 

 At this moment the dogs began to bark, wbicb interrupted the would-be Rotors, and, on their looking in tbe direction whioh the dogs took, tksy beheld to their mortification Jaok Trantrum riding slowly on the opposite side ot tbe waterhole, being, no doubt, a 

 spectator ot their ridioulous per(ormanoe in 

 the wild forest. 

 "Ohmy graoiouswhat a shame 1" burst from jjoor Kathleen, nearly dropping with 

 oonfueion. 

 "Bother, it is rather awkward. That fellow will be everywhere where not wanted,'1 added Arthur, quito annoyed at his own im propriety. 

 .' He'll tell it all our the country f 1 wish (had not left home," exolaimed Kathleen hi great trouble.* 

 "I'll novsr ask yon to ride with me again Kathleen if you are so very much annoyed at my kissing you. We are not the first tbat have done so," remarked Arthur, with some disappointment and bitterness in his voice; tor something ltke jealousy seised him at that moment, seeing Kathleen 40 inuoh vexed at Trantum catching her in the act. Poor Kathleen hung down her head, and her eyes oould not meet those ot hor companion for the first lime in her life. Arthur, soeing hor oonfusion, his noble tieut melted at once, and hn noflly added: 

 " You are not angry, KMUlecn, at my kiss ing you ?" 

 " No, Arthur, it was only for that fellow seeing us. He may think we are always going 

 on eo." 

 "Never mind, Kathleen, we'll never give aim the chance again. We will start for 'ionic at once." 

 With that Arthar oaught the horses, helped Kitlilcen in tbe eaddle, and, while placing ber habit properly round her, he beheld her oheoks still mounted with crimson, while her looks evaded bis gaze. He wondered that sha still felt annoyed at him, as he thought, nor could she reply to hiB conversation with out a tremor in her voice, so that very little talk .passed between them oi. their homeward 

 ride. 

 On arriving at her father's house, and wbon helping her out ot the saddle he felt her tremble in his arms, and lean heavier than usual upon him, while a sigh escaped her, not as in former days whan Bho invari ably sprang to the ground without his as sistance. In placing ber on tbe ground this day he whispered in her cars lest any of tbe family should overheat them, and think ing Bhe was still annoyed at his mistake. 

 "Tell me, Kathleen, ate you still Bngry 

 with me?" 

 "No.no, Arthur I but I feel so strange now when you touch me," she replied, in a low key. 

 Poor innocent ohildrenl little did.-they imagine the eHeots of that first and unpre mediated kiss. It was on hiB way home to his father's house, that Arthur bo came aware of the eudden transformation in his feeling towards Kathleen. Her unrivalled beauty beoame - more apparent as he dwelt upon her image. That eoft and mUBical whisper sha epoke in bis ear when inbis arms was sweater than all the musio he ever heard. The delightful thrill which the pressure of hor pouting her lips seafcthrough his heart still vibrated in his vefifi, The joyful girl of the morning ohugeSin one instant into a loving and 

 beautiful woman. Butwbat were Kathleen's feeliugs during thin time 1 Her m uihtr won dercdat thodaughter'e.apparent i *]?. r(;; mid quietness. Kathleen, without her babit as usual, satin Jjcr room \\\\iiii it;- uuur closed. Her eyes gazed fortli inti. \\uc-nr-y,und a stilled sigh would encape her now hi.I1 !h< n. Wuat strange sensations pau'ed ihrnu -!i l.er heart since that moment when Auliui Blips touched her'a? Was there witchcraft in the kiss whiah caused suoh unaccountable fccliu^s; or was it a mesmeric influenco that was in Arthur's touch ? She had read, And heard Arthur describe that morning, the extraor dinary powers of the professor of electriobi ology whom he saw performing in Melbourne* Cunld Arthur have that i;i :'t which mvJc her so passive in his arms, when ho agisted her off the horse, and, above all, that Lijs which she still felt on her lips ? S.ie coul.) not comprehend the reason that made 1^0r now so shy to look into his face. 

 Thai the oommuned with her own. thoughts, when her mother called from the 

 next room: 

 ?' Kathleen, my honey, are you ill ? What . is the matter ? I hope you had no fall ?" 

 "Oh sot all, my dear mother; I only feci a littlo tired," replied Kttlileon, evasively, with a slight tremor in her soft voice. 

 " I'm sure there is something the matter with you, my child, I know by your voice You should not ride out thepn hot days, for fear of getting a BUQBtioke," added the anxious parent; but her daughter made some exouse which quietened her mother's apprehensions. If that lady but knew tbat the real oause of ber daughters ailment was, Arthur's kisB she would have indulged in a hearty langh; for many a time she had been treated in the same manner bereelf in her Dative land by the " boys " when a girl, and nover thought of it the next moment. It was the oustom there, but not so in the bush of Australia. Kathleen had never been treated with suoh familiarity before, and the ifToot of it caused a strange revolution in hex feel ings, which no one but those who have ex perienced sensations produoed by a virgin embrace could understand. 

 Instead of being annoyed at it as poor Arthur had imagined by Kathleen's singular conduct and quietness, the more she thought on the action, the more sacred and delight ful it seemed to her mind. She oould still feel the sweet tonoh on her lips and tingling through her nerves, and came to the fesolu tion not to taste food or drink for some time lest the oharming sensation should bo ob literated from het lips. 

 These innooent ideas may seem ridiouloos and childish to the Wiirl nj iguomit oi hp veneration held by Uk innctent child of nature towards the first kiss of love.
