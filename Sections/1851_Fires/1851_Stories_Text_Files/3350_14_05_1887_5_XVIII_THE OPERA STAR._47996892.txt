Cl�ArTER XVIII. 

 tat ona* nu. 

 It will ba sm by the undents in the pn ceding chapter that oar hero had been baffled by the wily Jack Tantrum in the two 

 material objects which bad occupied all his | mind ol late. These were the recovery of Frank Anstey'a private documents and ob- taining Jack's old boots and tbs hone's 

 shoes. However, Arthur gained mon evi- j dence, and added another link to the proofs j and suspicions already created in his own 1 

 mind against the daring hone-dealer, and 

 his evident guilt in making away with tbs 

 lovely Kathleen. 

 His only coarse now was to persevere in his search for the body, or some traces of it ; bat, alas, notwithstanding his own and Bulgar Jack's assiduity, not another addi- tional vestige or trace conld they find. 

 These constant searches convinced our hero more and more, together with Bulgar Jack's first opinion, and also the off-hand and indifferent manner with which Jack Tan- 

 trum treated the matter, that the latter, al- , though a bold and cunning character, was not actually guilty of murdering the inno- cent girl, but bad most likely carried ber oft to the mountains where his supposed Horse- shoe Station-was. And, in that case, he had most likely compelled her by threats to be- come his wife. These thoughts, although galling to his own honorable and constant mind, wen nevertheless associated with vague hopes which partially relieved the dreadful apprehensions which weighed him down, under the impression that his ador- able Kathleen had been barbarously mur- dered. 

 Under these conflicting suspicions, he thought of once mora rousing himself to action and, by attending to his former sail- ing, to drive away the melancholy which I weighed upon his mind, as his lamented 

 affianced was apparently lost to bim for- ever. He had given up dealing and attend- ing the Victorian markets ever since the fatal trip on which he was brought back a pri- soner on a charge of murder, and wM^becom iag every day mon anxious to leave that part of the country which constantly broaght to his sorrowful mind the recollections of happier days, and the scenes of his happy boyhood in tho company of tbs sweet girl who was now lost to him foe ever. He ac* eordingly,with the consent of his parents^ook another trip to Melbourne foi the purpose of looking oht for a larger and mon convenient station in Victoria; as their capital now amounted to a considerable sum through Arthur's eueeessful dealings in stock for some yean. On this occasion he brought to market a larger herd both of cattle and horses, as be determinad it to bc thc laa� apee or transaction in that trade. 

 Arriving at bia destination safely, and dis- posing of all his stock to advantage,be visited the bank in which his capital had been de- posited, and to have a chat with his oil friend Pembroke, whom he had not seen for the last three yean. On the manager seeing our hero, he called bim to bis private office, and than related to him soma news which filled him with surprise and disappoint- 

 ment. 

 Thu wMnolen than that his supposed friend and acquaintance, Pembroke, had that very day absconded, and carried away a consider- able sum of money belonging to the bank, 

 and also soma of Arthur's own funds. 

 Tbs manager .also, in answer to our han's inqoiries^aii that he had himself entertained averyl confidence until now-in the honesty and trustworthiness of the defaulter, and tbs only reason he could assign for Pembroke's delinquencies was that the unfortunate young man bad become of late enamoured of and according to 'report-entangled with a new star and a famous vocalist belonging to an Italian opera company lately arrivai in Mal 

 bourne. 

 These wen the sad tidings which awaited Arthur on his coming to town, tidings which would now disarrange his plans, as this loss would prevent him from entering on bis in- tended transactions in purchasing another station. This was the first peeaniary loee ha had met with, and which, added to hi� other gnat loss, instigated him to imbibe for the first tims somewhat freely in wins in order to drown bis mdaneholly. 

 I Finding himself in better spirits through 

 than false stimulants in company with other young squattera of his acquaintance, he ac companied them, aa a matter of coona, to opera, in in order to hear and see the cele- 

 brated star and beauty, who was the them� of Urorenal conversation. Having taken a convenient seat near the stage, with a few of his companions in the same box, they awaited the appearance of the young lady. 

 The box in which Arthur was seated was situated on one Bide of the stage, so that al- though near, he conld only ase the fair singer's profile. Then wu something in tba voice of the oantatrice.however^nd soma other tatures which brought to bis mind remem- brance ol soma like sound and looks, but it was not until she faced round towards tbs side be occupied and her brilliant eyes wen for a moment fixed upon bim that his sus- picions wen verified. 

 Then indeed stood before lum, in ba gorgeous attire, bespangled with brilliant stan and Taluable jewels aettting forth bet queenly beaaty, the little Nins he had sand from the flames on Black Thursday, now de Tel oped into a lovely woman* Twice sba tamed her gaze on him, and each time her voice seemed to acquire a mournful cadence not in accordance with tho part intended, bat as if inspired by some extraneous feelings. Tbs audience seemed both charmed and puzzled ; but mon so when she turned her face and eyes toward tbs other side of the stage, fixing them on one of the stage boxee in which sat a matronly female. In an in- stant ehe moved her looks gently round again to Arthur, which look broke down her last powers of restraint, and bas mellow voiee waa choked by broken sobs. 

 The manager flew to har assistance and led her from the stage, while she held ber handkerchief convulsively to ber eyes, both [ duappearing behind the scenes. Then waa 

 a visible stillness among the audience, save 

 j stifling sobs among tbs females, whose feel ' ings the mteresting and melodious singer had 

 i visibly carried away. 

 i The manager soon mads his re-appearanee, I apologizing for the break down of the favorite I voealist^nd pleading an exouse that she was 

 indisposed that night, but was sun to appear every other evening. 

 Arthur Landon, who bad nneonsaously been the object of universal scrutiny-as many eyes and glasses wen levelled at him -was in a state of bewilderment as if mes* mensed. He instinctively followed Nina's eyes to the other box on the opposite side of the stage, when he beheld Mrs. Whitford Nina's old guardian-who on seeing her former charge retiring from the stage over- come with her feelings, herself withdrew hurriedly Thia convinced Arthur that Nina 

 most likely stayed with her former friend. He theref on resolved on repairing to his old quarters, as he had not called as yet then, having been staying at one of the leading hotels along with other squatters. He had, however, some difficulty in riddm g himself of his companions, as they teased him unmerci- fully for the marked notice the fair Nina had taken of htm, and also pressed bim with questions whether they had met before, and nuder what cirenmstanees, aa they wan under the irnpnsthm that this wu har Aral

 Effects of Inebriety.-Wa see many in stances of tbe remarkable brevity of a man's respectability wben be ia once fairly launched on the sea of inebriety. His coarse to tbe lowest depths of degrade lion is by ewift and aore degrees. He commences imbibing a little when engaged in a position of fr oat v;J profit. His superiors notice it, end he is rey ' manded for it. Soon he lays eff from 'SA j not being in a fit state to attend, aod this occurs BO often that at last he is discharged. He then gives way entirely to the appetite and ?pends every cent in liquor. Ile becomes ashamed to look for employment, and pawns his watch, ring, and whatever other articles he may possess, the proceeds of these joining the rest. He nrxt visits a second hand shop and exchanges hie good clothes for poor ones and a little money. This money gone be visita another second hand establishment and again trades for worse clothes and some " boot." He keeps on at this until finally be is clothed in snob rags that he can trade no more. He is then a total wreck, and would never be re- cognized as the gay, refined, and highly re- spectable yoong man ot tbe few months before. I have known several caees eimiliar to that, and almost all of them have commenced merely through a desire to be sociable. 

 Homing Pigeons--An enormous flight of pigeons, consisting of some seven hundred or eight hundred birds, took place at Dover, England, On the morning of August 30, for a race from that place to Brussels. The birds were brought over in baskets, which formed part of the deck cargo of the Oatend mail packet. The pigeons belong to different Bel* gian societies, and were flown in connection with the Society of Sana Peur, of Laaken, near Brussels. The start was a very interest- ing sight. The channel being fairly clear, the baskets were placed in tiers on the quay, the flaps on a given signal were let down, and simnltanoonaly tba hirds im like a eloud, and after circling in the air for a moment, beaded southward and made off in the direc- tion of Calais, all being well away within the space ot two minutes. A similar raoe ia be- ing arranged from London to Brussels. Some five hundred birds, trained to act as mes- sengers in oase ot war, and belonging to dif- ferent societies in and around Paris, were also recently flown from Dover to Paris. As our readers probably know, the training and fly* ing of pigeons has become the national sport in Belgium. Almost every family has a pigeon chamber in the upper part of the house. Foot- ball in Australia is nothing as compared with tba homing pigeon sport in Belgium. 

 The Books Balanced Perfectly.-The cashier of a business place bad occasion to leave bis desk one day, and he called the son of tbe proprietor, who was at work in another department, to take his place for an hour or two, and instructed him about how to make entries in the cash book, in case any money came in, the receipts on one side and tbe disbursements on the other. The boy's father wanted ten shillings which the son 

 gave bim, and when the cashier came back . he found an entry in the cash book. On one 

 side was this: 

 " Took in ten shillings from a granger with his panta tucked nuder bis boots." 

 The cashier looked at the scrawl In the book and then at the cash drawer, and 

 said, 

 � Well, where's the ten shillings f " 

 The boy thought a minute, took a pencil 

 and wrote on one side of the book, 

 " Pa collected the ten shillings." " 

 The cashier sighed and the buy said, 

 " Well, it balances, does'n it. What more do you want 7" 

 Presence of Mind--On a river boat tba passengers bad crowded all on one. side, so much so that progress waa impeded. It was almost impossible to move them, they wera ao numerous, so tbs captain sung out< "Collins, you must get the crowd on the other side 1" " Ay, ay, air 1" and immediately on that side was heard the cry : " Han over- board 1" The crowd rushed over to see, the boat righted, and the captain, with a laugh, said. " Well done, Collins 1" 

 Flowers at Funerals.-He had been in only tolerable circumstances-dependent on hie weekly ealary. Tet at hie fanerai the "Gates Ajar," tbe "Broken Pillar," the "Croea and Crown," the "Sheaf of Wheat" and another invention of the florist, the "Vacant Chair," were all there. Enough money had been spent in the useless and orientation things to keep the dead man's tamur for M>�al months. His coffin waa 

 piled high with" Wal emblems, ' and twenty firs earnages waited wound the comer to join the regolited six that ^ permitted to stand before the church door. This was a pleasing way of " getting ahead of ti* priest," who had wisely forbidden that more carnages than tba half doran should attend any ot his parishoners' fanerais. The next week tb� friends ot tbs descasad were engaged in arranging a collection for the procuring of a sewing-machine for-so the printed card of appeal said-" a starring family.'' 

 Betrothal Customs in Russia.-When a couple ara engaged in Basaia a betrothal feast is bald and the bride-elect has a lock ot hair cut off in the presence of witnesses. This is given to the bridegroom, who in return presents a silver ring with a tur- quoise, an almond cake, and a gift of bread and sali, From this moment the two are plighted, nor can the relatives break off the match except with the consent of the be* trothed pair, which is signified by the return of the lock of hair and ring. So much im- portance is attached to the ring-at least in the north of Russia-that, among poor people who cannot afford silver and turquoise, tin and a bit of bins stone ate substituted. These betrothal rings are kept as heirlooms, 

 and must not serve twice. 

 The Deceased Kings of Ceylon--in Ceylon, formerly, after barning tbe bodies ol the deceased kings of Kandy, their ashes were carried by a man in a black mask to tba Maha walli Ganga, where he embarked in a canoe. At the deepest part of the river he clove the vase with a sword, scattered the ashes on the stream, and, plunging headlong siter them, dived, arose near the opposite bank, whence he fled into the forest, and was presumed to be never more seen. The canoa was allowed to drift away, the horse and ele- phants that accompanied the procession were set at liberty in the woods, and the women, who had strewed rice over the remains, were transported across the river and forbidden to 

 return. 

 Boy Pictures--Get pietures if you can. Nothing ia more melancholy, particularly to a person who ha3 to pass much time in his room, than blank wallsend nothing on them, for pictures ara loopholes 'of esoape for the soul, leading it to other scenes and other spheres. It is such an inexpressible relief to some persons engsged in writing, or even reading, on looking up not to have his line ot vision stopped short by an odious bare wall, but to find his soul escaping, as it were, through the frame of an eiquiaite picture to other beautiful and, perhaps, ldyllio scenes, where the fancy of a moment may revel, re freshed and delighted. 

 ArMflfft�! Eyes--It is stated that French Burgeons have sueeeded in replacing glass eyes with thefront perts of rabbit's eyes. The coat is stitched fast to the ball of a sightless 

 human eye, and made to adhere, so that it - causes no further trouble and looks as well as the natural eye. It is, ol course, sight* lass, but it ii far less bother than a glass
