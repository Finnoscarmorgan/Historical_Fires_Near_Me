A TALE OF BLACK THURSDAY. 

 BY GERA-LD GORDON. 

 CHAPTER II. . . 

 THEBE was a sweet fvesL* smell in the air the dew lay on the grass, 'and brushed from the overhanging brandies as the men passed. For some miles great trees overarched the ro�d, afforded a grateful shade. Then there were miles of oj>en, sunbaked country, where the long, pale grass looked golden as the sun touched it, and where log fences choked with bracken offered a haven for great black or brown BDafceS; and showed every here and there on blackened logs bright eyed, startled lizards. Tliere were inches deep of soft, prey dost, which in winter would be char ned . to mad, rendering the road almost imp amiable. A few nights after, Bupper was eaten in . the Macedou district, the camp being pitched on the banks of a creek,- and the two boys, being thoroughly wearied out by tlie long tramp, went to bed directly after. It .was perfectly still, the moon showed behind the foliage of ; a couple of-, splendid white gums, turning their smooth boles into silver, and reflecting itself in shattered ontline in the running waters of the little creek. The' men produced an . old concertina, and <Smith, the cook, proceeded to grind out Annie Laurie, while the others listened-' apprec iatively. Pollock strolled away some little distance, to where his horse was grazing. The animal lifted its head as he approached, and gave a little whinny of recognition, and a>� he ran his hand along under the thick ! dark mane, it nuzzled against him in ex 

 pectancy *of the biscuit he often tinies carried in his pockpt. He was a somewhat slightly built man, hut carried himself well, and his shoulders were broad, and his limbs muscu lar. He was. well liked, and by the men ? perhaps a little feared. He was fond of his 

 work, and hud on various occasions been . complimented on it at the head office. He 

 was anxious1 now for the.morning to see the lay of the country, and as lie: looked about , lrim he drew a long breath of satisfaction. He was pleased with his prospects and with his party of.men; they were all excel lent worker#, and even the two probationers, . whose hands ?'were'"soft, and had not yet 

 'overcome the exuberance of mischievous spirits natural to schoolboys, gave-him, so far, no cause for complaint. But there was something he -tried to avoid thinking of; ' something which, for months had affected 

 him deeply, and; no>v without apparent reason had invaded his thoughts. Possibly it was the scent of musk a large dark tree near him threw on the night air.. There had been a tree like it in the old wild garden some miles from Melbourne, shading a rustic seat. . Possibly it was the quiet, calm, star light night; or both of them together7; he did not know, but it was vain to escape the thought and memories which had taken possession of his brain. For some time he stood there rubbing a band slowly and me chanically. along his horse's neck, but, the animal moved away presently, and then he walked slowly down to tho bank of the creek. How long he stood there he did not know ; lie -went over the whole matter again in ' his ibind, giving; many memories,' long sternly repressed, a : hearing. and quoting to himself scraps arid sentences from old letters.. At lost the' horse's soft nose against his shoulder recalled liiui to himself, and with a little la'ugh which was half 11 sigh be retired; 

 to his tent. ..., i 

 ;V'r Days followed one, another, work" pro 

 gressed,'and everyone enjoyed the cool even ings succeeding the heat: of noon, and as the survey party sat on the bunks of the creek,* < talking or singing and disenssing the affairs 

 of the day, it was decided that a surveyor's life, th&ugh not all roses,1 yet held many pleasures and inducements that a city, bred 

 : " man could'never wot of. 

 And then one Sunday, afternoon Pollock started off by himself for a walk.--- He fol 

 lowed- the creek for some little way;, and.) then Btruck in across country to a fern gully. ' It was very bright and warm, the sun found all the brightest tints in the native grass and " in the few late wild flowers. There was a 

 faint breeze stirring in the trees overhead. And as he descended the hill which led to v - the cool fern shaded gully, it bore towards V :;; him mingled odors of wild shrubs and flowers. !? '-.' Wire grass wreathed- itself' over great 

 fallen logs, and about bracken and sword : ; grassl The descent was very steep, and pre 

 . seiuly the straight mottled hazel forming a , fringe, gave .place to splendid tree ferns, ; ' their trunks wreathed with hart's tongue and , delicate moss. He made his way along for 

 - some distance, and then, passing round the Ji, bole of an enormous white gum whose crown. ~ of leaves was some 150 feet from the ground, : .-. ' he came to a tiny creek,oferii'shaded,'-grass 

 . bauked ; with one late wattle sho'wing great 

 clusters of golden . bloom,. and under it, her face turned from him,.a .young girl. : He recognised her in an instant, however ; 

 every line and curve of her figure was indel . '? ibly impressed on his memory, the set of- her 

 head, the very attitude, all were-completely familiar; but his. heart was beating like ti " ? sledge hammer, the meeting was so totally 

 unexpected, and, he knew to his cost, so en - tirely welcome. A brunch under his foot : w snappod, and the girl turned towards him. 

 . 'He saw the colour lush, to .her face, a sudden. - light appear in her eyes, and her hands, lying j'.- in her lap, tightened on each other. For 

 ' fully a minute they gazed at one another ' without speaking, and then' the girl..rose to 

 her feet and came slowly towards him. 

 .' � How do you do?' she said gravely, and 

 held out her hand. 

 He returned her greeting, and looked .' curiously into her face, attempting to gather 

 ' something of her feelings and the mood she 

 ? was in. ? 

 'Are you glad to see me?' she asked, 

 abruptly. _ 

 4 Yes,' lie.said simply: ' You know I am.' ? He looked atUier blue eyes, her bright hairy 

 and then her lips parted itt- a friendly' smile,1 * ':v �nd a dpar little dimple grew in her chin. ; 

 Overhead, in the long. graceful fronds of. ?-tho tree ferns, tiny birds ''skimmed to and A v fro, and a woodpecker made a faint tapping' 

 with-his beak'.in a distant tree. .'The sun's rays penetrated here and there,-touching the water in 'the little creek and turning the -' shining specks of mica in its sandy bottom 

 'to glittering gold. 

 ^ The girl was/slight, bnt tall, her face was 

 ovul and rather pale, but her. darkieyes and 

 eyi-.'nsbea made a charming contrast to her. 

 iuir hair. ' 

 � Because I was learning to forget yon. ^ Shedrew herself up rather haughtily, an 

 her eyelids drooped over her eyea. Ap y that 1 should have interfered , wth yonr peace of mind.* Then she laughed. It Was impossible for her to pretend to be dignified 

 and angry,.' . >? -.: . . nr# ' �Don't look so severe,.she id. _ w e haven't seen one another for more than a year, and now yon are going to spoilt^ nice little meeting. : Where have you come 

 from f v , ? - 

 Pollock explained briefly. ? , . ;.l �I live here,' she returned. 'This gu''y � on our land - I get so lohely, I.am glad to meet you. Won't you sit down P And as she signified an old mossy long as a seat she might" have^been in a drawing-room, so 

 cracious was her manner. 

 " Pollock smiled. ' Do you mean that you live in the gully 1' he asked. 

 She pouted. - Of course, you are going to begin finding fault with the , way, I put my sentences together; you always used to. Our house is about a mile away A^b.g wooden building, wirh a verandah r0>,nI* and pines up the drive. You must have 

 seen it if you have been surveying near - 

 here.' - :. 

 A bright eyed lizard crept, out of a log and survevfd them curiously; opposite, a small l�ranchv-.. caught firmly in the sand, bobbed slowly u|.�nd down m the current of the creek ; a hanging strip of hark on the trunk of the big white gutu rattled in the breeze;. and in the distance there was. the loud, derisive cachinnation of laughing jaeK aSFor some half an hour- the young people sat together, talking earnestly. There was so much to bo said, so. much to be explained, 

 they Bcarcely noticed the beauty of tll� | scene about them,, the shifting lights and ^ J shadows, the syeet scents, but it affected them for all that, and when presently the 

 �irl rose, she said softly. 

 ".lam glad I met you here Frank, very �lad, but we musn't see each other again; for a time at least,' she added, as he began to protest. ' But you'll believe in me this 

 time, dear, won't yon?' "" 

 He bent his head gravely. ^ Forgive me for having doubted yon, darling. . 

 Her eves were very bright, a smile grew on her Hps to hide their quivering. She was very generous. " How could yon help it when you got in answer to that letter of vours my horrid little note, but I had to write it; though I tried my best to le_t yon see between the lines, as it were, that I was made wiite it.' . . , .. 

 ' And I was too blind, I only saw the bate words, and imagined you a heartless little sirl and every since have striven to forget you ; but,' looking at her with earnest eyes, < it was quite impossible.' : t 

 "Inn* glad* it was," she said simply� tor I had not forgotten you, but I must not meet ion again dear, nor write to you 

 lips quivered in real earnest this time, and Pollock would have taken her in : his arms, hut slie moved away. "No, she Bind , "no" ; then trars streamed down her cheek. ii 1 try not to be miserable at home, but it is ro hard. I have no companions, no one to i speak to scarcely but old Miss Bates; you 

 remember Miss Bates V A smile. gleamed through the tears " But I primal father. I'd; neither write to you nor hold any communication with you ; I havebroken_my promise, and will tell him a,bout it to-night. 

 There was more pluck in her. truth fill neBS than even Pollock could give her credit for; Being a man, he could not realise how com pletely she - was in awe of and feared^ her father, nor how the confession would be undertaken in fear and trembling, her ner-, vons foot lingering outside the study door, her unsteady fingers touching, the door knob at least a dozen times before daring to turn it He drew closer to her, belonged to take hor in his arms, hut she shook her head. " No Frank." She held out _ her hand, and as hft took it and covered it with both his, he looked down eagerly into her face. 

 "Good-bye," she said ; but he made no response, only tightened his grasp, and she heard his breath coming quickly. I must go, say gooH-bye to me, Frank. .. 

 " Good-bye, darling !" His voice was husky. " It is crnel to have met you like this, <ind to have to part, not knowing when we'll see each other again, but I have your promise, and I'll winyoii." . . . \\ ' She smiled up at him, and then lie bent and kissed her lightly on the forehead. She flushed, and then drawing her hand away said : " I'll wait for you, dear." , , 

 The setting sun sent h few bright rays-be tween the boles of the trees, and touched the oirl's fair hair, turning it to gold. She moved nwav :-a few steps, ntill looking Jiack, and then iiid smiling, " Good-bye ; when we meet again things will " be changed ; good bye dear." And as she mounted the hill, he stood watching her till the last gleam of her white drass had disappeared, and turiiing he found the gully all in shadow, and no bright 

 ness left anywhere.
