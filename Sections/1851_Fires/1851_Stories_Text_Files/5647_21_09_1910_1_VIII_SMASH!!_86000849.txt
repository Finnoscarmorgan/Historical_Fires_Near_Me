 A Tale of   THE GERMAN INVASION of 1912. 

 CHAPTER VIII. SMASH! ! 

 In a way, it was what the world had   been looking for�in some cases longing     for� this signal clash of two mighty mod-   ern navies. True, the modern war-ship, fighting "with miles of water between,"   was at the beginning of the century seen off the coast of Korea, when Japan en- gaged the navy of Russia, and made a sudden end of it; but all the world recog-   nised that it was an exceedingly one-sided contest. Up-to-date ships met the effete, rotten ships of a navy whose generalship, 

 or "admiralship," was equally rotten.   With the inevitable result.   But here were conditions of opposing   forces vitally different. In each were to   be found the very acme of perfection in   great fighting machines of the mighty   deep. On the one hand the navy of Britannia, whose fleets for a hundred     years had been the acknowledged mas-   ters of the seas; on the other hand, the   new-born fleet of the foremost Empire of Europe, whose mission it was to wrest the proud distinction so long held by Britannia. Alas! The cruel madness of it! The   fury and the blast of it! By 2 o'clock on that eventful Friday, the roar of mighty cannon almost shook   the shores afar off; the flare of fire, the   columns of dense smoke, created a scene   and circumstance akin only to pande- monium upon the waters of the North Sea. The gist of the cables on Friday night m'ay be thus summed up: The cannon- ading began, and was sustained for two hours, by only the larger first-class battle- ships of the line, as, under easy steam, they relatively proceeded north and south. It was practically a trial of long shooting between the rival-navies. Brit- ish marksmanship sustained its laurels. At the great distance of 15 to 17 miles effective shots were placed on several of   the German ships, which showed a ten- dency to converge on an outward line as they steamed south.   It is believed that in this initial en- counter only six or seven shots from the enemy's guns had got home on the entire   procession of the British Fleet, and in no case had it been disastrous, and no ship was disabled. In the return journey, Admiral Wilson was the first to wheel to the right, his command doing likewise, and maintain- inf same order as in the original onset, but with a course set south, which must bring the contending fleet into much nearer action if the German ships follow- ed in line in retracing their course. This was practically the case, with the excep- tion of the German Flagship, under com- mand, it transpires, of Commander-in-   Chief of the German Navy, Admiral von Holzendorff. Instead of maintaining a     mid-position in the heart of his fleet, he stood till his rear ships passed, signalling   orders to each, and, in this position, head on to the re-passing British line, awaited the return of the British Admiral's Superb. And these were among the Ger-   man ships which did heroic duty on that 

 day of fiercest battle that ever the British bull-dog waged upon the sea:�   Dreadnoughts � Nassau, Wisphalen, Rheinland, Posen (cruiser), Blucher (14,750 tons), Schliesen (13,200 tons), Wettin (11,830 tons), Hanover (13,200 tons), Zaringen (11,830 tons), Dresden (cruiser), Mecklenburg (11,830 tons), Konigsburg (cruiser), Witlessbach, Gnei- senau (11,800 tons), and Mainz. These 16 ships were evidently in the   first line of battle, and came more imme-   diately within the cognizance of the Brit- ish line, for only of these ships did the   cables make particular mention when the first actual smash was reported.   Mecklenburg, blown up. Nassau, sunk.   Blucher, put out of action. Hanover, captured. Posen, disabled.     Dresden, removed out of action, on fire. Gneisenau, captured. Thus were seven vessels of the German line accounted for; but what of the Brit- ish casualties?     Briefly, the conclusion of that day's messages ran:�     The British have lost three ships and two disabled; others more or less dam-     aged. The Blenheim sunk (with loss of 600); Drake, captured (the only capture);     cruiser Berwick, blown up (loss of 500);   armored cruisers, Black Prince and Done- gal, disabled.   It appeared, from Saturday morning's cables, that this meeting of the Admirals' was really the beginning of the intense part of the battle; it was then that ship laid into ship; nearer and nearer they drew together, to the end that one or oth- er might be destroyed. It was recorded that the handling of the Superb at this eventful hour by the Lord High Admiral was a magnificent display on a magnificent occasion. His ship, with one exception, represented the most modern and powerful battleship in the British Navy�an improved Dread-     nought of 18,600 tons, 21 knots speed. Her armor-belt runs from end to end of the water-line, made of the finest Krupp steel, hardened by special process; 11 inches thick over the central body, six inches thick at the bows, 4 inches at the stern, (11in. K. steel is equal in resist- ing power to 30in. thickness of wrought iron). The Superb carried 10 12-inch 58- ton guns, with an anti-torpedo armament of 16 4-inch 25-pounders, mounted on the turrets and at various points on deck, said to be much superior to 27 12-pound- ers on other Dreadnoughts. She also car-   ried ten searchlights for torpedo service and defence. Observing the action of the German Admiral, in pulling out of the line of the German ships, as if to give him battle, Admiral Wilson accepted the challenge, and thus it was that the Superb and Kaiser Wilhelm met as giant to giant in an almost personal encounter. Head to head they approached to with- in seven miles, belching forth their shots from the front turrets and foremost side guns. As if by common consent, these ships were practically left detached, the main lines, on either side, keeping up the   general outline of battle as described. 

 To Rear-Admiral Sir Colin Keppel seems to have been deputed, as second in command, the general order of battle. When within six miles the Superb and Kaiser Wilhelm, under easy steam, took parallel courses, and belched forth their broadsides. After an hour's fearful can- nonading at this comparatively easy dis- tance, midst the clouds of smoke it was made out that the after funnel of the Kaiser's Flagship had been swept away, and the smoke scattered widely from the after-deck, while two big holes were plainly discernible on the port bow by the officers' quarters; also, it was believed   the great ship showed a distinct list to port; but every gun seemed to remain intact, and its roar of fire undiminished. On the Superb the damage, so far, was not serious. Two close shaves of disaster had been missed. A heavy shot had struck the foremast just below the look- out and search-light platform, almost se- vering it, but it was held in position by the hollow-steel tripod; because of this it   looked as though the central fire control station might collapse at any moment, and Commander Roper (who had charge of the ship) had to make other arrange- ments for the central control. The other narrow escape from serious damage was from torpedo attacks; two had exploded within a few feet of the stern of the ves- sel, and others had been intercepted which had been aimed with deadly pre- cision. It was as the sun sank in a west- ern sky among a mountain of clouds, and the rain and wind ceased, that Admiral Wilson ordered a course direct on to the Kaiser Wilhelm. Here the cable news broke away from this most exciting naval duel, to epito- mise the general trend of the battle. "Hell let loose, and all the dogs of war a-barking," seemed the tragic note of that evening of fire and fury, when well nigh 200 battleships thundered and roar- ed, and swarms of smaller death-dealing engines of war fumed and smoked in the tornado of man-made thunder. After fighting in line for some time, a period of wild disorder seems to have been brought about towards evening, when, for the most part, ship met ship in compara- tively close contact, while others sailed round about each other. "Beresford on the Bellerophin" provid- ed one of the notable features of the great fight. He had been re-called from retirement, and from the floor of the House to the deck of this great warship, one of the finest of the Dreadnoughts. And finely he upheld the traditions of the British bull-dog. It was a splendid finish to a career and a character that had but one temporary eclipse. The Bellorophin had been set upon by two of the enemy's ships, one a medium cruiser and the other of not much inferior calibre to Lord Beresford's boat. The contest was thus unequal; and after three to four hours'   furious fighting the Bellorophin�a name     far-famed in England's naval annals�be-     came a badly used boat. Caught between two fires she fought right and left, pour- ing out a torrent of shot and shell; so, as   the evening shadows fell, she had not a flag left to fly; her masts were blown away; only one funnel remained; her     decks were strown with dead and dying and slippery with blood; more than a third of her 900 fighting men were killed, and two-thirds of her guns were silenced. Seeing that this was the case, the com- mander of the larger vessel, which, it transpired, bore the flag and the presence of the second in command of the German Fleet, Prince Henry (brother of the Kaiser), signalled instructions to the com- mander of the other vessel which had played upon the Bellerophin to leave the conclusion of the matter to him, so sure 

 was he that he had the prize at his mercy. But the sequence proved he counted with- out his host�sans Beresford and the     British bull-dogs of the still unconquered Bellerophin. . . . From the cockpit came the word�"Not more than 40 big     canon shot left in the lockers!" "Enough     and to spare!" cried the "never-say-die" commander. "At least our engines are left to us! Put her straight on to the enemy, and fire only from the foremost 12-inch"�one of the pair had been put   out of action. The distance of the vessels when this order was given was not more than three miles, and as the Bellerophin bore down upon the 13,000 ton Schleisen, broadsides were poured out upon her, but straight on she steamed; on as if courting   certain death, for her fire was as the last dying spurting of a monster whose strength was spent. . . What would Beresford do? If he went down, he would not go alone! If his ship and guns were disabled, he and his men that were left alive were yet full of fight; and he would put Prince Henry and his men to the su- preme test. The Prince stood his ground. He must have perceived the daring at- tempt, and been amazed; but he did not   run. One thing he did not know that Beresford purposed doing�if the possibil-     ity offered. On came the externally broken and disfigured Bellerophin. Flash lights from the Schleisen flamed over the path of the British vessel as darkness fell; a mile�a half-mile�of choppy sea           alone divided them; the 12-pounder steadily replied still to the belching of the German guns, and the water about the Bellerophin showed like a molten inferno, ploughed up and splashed by tor- pedo explosions and shot and shell. Still on came the Bellerophin, till the yells of the rival crows were heard midst the yell of the big guns. . . . Ah, then! The   daring of it! Full-speed ahead! . . . It was the psychological moment�the su- preme dash and nerve, that did it; with the nicest calculation and finest seaman- ship and cunning, under cover of the darkness, 'tween the intermittent flashes, the Bellorophin had rammed the Schlei- sen�rammed her amidships�and with         such impact that the two vessels for quite the space of 15 minutes hung to-gether. . . . Fifteen fatal minutes for the Schleisen! For the sequel was thus written:�"In     twenty minutes after the crash, the flag of Rear-Admiral Prince Henry of Prussia was razed, and the proud Schleisen was a captive to the prodigious valor of a Brit- ish commander who had made the desper- ate onslaught, when every indication was that he was beaten out of all hope of re- covery!"   The cry of "a Beresford�a Beresford!"     rang through the lines, and to London, ere the broken Bellorophin could tow her prize to port. But what of the fight all along the line? It was not until Sunday morning that decisive news came to hand. The posters were headed in massive type, "Victory, Victory, for the British Navy!"   It was a glorious victory, truly, but hard- ly won. Not absolutely decisive, for a slight majority of vessels of the enemy had escaped, and bore away with them 13 of the British ships; but they had cleared   with these while yet the British were un- certain of victory; they had run away, perchance, for fear they might lose all. Sooner than expected they must have re- alised defeat was facing them. Far into the night the struggle raged; but about mid-night the British ships ranged to- gether and awaited the dawn of the next morning. Then it was found that no less than 43 of the 79 British vessels had dis- appeared. Those comprised five of the great Dreadnoughts; seven armored crui- 

 sers out of 20; 13 out of 33 torpedo boats   and half of the submarines (7) had sunk never to rise again.   Surely it was victory at a terrible cost?   But these figures included the prizes, of which, in big and little, it was reported there were supposed to be 19. The German losses were believed to be a total of 46. Six out of 14 Dreadnoughts, eight out of 18 cruisers, 20 out of 40 tor- pedo boats, 12 of the 22 submarines (which were responsible for many of the greatest fatalities of the battle). As   against 11 ships taken as prizes by the enemy, the British had secured 15. And of the slain? The more statement of the killed and wounded told of the desperate severity of the North Sea fight. No less than 4100 British seamen and officers failed to be ac- counted for when the rolls were called. Whole ships and their crews had simply disappeared. But, because of the cap- tures effected by the Germans, the total slain could not then be stated. The Germans were reported to have to talled between 5000 and 6000 men. So much for the immediate results of the great North Sea fight. What of the hostilities which were rag- ing down the Channel, and nearer the heart of the Empire? What followed "Black Thursday?" What of the host from Emden?   Have patience, reader, for yet a little breathing space.
