 CHAPTER I. 

 BULDK TBDHSDtT. 

 It van on the tnoining ol that memorable ay whioh holds euob a conspicuous portion in lbeannate of Viotorian history-"Black Thursday "-that a yonngborseman emerged bom the Plenty ranges, shaping his course towards the lower, and settled portion of the upper Plenty. The heat even at that early hour beoame almost intolerable. The blazing sun whioh was partly enveloped in the clouds of smoke issuing from the bush Area, oast a terrible hue of purple over the eoorohed and dreary landscape. Not ft living thing could be seen or heard; even the noisy parraket held its shrill and discordant chirrup, and the kangaroo took refuge in the Bbady scrub, to dozo away the awful oppression n^iich weighed on the face of nature. 

 The young buiihman whom we are about ' to introduce to the reader, and who, ap 

 parently, had weathered many a soorohing ray-judging by the tBDDsd oolor of bis skin 

 manifested some unrasiness atthe unusual appearance of the heavens; for he constantly cast a searching glance at the burning sun, and also at the fires raging behind, which drove him out into the open country. His age might bo about seventeen; hie com plexion was drali, probably by exposure to an Austrulinn sun; for that portion of his skin which hail been oovered, or shaded, ap utared'whilc and ddi'ite asit Jcmftlfl's. His naifi_fr';l>iowe, and thr slight Mard which j hie upper lip, wrru black. His eyes ' -which were plifrbtly eliaded-were dark, 

 and most expressive. His mouth was well Bhaped, with thin lips, showing great firm ness for his years; he had a straight, bnt short nose, and a nicoly-rounded ohin. 

 His figure appeared rather Blight round the watte; bnt the shoulders were remarkably broad tor his age, with long arms; in short, all his limbs were well knit, and his whole person set forth a perfeot type of Australian rough-rider and thorough bushman, for it ap peared manifest to an experienced eye that he was perfectly " at home " in his saddle. He rode one of those wiry and hardy hones Which his district -Maneroo-has been bo lamsilor produoing-horses which were un .qualed {or enduranae and courage. 

 Tha young bushman was clothed in cord, Strapped pants; a red Crimoan shirt; Na poleon, or riding. boots; a tweed jaoket ?trapped before him on tho saddle, with a cabbage-tree hat on hie well-formed head. A large stook-whip hong in coils from the tide of his saddle, while ho rode slowly along with that ambling pace peculiar to stookmcn while in search of cattle; but even at that alow paoe, the young rider seemed anxious and puzzled at the quantity of perspiration which poured from the flanks of the hardy steed, He occasionally laid his palm on each ride to ascertain the cause, and also drew the drooping ears through his fingers another feature which gave him uneasiness 'concerning hiB trusty nag, lest it should '" knock up " before he gained his destina tion ; bnt 110 was too good a judge to believe that his morning's ride could oaase such langonr and exhaustion in the animal. 

 The intense oppression and the alarming state ol the weather beoame every moment mora apparent. The hot winds blew in ter nflo gusts, sweeping away in whirling cloudB dried leaves and dust, while the ean beoame overcast with mountains of -impenetrable smoke from the numerous buBh-fires whioh 

 oontinnally sprang up in fresh parts, pro ducing a gloom whioh threatened to extin 

 the light of day. 

 The horse, which had beforo manifested such (atigue, gave a sudden bound that al most unseated its experienced rider, who, on balancing and steadying himself again in the sa&uls, turned his head round to asoer tain the oafcee of the unaccountable freak of his nag. Hd saw to his horror the flames of the bush-fires speeding after him at a fearful rate, and the burning leaves (ono of which alighted on the horse's hind-quartor) shower ing around him UUe fire-flakes. There was no necessity to ., - his horse onwards, for the animal im>ti> etivJ.v comprehended the peril which ! Iiri atened ihem, find flow away at a furious jjnie, bounding ana 'snbiti&i; at every fresh spark which HI on its hide. The dangerous situation in which the rider found himself piaocd brought forth all his judg ment and experience in averting tho raging dement; but to his consternation be behold, 

 fresh Area sponging up all around him through the flaming leaves and grasses whioh were borne away on the whirl-winds. The clonds of smoke and asheB in woich he was enveloped prevented him from seeing any distance ahead; but at last some indica tions of habitations being in the vioinity beoame evident, for he perceived some chil dren flying across his path in great terror towards a farm-house a distance to ono side. At this moment he beheld a little girl of about six years old, who had seemingly been left behind by her more speedy aud older companions, ronning round in the same spot, with her little hands covering her eyes, in order to shade them from tho smofco and ashes, while she cried pitifully after tho re treating fugitives. Seeing her perilous and ' forlorn situation, the young horseman 

 dhecked his flying steed with a sudden pull whioh almost brought it on its haunches; when he sprang upon the ground, caught tho child in his arms, vaulted into the saddle again, and rode off this time towards the farm; but, unfortunately, ho beheld to his disappointment, a strip of fire cutting him off, whioh compelled him to hold on his original sonrse in order to escape destruc 

 tion. 

 The child, who still held her eyes closed, instinctively iburied' her face in her pro teotor's bosom, while hor little arms wound round his waist. The young man at ?the tame time held her with one arm before 

 him on the saddle, while he guided and man aged the horse with tho other hand. They toil this way for a short distance, when the terrified ana exhausted animal plunged into a long pond or water hole whioh etrctohod across their course. The young rider with Ms burden quioldy extrioatcd himself from Aho saddle, and, after cwimming a few Strokes touched bottom, where he stood with the oold water up to his chest still holding the child in his arms. 

 She horse, also, in finding euch a eool ele ment, <*tood still with the water up to his back, whioh protected him from the heat and fiery spasks. . 

 The ohild, who was first to speak after tfadMtUdden immersion exolaimed: " Where ags wa Mr. Whitford, is it the water. 

 tig;, I am not Mr. Whitford my pet; open 

 < ymt eyes and see," replied the young man, 

 -encouragingly. 

 " 1 oan't fipen them; they ate full of salt," pleaded the ebild, pltiouely rubbing the bitter ashes from them. 

 - "Wait, my dear, I will batlio them for 

 you," added her nroservor, bathing her pretty faoe, and manifesting as muoh skill in 

 ibat benevolent operation u a oures 

 81 Alter getting olear of the aeheswhioh. to 

 poSed her vision, tbe child openod ber largo blue eyes and stared wonderingly in the 

 younn man's �aoe, which was OIOBO to her OTO; whon her pretty lips began to tremble and puree up, ominous eigm-as he under fltoop-ol woeping, when he enoouraged her 

 iu the following words: 

 i " Don't ory, ohild; you know I saved yo 

 troin the fire, whioh would bum you to death if I had not come the way.' . 

 . � Oh so TOO did. X remember now 1 the

 cramped limbs nould not hold her up, so that elie was obliged to Bit down while her pre 

 eerver led out ot tbe water the sagacious 

 animal whioh brought them to this fto j>� 

 ealetv. Mounting a gam. with the ohila in 

 his ibp the horseman steered his way cautiously through the burntgroandt�wards the place where ho knew the farm honso stood, in order to deliver his young oharge Bitely He had, bowevor, to piek his traok, and evade many smouldering objects whioh imperilled the hoofs of his nag, lest the poor 

 animal should .uflor more S�jory faom 

 the fires whioh bad nearly proved fatal to them that morning. , , 

 On riding along little Nina gamea more courage, and chatted away at a great rate, informing her deliverer that she was her mamma's only child,and that they were both staving at Mr. Whitlord's house. That Mr. 

 Ca&er had a fatm on the other Bide of the 

 oreek and that Mr. Oalder's boys took her away that morning along with them 'o look for the oowa, and, on "eeinR the bush-fire coming, tbey ran away and left her. 

 On leaebioR tho farm, a frightful epeotaole presented itself to the young man. Tha oom iortable and enug establishment which, an hour before, etood betore bun, had now a most deplorable and desolate aspeot,.Not. vestige of house, stacks, bBrn, or 'eneo was to be seen, and tho only traces.of the enug duelling whioh remained were the two

 lost in thought, looking abstractedly at the beautiful but frail image before him. The vital spark had almost deserted its frail tene ment through the terrible experiences of that morning. The pale and hollow chocks, the moistened brow, and the deep, sunken but brilliant eyes, were ead proofs of near 

 dissolution. 

 It was now suggested that a person t-hnuld start off at once for the nearest medical wan, which, on hearing, the stranger pmp.inoil (as he himself was on his way to MclbuutnG) that he should aooompliuh that ohj',-ct, which kind set every one present thanked him for. On taking leave, little Nina ran townrdH him holding up her pretty face to rcceivcluK pit t ing kiss; when, with a sudden burst of un controllable affection be rained her in bis arms and embraoed her fondly, while she wound her little arms round bis neok, whispering in 

 his ear: 

 " Will you pray for poor mamma?" 

 " 1 will, my dear. God protcct you my poor ohild 1 I may see you again."
