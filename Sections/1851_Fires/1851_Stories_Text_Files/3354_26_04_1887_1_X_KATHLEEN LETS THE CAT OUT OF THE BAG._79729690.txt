CHAPTER X. 

 KATHLEEN LETS THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG.' 

 Oar hero's epistolary account of hia ad ventures in the capital of Victoria may seem ridloulons to some of our more experienced readers, nevertheless it will show the sim plicity and harmless oharacter of those in habiting and passing a life of quietness and unobtrusivencss among the more sequestered parts ofonr eztonBive continent. The con tents of the Irller, though simple in them selves, were eagerly perused and appreciated by thoec whom the writer intended to amuse and please, save one, and that one was the 

 last he would wish to annoy. 

 Kathleen Haley, whom Lizzy visited im mediately on receipt of the letter (for tbej? were now too old to attend school) pcrusei? the welcome nown, but, to Lizzy's disappoint' 

 ment ami surprise, her fair neighbor mani fested no pleasure, nor did she share in the general delight which tho other members of both families expressed at the advent oi the epistle or -the exported arrival of the 

 writer. 

 Lizzy, did not stay long on peroeiving the dejected looks of Kathleen, and returned home forwith but as soon as the sound of her horsa's steps died away on tho breeze, Kathleen rushed to her room,whore she gave vent to her sobs and a flood of tears. Her bind mother, peroeiving the movement and bearing her daughter's weeping, became both surprised and alarmed, and flew to hert exclaiming: 

 " Kathleen,tnavourneen, what in the name Of goodnoss ails you ?" 

 "Ob, mother dear, I oannot bide it any longer I It is about Arthur." 

 " Artbnr, my honey I what ot him? Isn't be right well ? Didn t you sse by his letteri child, that be bought �U the things and Is eoming soon ?" 

 " I don't sare for tho things, mother. It's 

 himself." 

 " My gracious, child I what do jou mean ? Keep quiet a moment. There now-dry you^^^rsand lean on my shoulder. Woj^^^^Mbt^roor own dutliog mother 

 "Oil, mother dear, you won t be angry with me?" 

 "Angry at you, mavourneen? Why should ! I be angry at you child, that never did any 

 I harm in your life?" 

 [ "Is it harm to love another more than ! you and my lather, and not telling it (or BIX 

 years?" 

 | " My poor innoocnt obild, is that the cause j ot your griet ? I understand now, my honey, j You love Arthur then ? The thing i.ever 

 Btruok me to thia moment. Don't fret your 

 self any more. That's but a fault which every boy and girl commits in their time, and which your poor mother oom : mittod before you." 

 " And you forgive me, mother dear?" 

 j "Forgive you, honey? There's nothing 

 to forgive. Don't you know it's natural for boys and girls to love one another, other ! wise there would be no marriages? And 

 you say that you have loved Arthur lor six years? Do you think he loves you in re 

 turn?" 

 Ho told me so once, but you see by hit letter that he loves that little girl in Mel bourne, whom be calls Nina, and whom ha 1 uaved on Black Thursday when sbe was a 

 child, if you remember." - 

 " lloo 1 milt murder, the oat Is out of the bag at last 1 Why, you little goose, she is only a child still. The boy is only treating 1 her as a plaything. You "need not be in the 

 least alarmed, my child. That littlo girl, you hear, is hardly thirteen yet." 

 " I was only thirteen myself, when I first came to know that I loved him, and when ho-" 

 " When-he what, my honey? What did be 

 do?" 

 "He kisBed me I Was there harm in it ?" whispered Kathleen, in great eon(ueion,mixed 

 with fear. 

 ! >. God bless the innooent ohild I many . 

 kiss the boys stole from me before I was married to your father, and thought nothing . of it a moment alter. It was the fashion in 

 onr plaoe." 

 "Dear me I Do yon say ao mother I I never was kisssd but tnat time, and then Arthur did not do it intentionally, he was only acting what ho saw in the theatre in Melbourne. But is it not strange that I should never forgot it, and from that same moment I loved him?" 

 "Now tell me this, mavourneen: when did he say that he loved you, or how did it 

 oome about ?" 

 " Oh it was one day we were out hunting kangaroos with Lizzy and Austsy, who could not keep up with Arthur and me. I think Arthur vh teasing me about Anstey, and angry chat I did not go out with him at usual to ride. We then made an agreement to answer all the questions which the otbei put. and when I asked him Whether he was in love, and the description of his sweetheart which exactly corresponded with my own image, and at last I asked her name,when he gave my own." _ ,, 

 " Well, that was a funny way too. Troth, ; lint's not the way the; courted me in ' Ireland. They would tell me plump and 

 plain that they were dying for me, and praise my beauty up to the skies. Bat I suppose they do it differently in Australia. Did.he say anything about marriage to you after 

 that?" 

 " Never, we ate both too (by .to mention j anything that way." 

 I .. Well, my love, I don't know whai : txactly to say. That Jack Tantrum Is 

 marriage to him, and although we know he ! is very rioh and clever and all these things; ! i<till, we dont like him for a husband for : you, my dear. If we thought that Arthur I meant to ask you some time, he would bs fat I more preferable. Still, he may not think of i marriage at all, end it would be a pity to 

 lose a good offer like Jaek." 

 "Oh, mother, I would never oonsent to marry Taok Tantrum-I bate him. But it I see Arthur is in love with that little Nina, and if he meanB to take her hure to teach us rnusio, as be proposes, sooner than see her I hie wife, I would oeoopt Tantrum." 

 | " I don't believe Arthur loves the girl in ' that way; however, we'll wait and see. j You are young onough yet to speak of these : things." 

 Our hero little suspected the mischief bis unconscious praiee of Nina had oreatei in j the pure heart of bis adorable Kathleen, 

 whom he intended to benetit by Nina's in , /itructiona in music, BB well as his own 

 sistets. ~~ -- 

 | On bis arrival at homo, be was rather dis ? appointed at Kathleen's oool reception of i him, although all the others Beemed to hail ! his return with more joy than formerly, : owing to the his long absence. And even when the many gilts and costly female gar ments arived by the dray from Twofold Bay, with the piano included, her distance and apparent indifference to his oompany re ceived no change. He oould not oomprehend the reason,although he oontinnally taxed hit ' mind to disoover the oauBe, and, at length : came to the conclusion that either Anstey or , Jack Tantrum must be at the bottom of it, I for he knew no other likely rival who oould ! '>out him out.",, 

 I Tii'! piano ami musio were put into re ' quisition id due time, when the young ladies, 

 under the tuition of AnBtey-who was an ex j cclleut player-and Mrs. IiBndon-who soon 

 revived het prolicieney in that accomplish ment-soon beoimo passable players, while the younger members of both families prac tised regularly also. 

 The time passed thUB pleasantly along,until Arthur'ancxt trip to make with his atook drew nigh, when Kathleen became every day mors low-spirited and distant towards him. Brill, he could not imagine the oause of this singu lar estrangement. The day before hie de parture, \\jrben taking leave ot Haley's family, he obtained an opportunity to saw a tew words to her privately, when the following conversation took place: 

 " I am glad to have this opportunity to 

 talk to you aloce, Kathleen, before I leave. ; Tour late coolnoss towards me has been n cause of great anxiety and surprise to 

 me.." 

 " I suppose that yon don'l eare muob, now that you are to visit Melbourne and eee your friends there who are nioor and mora ac complished than we poor bush girls." 

 " I don't understand what you msan by my ' Melbourne friends,' Kathleen, for I have very few there. But I am sorry that I have lose your favor so muob lately. It I have dono anything that haB displeased you, it must havo been done unintentionally, and I would like that you should let me know of it." 

 Kathleen had a good share of spirit in her. Bhe would Booner suffer the most aoute pain and disappointment than let Arthur porcelveKhat she was jealous of the accom plished and favorite Nina-as she thought and sbe therefore replied and behaved with i moro indifference than her hoirt diotated. 

 Shoiilflo know by his words and looks that , *io entertained some suspicions that some i other rival had stepped in when he was away so long on the former trip. Not wishing to eonvinou him of the contrary, and as a set 

 off to bis own faithlessness, she said:- 1 . " l'oople change their minds at times, it 

 seems." i 

 Whatever else Bhe intended to say oould irit find utleianoc, 'or a choking sensation 

 P "Ob, ?( (hat U the oaee it 

 matter. But I didn't think that yod were - one of those people, Kathleen," ana, without , waiting tor an answor, be epurrcd hlB horse-upon which he had 'been ii'it.n during the conversation - and rallop'd nway in a state ot mind not to be I'u vu-ii 

 Poor Eatbl'ien stood transfixed on the spat, | gasping for breath, ami staring after him I jntil be bad paused from her eight. 

 I Her oontoienoe smite her for the nnfor ' tunate expression whioh the had made, and i which had a contrary rfl�ct on her lover to I tbnt intended. On re-entering the houBe she 

 took refugo in her room, in older to evade I the looks ol tbo family, and give vent to her | struggling teste. The sharp and anxious 

 gaze ol her aflootioonle mother detected her grief. She soon followed ber to console as 

 j uEual, enquiring in pereu&tive and kind ao 

 I oenta. 

 "Wist has disturbed my darling Kath leen ? Another love quarrel, I gvppoeo. Open your heart, mavourneen, to your own 

 mother." 

 ".Oh, mother dear, he left rae in anger I It ia ail over now and for nver.'k exclaimed the disconsolate Kathleen, in great grief. 

 .. Have ooutRRe, my honey, loa may be mistaken. Whole fault was it, my 

 child?" 

 .. Oh, that ia the worst part of it I It was all my own, and I drove bim away under the impression that I had changed my 

 mind." 

 " Haw did yoa da that, Kathleen ? bet DM 

 hear it." 

 11 You see, (gather, X have been eooler to bim ainoe he oame baols from Melbourne last trip, throagh being annoyed abont that Nina be thinks eo much of. I understood by bis words to-day that he imagined I liked some other person better than himself, and, juat through a foolish spits, I did not undeceive him. And ao he has gone oS in a hnS, under that impression. I wonld give the world, if I had it, to recall my words now, bol it ia too late; he'U meet that girl again who is now grown ap and is ao accomplished,! (ap pose." 

 " Make yourself easy my ohild. If Provi dence sees it ia proper that yoa ehould be man and wife, He'll bring it roond in 

 time." 

 After tbeaepiotu and maternalconsolations, Kathleen became more teoonciled to her fate, and, by degrees, gained her equanimity. Not to her dejected lover. He bad no one to console him on his Journey to the distant market, or to cheer his disconsolate thoughts daring his long night watches while oamping with his etook. Many a weary boar lie pasaed in no better oompany than his own ead thoughts and regretful memory. Some times he would come to thff resolution to drive her from his memory altogether, and turn his thoughts to the sprightly Nina, who must be now grown np a little, and as old as Kathleen was when ha first beoame enamowd with her. These hopefal consolations were occasionally applied to hia disappointed mind as a balm to his woanded feelings; bat, alas, they were soon dispelled, as will be seen in 

 the next dhtpter.
