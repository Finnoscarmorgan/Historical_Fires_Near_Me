 � . CHAPTER . T. . 

 THEY were seven .men �'all'tojd," ttito�geyen including twc\\ raw lads, .who, ]� nstrali�n^l�lce," . though not Australians, claimed" ali the 

 privileges of a more advanced manhood, end who, as most probably likely to take um- 

 brage if classed as mere boys, are -here j thrown in at� venture. " I 

 -The lender or prime mover was a-dtily cer- tificated surveyor, Frank Pollock hy nu me,, of the petiod, proud in the possession of H fair salary and allowances, besides a com- plete field equipage of three tents, a dray and six good bullocks, provisions and utensils, together of course, with "tho tools - of the trade," the " circumferentor," the. chains and arrows, flags and flag-poles,-and some .big 

 broad axes. 

 The labor elemont was represented J>y two* stout Irish chainmen. ono: cook'(an English-, 

 man), one bullock driver (a Scot), and.otir. two probationer lads fresh from. school via 

 the PONS A9�NOBUM. ? ? .-/ .. .

 r j sThe dray with the instrumental parapher 

 ". nalia, the " vivres.", .the chains and flag ..' . poles, �EC, was propped up on the left of the 

 ' men's tent and of the entire encampment, . .while the bullocks. - to wit, " On ptain," 

 ; V Strawberry," " Jack," ".Ginger, " Tommy," i- and " Rodney," wandered about in clinking 

 hobbles and nt their, own. sweet wills.under 

 __the. gnarled and giant gums in the paddock. . . . "r- There in the beautiful past there was more : . of nature" and ' less of arti in .-that sylvan 

 - demesne than yon will find to-day. - 

 The Yarra, then a clear potable stream, : .- -flowed- gently �nd lazily along beneath its 

 broad and heavy fringe of aromatic under wood and flowering plants, and thc-: dense . masses of golden bloom and swart, foatherly 

 -foliage that always distinguish the mimosas ; of the river batik. 

 / We had then no- nasty glue factories nor - wool wssheries, nor-; tanneries, nor candle 

 =works,, nor malodorous sewers to pollute the .ir aboriginal purity of the current. 

 v- ' - The platypus, a creature of eminently 

 cleanly, habits,, wits often to be seen-here, ';...- .. ttimbing about 'mid stream like a miniature 

 . ' "Beal ; and the kingfishers (generally hy pairs)

 boughs of some naked and ..withered gum, -t would fright the river ; nymphs from their ;- . �proprietary with all manner of weird and 

 chuckling cachinnations, but if the jackass * " �.'?? was mostlyron oy�donoo-i\\t-n>atinan.and.even? v.i-song, the clear sweet silvery.-chimes' of the ;/i . /bell bird were . constant even, through -1 the ?.j--, severest heat of tlierdny. ^ .'- ./. - 1
