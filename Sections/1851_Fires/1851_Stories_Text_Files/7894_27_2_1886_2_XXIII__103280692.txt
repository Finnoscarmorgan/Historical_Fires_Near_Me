" A vntELt.so of relief and thliantfulness pervaded the' heart: of Augustus SGklton when the young girl opened her eyes. lIe Lhad now, in his own ides atoned in measure for his cowardly'atta'k upon' Ellen, and her subs quent death beneath tals its of B erchyoombo, then so far from him over tho'ewa. li knelt down beside the girl, andwa delightod to per. ccive that, although her face wias disfigured by the smoke,. and her clothing was, singed in places, he was vitally and outwardly, uninjured. In a few moments aho essayed to rise and sald, "Mv mother! Oh, have you saved her L" "In there! -is sha in the hut?" cried .Augustua, starting to his feet. The girl mado a sign of assent,' and he lost no time in retracinyhis.ateps to the smouldoring log.hut, but for: somo minutes he was unable to obtain an cntulcio. As he was "truggngog with the dense volumes of smolo the agent eraived, and, without a moment's hesitation, dashed into the hut. Then Augustusagain took courage, and, kee?p. ine' his mouth and nostrils covered, :followed his bold leader. They found the body. of a woman lyinoi full length; face downward, on. the floor. Neiiber of the men spoke, or eoven m dan?ign. By a simultaneous movement they raised her up, and bore her vwith muchb difficulty from the: hot. She "was?:livre,tholugh dreadfully scorched, and quite Uno recognteable then. "I will ride down and send auisanore',' said the brave agent. "? You will want it. I do not think the flre will hurt you hero. You can remain till help comes. Farewell." IAll Augustus's good fceling and manhood now ap. pealed to, he set to work'to do al ho 'could for the ,poor women who had .been rescued. Ito provided for them couches, in a roughl.and.roady fashion it is tree;, brought them water in his wide-brLuimed hlt, and exerted himself in every polssiblu way for their comfort. The little food he still carried lit set before them.:. flo lighted a fire upon'tho alrcidy scorched earth, and made them somo lioor tea. By degrees they recovered strength, and before nightfall, for no iiassttance had arrived, both the ladics were able to thank him for his humanity, bravery, and kind attentions. "I fear,'sir, we have no means, beyond our most grateful t~anks, to reward you as you deserve. Your f riend ralso "o fancy, will: soon return. Will he notP '` Th i was the eldor woman's question. "Itrust to," replied Augustus. "I expected him Sbefore this. It is a terrible scone. I hope he is safe."' ' 'Just then a loud conto" attracted his attention. "it fs a signal," said tho woman; "help is at hand.- 'Thnnk Heaven we are saved!" Skelton called out as loudly as he could in reply to thoe'.repeatid cooces, -and a party of horncmen approached. They had come out in search, but had seon nothing of AMr. Crawford. "lHo left here some hours ago," said Skelton. " Can anything have happened to him ? " ':" It's runsaoibloe.to'. say, the smoke's so thick "about.' Well have a seach when the moon rises. Come and help Iinke up litters for' the poor wometn. Who are they.F" "Farm, servantos,, I believe," replied Skelton. "They are not seriously injured ; but their fices are very much scorohed and blackened, poor creatures!" "Luckr it's no worse. Driscoll's dead, or as good :s dead, by the croek, and the whole of the Meount end its eople ire burned to cinders." " The' Mount' House!" exclaimed Augustus. "The Widow Skelton's house? " "0So I'm told," replied the man. "Poor thingsl Well, let's have a glance around." The search by moonlight was fruitless, and at last, tired and sleepy, the men threw thlemellves down upon the hot ground Ieside their horses. " Wi the earliest day-dttwn they were Sgain mounted, and Augustus, laving ,seen the iimspro'it.'d litters on the way to tthe ettlem et, cacn ii:d by sturdy bearers,took a hasty farewell of the poor w\\'tucn, and sccompanied the rscaching exeitin. lie0 was , r vously axioly anxious, ,nd ilspellkd to lave, life. 10e fancied that by eo doing he would quiet his con. science. Tho terrible ?pieode of his life had been curiously brought to ,i? is collhl.ionl by the Ipor girl ho had carried out of the hut. She in some indo finable manner rcunnisLd him of Ellen-whethser the voice, or th ecxpr,e?'son of terror, or the face had thus moved hism, he couhli nt tell. Why could he not forget that terriile lay at ]lcechycomnbo ' Why ? liceause it was l:art of hits plnisshmsnit to reme.mber! hMemory and Co?nsciencesllce the true avengs-n of our evil deeds! Death had strangely dogged hisl footsteps From the time of his app aianrc at Itcrlchycorm?br the grim tyrant had L?esn at Sl:eltlon's :lbow. Was ho iecursed i It would rctn vo.

We were young then, but the statement made a dsleep iunlrecion upo(,n ts. She wa's a kiend woman, and her naie was hose. She remairned in our family one yvear. MIy little reister died within that time. '.hl?e woman left, but in a few montlh was again i'nga;gcd, being an :exellehnt rervanit. Again Death drove her away, and what afterwards becarme of her we ido not reis?umlber tor have heard. So Skelton, in like minncer, felt, that the fatial hand wits held over himr. His life was cursed; the chilling ban of Naomi Blryce, uttered against his house, was still upon hims. Hlis father, the old lawyer; then srceet, innocent Ellen; und sNaomi her. self, had all been claimt by the dread messengr ;r and even in Australia the slarts frem the grim and bony hand were lau:nchled around him in the bus,h. Ilai relatives apparentlv lhd Iperishid, and now his kind conductor 'tewas Iusi;ing. Truly, Ellen was avenged! 

 At eve'ry lt p iho dinictltieS of the soarclhers were very great, and the effecta of the fire terrible. 1Numlcrs of cattle and will animannls, with an enor mouis quantity of birds, were found burned to cindere. The tracks of the horI.se' feet were with dilltculty followed upon the encumtr bered and, in ploces, ,molhing ground. Ilerondtlhrr hugo trees wcero burning etill, and the imolo was yet hanging tlhilly in the air; hbut the fire was burnt out. Over a space of nearly threo hundred miles from first to Sost the derastation extended. Thousands of sheop and cattle had pr-ilhed; houses, farms, bridgee, and produce, with whole families, had bcen dettroycd; +and " Black Thursday " will for ever remain a dark spot in tho annals of Victoria'.* Tlho troop canme at length to a ravinuo over which the flamos lind apparently leaped, or crossed by thll treer, awithoaut decending. Theo horso's trancl stopped there. The men halted and looked at each other. Slelton turned deadly Ianlo and sick. The Srevenge of Ellen was again on her "murderer." " leaven help lus!" exclaimed one mnn. " He must have lost his way in the moke;c, and fallon in hero, No' chance for him, poor rlchap!" " Might he not have been caught.in the bushes- they are still uncharred P Sco, I can got down. Let meno io." "You Why, man, you wouldn't get down that way. Come horc-thlro's a kind of track." They all desceonded, and found the horseo at the lottom of the doll-dead-dashed to pieces. All felt that hope for the poor ngent had received a dleath blow, when a fi'ait voice was heard from the thiclhot close by. They hurried up, and there lay the poor annn in a most exhausted and bruisod condition, but still alivo. Having oeen to the comfort of his now acqulain tanco, the unfortunato ngent, w.:o could not ba moved, , Auglstus detennined to put his originatl plansinto exe Scution and go up to the diggings, HIohed monoy at. call.

Weak as water, blo n hither and thithrr by every blast of euspicion om fear, Augustu was to be pitied indccd. His con ,cience tortured him unceasingly. ie would argtue that ho was innocent; but he was really guilty, bocaiso he had not had the manhood to att?rmpt to -avr the girl he had pretended to lose. This wan his chtaracter. lfo'could not stand alone. Witihe anyone else besido him heo could bo firm and obsti nato, but a stronger will moulded him for evil or for .;good. Ila passions and his fears often were tvo , uch for him. Ito was at their morcy, and ha suffered. � : : ]Io was, as hbe thought, fortunate enough to fall in: with an Englishman from his own county, who was also about to try his luck. This man -a rather _rough fellow--agreed to trael'up the country will him, and well armod thoy tiarte?. Tito bosh rangers had just then "left off work" on the road, .whorm they had 'not long :beforo, beea vcry antivc, and tihe adventurers were not molested.

E,?ocoor, and more than enougl, has bcoa writ' eon about the gold forever. The subject was well-nigh exhnuated long ago; and an)one who wants infor mation of a sensational charactcr respecting tihe diggings and the buh.-ranging need only turn to a fle of Sfydney trod other pipers, or E:nglitih periodicals of the period, to find the most romantic and dramalti incidents ready to hand. We will, therefore, only tfueth upoin the adventures at Ballhrat-that lawiess r etttlemenit-and thr a vube quent incidents, as they inumediate'y coce?trned the chief persolugo-we can scarcely denominate him the hero-.of our story. Travelling in Australia in those days was in bullock-carts or drays, and the joutlny to Ballarat could be mado in about four days, more or lees, as the bullocks pleased, ,and the stato of t. o road admitted. Your bullock is an animal t'at makes his own pace, and you can't get him out of it in a hurry. lle is nlaster of the aituation, and ho knouws it. So you can mmnlage, pelrhap, fifte-n inileoa day crampiog-out at night and sleeping on the ground under a tarpaulin, or, perhaps, a teint, or, perhaps, under the open canopy of healven-on your way to the " diggings." B:tllarat diggings ],reser.ted quite n novel spec. tacle to tLe four friends who had come out to make their fortunes, which they did not. quite succeed in doing - ai narrow v'alley', fring. d with trees, a " creIk " linning through it, the banks of which ire crowded with huts ar,d tents, and wooden lhanties. In every direction near the crelek or stream were hundreIs, cven thous.inds, of men at work. This was the "City of Lillhuatl," and the inhabitants thereof were digging, ratrying, "cradling," or earth-washing, as hard as they could go. 'lhu ouoise wios as great as if hundreds of Ehuttles were at worlk, and the whole side of the favourite hill was as busy as an a nt setth ient. The first thing to do was to obtain a licence, for which money had to be paid, and this was issued with the condition that only eight feet EqiuaR Were worked tat one lime by tihe party licensed. IIoles were tdriven in all directions, and some etlterprising spirits wore at work with knives, and piclkiing uip gold as if on the ground of Mlr. Thom'llas Tiddler of pleasant memory. The place for thi tent having sLeen sclceted, ts.o food was prrtp?red, and then our oadventurers went to pitch upon Ii "likely rpot." " Itad any hluck; " ail one (,t the new cotetrs to a lad who ha:is come out with hiis not long Iefore. " Aye, plenty," reilied the youth, with a heaoning face. " i?een" here narly sia ~ ee.ksI, and rado about five hundred Ioutlds. Iltter than stan'dirg behind a counter in England." Five htundred pounds! 'This was news. S?elton did not it first credit it, but subl,ls'tutnt oeperienco convinced hinl of the piosvihility of the " tind." T'ho :ace was e hosen andl the nliti seCt to olork. They were not very Isucces:ful, hut they welonew hands, and hardly utnderstuod the " cradilling." But they soon got expert, and nrode a fair " haul." Net witllstanditng tilo gold, Skelton wts by no nuatr.s h:ppiy. Ito crou!tt nilust at at nglut, for the noioe at first disturbl t him, and his thlltights then camo to trouble him. What w.th the continuotus firin,' the Langing of drumt, or ia "tti" p'tinig, the alamg conllsequcnt t upon a but cilte ing fire, or some such incident, disturbed him greatly. One Sunda:y aflter three months' digging (and Sunday -was "always a; dray of rest at Biltlarat) Sht:ltoi's couttlrynant, " Hiou-gh Robeit," tas they oaltkd him, wll reading tan old neowspalper heo had brought up with hinm frontm Melbourne. Augustus was seated within the tent thlikinking, as he wuas wont to do. t Although he had only been in the colony a few monthsr, he was lIcog;ng for news of home. The weeks had piecd ed very quickly; nothing had trans lired to ~alarm him, and he was 1leginning to feel more secure. But with this feeling of security c'ame Ia dlesire to revisit the scea hor he hd so lately left-to seo how thingo were going on. As toldiera off duty will stand in the baerack-yard to watch the parade in which they have taken pat t a hMndted times, as I a(orT tuld actresses will frequent a theatre when not required upon their own boards, so in like mrlnner Skelton wtas irresistibly attracted towards home, or anything to tell hiill othomlno-patrticulhirlyof Ieechy. coul. The p'l ier his "ch' um" was reading that afternoon was a county paper, and heo had recognised it nt t n lance. 

 ilo actually quivered with suppressed anriety and excitement when his companion turned round and asked him if he know the county well, and if heo had over been to I)ranton. SSkelton admitted that he had been in that part of the county, and inquired why his friend asked. " Because," replied the man, " there seems to bo quito an excitement there. A young equiro is miss. ing. The huo and cry is after him. His father also has disappeared under mysterious circumnstances; and they say there's fifty pounds reward for news of the youing man. lie is believed to he in Australia." "' hy did ho run away F?" inquired Skclton. turning nick in dread of the answer. "Doesn't sAy in this paper; it presumnesito readers know all about it. Well, tifty pounds is not picked up every day, eoven here, and I wouldn't mind earn. ing it for iuch a lpiece of information, Ch, mates ?" 11e concluhdd with some choico languago by way of emphasis. "No concern 'of ouron what he did," replied a neighbour, who had been listening. "I've had cursed bad luck, andl would give up anybody for fifty pounds, even ifo h hadn't committed. it crino." Augustus could not repress a start at thenoe words. Th'e penaker was in earnest; no doubt ho would deliver him up. Rough l ocb noticed tkolton'o anxiety. " Wha, crime f" exclaimed tho unhappy mam. "There is no question of crimo at all." " People don't run away without a reaoon," aid one of Skclton's oompanions. " But n0o, mant, yo didn't read all. There's a further roward of one hundred pounds for his production to the nearest onagintrate, Law, don't 1 wilsh I had him hero !" " Might at well uook a needlo in a bundle of hay no try to find a man in Australia," replied Skolton, turmng into the chndo of the tent quaking with fear, and afraid to ask for the paper n1ow. IBut the others had noticed hin uneasiness, and looked at naeh other. "What's his name, Robort " anstcl a miner. "' Augustus Skelton, Esquiro, of the Grange, and of Moor Farm, in the county of - . Quito a gentleman.'" The description is, unfortunately, toro away partly, but ho's tallish and not had looking, nnd-well, it ain't very plain-bunt I think I should know him if I mot him near a magistrato's house." Thlis, asn my be imagined, was really pleasant for Augustus, who knew from whlnt ho had anlready seon of lis comrades that thoy would not hesitate to denounce him ; for, rough na they were, they wore not by any mean0s averse to wrong, and, thoughi they would not betray a aun for gain, they would amsiest the government " in hunting dlawn it felon if thereby they gained a lsubstantial roeognitien. iunt lhi E?gli?lnian frain Skhelton's own e-inity w different. lien enpected that solmething woi wiroini , and when all tlle rest lind moved away he seatedi himself besidn Augnust s and salld quietly : "l Have you any idn a who this man is fur whom the reward in offered i " "If How can I toell ?" was lhe reply.

" Well, T seupploe it must be murder, or they voulhlt offer it rewarnd,' replied Shellon, iniansily. lio was half inclined to m'trn, this moan, and hallt inoliucd to bravo it out. " W\\liat do you thlink " "I thinl nothing; but as a friemt I wouldni't c.dvit anyone undter enuch a euspiciolt to riemlain hero. The fOellnv are pretty rough, but in their

As Amoa gazecd he saw the black spot tamove and thr'n make its wiv hIoldly and isteadily to land by swuimmning down the setl of lthe eddy in the miniature bay to land. lThe ianrot, hohti ttold anlt troug?, wat a woman, anti ia cihe breasted the ripple of the watetr her long hair floated behind her like ceaworv , and lo mliutight have been a mormaild, had ouch things over hautnted tho unpoetical precincts of Bransleton.

 " h, Amos!" cried the girl. " .Then it is really you? Save me. l've been cruelly treated. I fell off the cliff." "Off the cliff," murttieed Amuo, as be tupported the ecxhausteld gil, who, now that c le ran daf, veoemed about to give na y. " You lfll off bly your Lslf " " No,"he gaspled, " and yet--ch, I dore not thinia of it. It clanot be thet he m?int to lkill me. No, no.

For Amos had suddenly reanviembnred the hat he had found floating, :and had cursled the owner. " I hoe,o his evil crrcaas is at tho bottom of the bhai.ni.l,' he said. " Can h swimir ?" " a hot" inquircd Ellena, releasing h.avelf from Amos's tcndcr support and sitling down upon a atone. " Wiry, the coward who left you here to swim or nintk. Didn't lhe conme in after you ?" " No. I fell. 1 slipped, ael he, I believe, tried to tave Inc. I rernemtiber he clutched at may drce, and the ribbon broke, and-I fell." Here Ellen became aware that the hoasom of lher dress was some.what disordercd and heC blushinuly attempted to put it to rights. Amos turlncd aside, and then asked, " Who is hI ? 'Tcllme, Nelie, tell mne, that I may break every bone in his cowardly carcans. Quick, has?, out with it." Ellen rose with como difficulty and -aid: "Amos, for mny sake do not be so violent. Forgive him. Ile did not intentionally injure me. Now lot nu go home, for we c;annot relnain here longer." " You had better waila. If you cit in the boat you will surely co.th cold. Come, let people soay all they can. Neow for it." Ellen roeo, and, suppolrted by the strong arm of amos, coon reached the summit of the cliff, they made their way to old Mlarthr's cottage, near the MIoor lFarm, which was within i more reasonable dietance, as well as being less public than Deechycombe. "Old Marth ha ll take core of you for a bit, and I'll come back for ye," said Amos tenderly to Ellen. She looked so beautiful in his distress that lhe could -carcely withdraw his gaze, and her speaking eyes met lin. "Nellie, dear Nellie," he whispered, "I sam thorough glad I raw you when I did. Suppeos any thing had happened to ye. Yousnaved mp life once." " You have saved mine now," she replied, hastily. "I could not believe it could be yoat, Amos; and when I easw you I was so glad." "I had got out of the police-station, you sec, ard i--- "I tais ao glad," continued Ellen, " for I knew I could rely upoan you. Now, you must make me ia pTromise, Amos." "Anyt?hing you like, dear, but one thing, and thlat is albout the scoundrel who-" "Amos," said Ellen, quietly, as they camne near the cottage, "you nusLt not say any more. "We must learn to forgive our cuenmies. But now, hero is Martha'm cottage. Will you come back in a couple of hours? If you think you can, for they will be after you again, won't they "F' "I don't care," replied Anmos, defiantly. " Let them como, and welcome. I'll be hero in a couple of hours, when your things are dry, and I'll take you horne." "''Thank you," lae replied, pressing his hand. "Good-bye, now. nRemembeuryour promino." She cnutred the cottage quickly, and very much surprised old Martha, who, however, did not waste time in conjectures naor talking till Ellenu nn wawarm!ly 

 tucked up in bed, and her raturated clothing drying by the replenished fire in the little kitchen. Then, and not till then, did IMartha give vent to her almost overwhelming curiosity in a rapid series of questions. Ellen did not give her very much satisfaction. 'Tiu reaction had come rapidly, and before slho had been inbeod five minutes the warm decoction ad. ministered by the old nurse had acled a a an opiato on her nerves. Ellen was Boon in a sourd sleep, leaving Martha to sit by the fire and watch the dry ing of the clothes until such timo as the beautiful patient should awake. " the is a pretty dear, that she is," muttered the old woman, a's rho watched the she ping g girl, whoso luxuriant hair was scattered bountifully across the homely pillows. One hand, and part of a beautifully forelld arm, wna lying outside the patch-work counrterpane, and the white throat and curving bosom were partly unfolded to the motherly gaze of the old nursP. " Laws a' mercy i" murmured tihe woman,shaking her head, " I never sco such ia strange likeness in my born day,. I could declareo as she wer-yes, deary, it's only me.---" Ellen was awake, her blue Cyes opened clear and penetrating; then, in quick astonish. mernt, hoe sat up. " Oh, MarthI, I was dreaming. I thought I was drowning-in the sea. Was 1 restless P" " No," replied thel old wvoman; " you were lying likoe a lamb-as ouiet as vo could bo. So you fell in tihe wat,:r, and Anmo pulled you out. IHe is a good lad, is AnuoS." "1 H is, indeed. If it had not been for his coming acroes I don't think I could have bhad courage to get Sshore. He's comting Lak:l for me." "No doubt, no doubt. Iie's a likely ladl, ho is, antd known a pretty face ; and yours is a pretty one too. Ah I beanty is a snare, after all." " Como, Martha, I can't help my looks. I daressy you wero pretty \\hen yvo wore yeungr ; you Know you didn't think no their I " "' No, I didn't; but it rwas a enaro to- me. Dear, dorn, Io tlhinlk of it now I1 might have bocn the miistress of the tMoor had I liked-the Moler Farm." "T You, Martha I How ? Tell me." "Anotherr tirr---rno time. John Skelton courted mo--that's all. Bult your clothes is dry; and if yo can get up it won't hurtl, yo to have some thing to eat. I'll get it for your tea, and Anton will he lreu soon, so get ye ready. Ho's a likely young man, and a good husbandl for yo." " Oh, Martha i \\'hat nonenso you're tallking," replied Ellen, blushing down to her throat at the iorinuation. " Will you bring me my things, plnso ?" "Aye, aye, nonsouse indeed! It's always non sense till the young man pats his arnm around yo, iaud you conrent to it. Then it's earnest enough, m)y girl, and only human natur with the blessin' of Ctod." Ellen remained very thoughtful while she dresseod, and hadil crcarely completed her toilette when Martha came into the bedraoom and told her that ten was ready, and that Amos wnu weaitirng-o-f which l:tter, fact Ellen's heart had ailreadv pprlised hero ten minutes before, and had causedl tier to prolong her appearance in the little sitting-room ius far as possible. Ultc when she did appear, so radiant after her refreshing cleep-- lushing with a ceonsciousness of which rho was but faintly aware, even t meetcling Amis, and at his by no neaons corncealed gaz of admiration--tlhen Ellen b'lrgan to think that nMrtha had some alight ground for ther insinuations, and that perhlap she had niot. een talking such ultter nonsense alttr tll !
