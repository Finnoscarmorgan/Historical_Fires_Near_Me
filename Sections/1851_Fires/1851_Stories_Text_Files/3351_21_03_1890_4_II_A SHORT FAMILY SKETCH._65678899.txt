ARTHUR LANDON, THE AUSTRALIAN BUSHMAN. Br ANGUS MACLEAN (Uontinoed from our last.) CHAPTEB I. The reader has no doubt alreadyrecognised our hero, Arthur Landon, in the person of fit ouona uehmar who. arrived so oppor. la e �; and eo^"herteay. reerard tha tittle Nina from the jaws of the devouring element en" Blacok'Th ursday." Arthur London, though yonug and not very attractive in ap pearance, polseseed may qualiieie which, in she bosh of Anstralia, would entitle him to thbe claims of a hero. Brooght up under the watchful eyes of fond and virtoons parents, and natuoroy brave and honorable in his disposition, poseseinlg most accomplish. ments necessary.for a bold and thoroogh bushman-these advantages, combined with a warm and affectionate heart, made him already a great favorite with all who knew him. His father, George Landon, being of re spectable parents in the mother country, took hi. passage ou ti Sydney when Arthus -who war the eldest of the family-was bul two years old. His mother had been married before to a young member of family d the aristocracy, and an heir to an estate, butni died suddenly after the birth of an only daughter, leaving his young widow-whom he married against the consentatof his parents -neprovided for. SHis relations took charge of his infant danughter in order to bring her up in a manner becoming an heiress to an estate. The widow. thus uncured for by her late husband's relatives., at last consented to be come George Landon's wife-be being a soitor or heresbefore her edet marriage- This last art closed the hearts of her fest hue band's friends against her, and deprived her uS ever receiving any favors at their hands. George Lsndon. whose means were not adequate to keep the style to whict he and his wife were aecustomed in their former days. and before all their little capital should exhauated they resolved on emirating to Ane-s. tralia in order to better their cirecmstances. There theyrcould pot up with oanny icon- vrniencee, and belfree from the critical gaze of the fashionable world. Gorgr Landon had not calculated on the hoeavy eilpenees of oufit and passage mony. and on arriving in Sydney he found Lis emall eapital at a far lower head than he anticipated. He, how ever, possessed a mantel heart and pereever ing mind, which made op for lope of capital After remaing a short time in Sydney, he had been advieed tu purchabe a few head of cattle and horses, and to find some gracing country whore they might increase in a short time. But alter porchasiog the stock hs found out by experiencs that the grazing' country ,wa not altogether Bn easily die '.-mvsoed as hed epected, asa., sler shifting from one plaee to another, beat last found some rough cointly in the Manaroo ditrict, at the foot of the Australian Alps. In this wild region he settled down with his stock for a short time, when he was joined by a decent and industrious Irishman named Haley, who had been lately married tos nicecountry girl of his own. Being within four miles of each other, and their runs joining. thebs two small equatters became agreat help and protection to one another. Thus they lived for years on the best footing and in perfect harmony,while their families and stoek iocreased. They bad to go through a good deal of hardship, as may be expected, for the frst years of their Equatting. until their children grew op. But that secour came by degrees, especially to Landon, as Arthur soon became an aetive and usefual lad in the btash among the stock. Haley was not no fortunate, for his eldest child was a daughter, and four years Arthur London's junior. Nevertheless Kathleen Haley soon became seaful, and could ride as well through the wild ranges as any yonng stockman in Aus trlias, for she had an excellent tutor in Arthur who took great pains in her rensrt rian instructions. Arthur also gave Haley often a hand in mnstering, branding, and looking after his stock, as well as his own father's; and as Kathleen-who was growing up rery fast like all other native girls-rode with him on these occasions, a closeintimacy sprung up between them which at last de veloped into a more tender feeling. We have already given an imperfect sketch of Arhr'esloohs and, althongh they were not calculated to make a "heavy imprestion"on a female's heart, nevertholeoe Kathleen Haley discoverd certain attractioons in her yoang neighbor's bronzed visage and piercing black eyes. Although ahe kept these impressions sealed within her young and virgin bosom, she often acknowledged to herself that Arthur was the only "perfect" young man that she ever beheld. Nothing was done properly on less he had a hand in it. She would not ride a young colt unless he had the breaking of it in. Her saddle, bridle, or any other little article belonging to her riding gear must pass through his hands; and even her habit and other dresses had to be left to his judgment before bshe could wear them. We most not therefore be surpriesed that with all the confidences placed in him byhis fair neighbor, Arthur could not resist loe ing Kahleen. In. addition to such strong al inth on bis affuetionsthere were far greater charms connected with thcyoung!ady, which wouald prove fatal to a more experienced heart than our hero's, for Kathleen Haley was oe of the moat beautiful and lodly sreatnres that the world ever produced. To give even a vague idea of her looks is not in thepowerof mypen todescribe;the reader, therefore, must form in his own mind a being possessed of alt the beauty and innocence of ueo first mother before her tall. The gclden treEsses. falling in their wanton and natural state around the swan-like neck and shoulders. The pure and healthy rose which mantled the blooming eheeko; the spackling and betwitehigtwiankle of the dark blhe eyes; the eweet and enchantiog smile of the full and pouting lips, which rivalled the redness of a cherry; the well-set and exquisite ivory teeth; the well-rounded end child-like chin, and the broad, but not too high, marblebrow, and, above all, the elastic and graceful form, whore unrivalled mould was ravishing to be hold, when its fair owner rodedo with such con gdene and case her epirited steed over all the obstacles which the wild and hilly ooun try presented.

 -ritacity, as the wild osrh of Australia. The exciting and healthy exercise they in. dalgo in, riding sptrited horses over rough dangerous .country, brings forth all their ronrage and nerve, and gives them that blooming appearance of countenance and to their eyes that sparklitng and bril. liant light. The Atrnrlin n native girls brooght up under the earefol gnordianshiphof virtuous and pios. parents, notrammelled by the formal and artifeial natoms of town societies; their heats and minds on. contaminated and ounorrupted by worldly scandal or the sednotiva whispers of the noprincipled libertine, live on thir own pore atmosphere of perfect innocence. Snch nharactes may be rare, yet there are sme, and Kathleen was ene of the sumber. She had enjoyed all those advantages which improve the virgin mind and inetruot it in all those moral habits so conhdure to avirtoos liWe,for, besides her own parents' nimpenachable example, the mom ladylike and refioed manners of Mrs. Landon Arthsr's mother-inspired the fertile mind and quick perception of asthleen Haley with high and lofty principles rarely met with in thu bosh. After giving the above sketch of the fair eathleen. we mosat not leave in the shade another beautifnl dower in this wild forest. Elita-or Lizzie she was more often etlled Arthur Laodon' eldest sister, and a dear friend of Kathleen Haley's. LiztzieLondon, although of quite a different east of beauty, was to some people's laste more lovely. Her hair, eyes and eyebrows were black like her brother Alrthur's, but her shin was a white and por as the driven snow, without any colore in her countenane save a slight delicate shade when riding or taking ex seat... H- Irer see and figure -ware fault less, and there was an irresistible expreesion of lafngor in er liquid black eyes which gave a charm to her pale ountenance, and filled the soul of the beholder with admira tion. Liorie's manner and temperament was mom refned and meek,wilh leas epright. lines and vivacity than her fair neighbour and companion, Kathleeo. She was also more timid in riding, and her whole harac. teriotire were more reserved and ladyalibe propably after her mother, whore pelished manner she strictly imitated. she seldom rode with Arthr and Kathleen over the ranges when alter stock, except on special measipns, and for exerise orpleasonre. We must not omit to mention herm that thee two lovely flowers did not spring tp without some nrcessarny culture, for theirn parents-partiunlaly Mrs. Landon - not withetanding ths peesure of household notee, taoo every opportunity of teaching their hildren, o that they could read ane write welle lArthur upplied them with books; cwhen. ever he paid a visit to any village or town he invariably bought a supply, among which were some of the boot and latest novele of ths day, and we must admit that "Scott," "Balwer," and some celebrated lady writers had a share int forming the yong minds of these beanutifl children of nature. Thus they grew sp in their innocence and loveliness, nconscioas of their many charme and that their graceful forms were develop. ing and verging on womanhood, until Arthur etuornedfrom his trip to Melbourne after "Black Thursday," when thsy had attained their thirteenyears. We must now enlighten the readerl as to the reason or business whirh brought our hero to Melbourne, and which directed him toswards the Upper Plenty as referred ston the iarst oapter. Arthur had been several times before this entrulted with the sale of his father's and Haley's stuck, both in Tworold bay and ippasland markesets, where he disposed of them at satisfactory prices, considering the times. Blt this season, as these places did not offer ay indyocement regording prices of stock, he -accompanied a notable dealer namet Japck Trenton-or Tantram as he was often styled-asnd who wilt mae a prominent tre in our tale. Arthur aeeeord ingly joined his mob with these ef the eels. brated Tantrum, and, after a fatiguing and esacrhing tourney threugh the" seanowy mountains, oippsla cc. and Ferntree gullies," arrived at last in th gret metroe. polls of Victoria. Unfortunately, at thai time, and before the golden era which was soon to fellow, the markes were gluatted, so that they were obliged to wait until, a rise in stack should tabe place, and hadtherefore to send them to a paddock situaeted on the Plenty, from which esme' of "the hbarte broke eel and strayed to the rages. Arthur had been in search of them on chat memorable morning,, when the buehfires drove him out. The reader is already informed of .he narro eseape be had on that occasion, and all we have got to say sow is huw he toted after leaving Mr. Whitford'e-or rather COlder's residence. His garments were still wet, as may be supposed, after his long soaking in the pond, but this, instead of discomoding him, proved a great comfort on such a scorching day. His horse aiso benefied by the bath be took. and carried its well-u' perieneed rider safely to Melbourne, from whence hbe ent a medical man in post baste to the poou invalid. It must be remembered hers that our hero's thoughts dwelt upon many specula. tions while on the way to town. The straong impressions made upon his sensitive mind by the invalid mother and her little daughter occurred to him on every occasion; nor could he drive her beautiful and delirate looks from his eyes; But her voice held a more powerful iwprersion or his imaaina tion, "Mow very like my mother's voicel" was an expression which often escaped his lips "~Andthat sweet littls girl; how fond I gut of her all at once," ha would add, and the whole event appeared so strange and mysterious. A few days after thie the strayed horses were found, and an improvement in the stack market had taken place. They nccord. ingly dieposed of the whole mob at a fair prim. Our here, although a very abstemious youug mao, enjoyed himeelt on his first trip to the city. Every novlry presented is that grand place was observed and imprinted on his mind vividly, particulsrly the playe at the theatre. "Romeo and Jolirt" had been enacted on cur of these occarieone and our hero, who took great delicht in reading Shakespeare's plays, for the first time beheld them acted. He reuereq tly took immense delight in the rams, and determiced'to stdre upin his mind thbt and all-other soveltiem he had seen, is order- to repeat-them te his sister Lizzy and playmate Kathleen. Not. withstanding the fne dresses and ether artifcial improvements in the persons and faces of the Melbaurne ladies, he could not see any among them who could rival Rath. teen in beauty as ha thought. But she was only a childas yea, in his imagination, whom he had known trom infancy. Thusheergued to himeelf until hisreturn home. (To be Continued:)
