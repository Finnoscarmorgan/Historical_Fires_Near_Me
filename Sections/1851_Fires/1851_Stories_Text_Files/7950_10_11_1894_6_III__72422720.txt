A TALE OF BLACK THURSDAY. 

 BY GERALD GORDON. 

 CHAPTER III. 

 For some days. tyork had v been entirely suspended;' ; . All thecountry was on fire for miles I'oundi" arid a change of wind was feared which would in all probability carry ihe tire before it towards the camp. In that case it would be necessary to . throw every thing that f-would'be inflammable into the SHi ie.i of little ponds still dignified by the 

 name of the creek. 

 Every night the sun sank u dull crimson ball, the very "edg'6s"blurred by tile smoke. Every morning Pollock ami the others rose hoping against hope for .rain, only to find the hard, dry earth a little more parched than it had been before, lying hard and bare under u sky wlioHe clouds, hf-uvy though they were, were only smoke.' All colour seemed burnt from the vegetatiou ; grass, there was none to apeak of. 

 At night there was a dull lurid glare against the northern sky, and in patches bright gleaming fires, obscured by day by the 

 heavy smoke which rolled down before thej "Wlndand-praclatmedtlieiifrerte srtU'lmvrtltigr 

 And then one morning, as Crowle, the . eldest of the two probationers, emerged from his tent, he saw at once that something un usual was on hand, and ' hurried over to where Smith, the. cook, was rapidly serving out the breakfast, not troubling this particu lar morning to lay the rough wooden table, but handing to each one of the party bread, aneat, and a pannikin of tea. 

 It was very dark-almost as if a violent thunderstorm was impending-the sky was all one dome of lead, deepening near the horizon to slaty purple. What hud been dreaded for days had come to pass ; the wind had changed and was sweeping down to wards the little camp . a vast wave of fire, threatening to destroy it. 

 Pollock was clear-beaded and throughly practical, and in a few moments had set everyone to work, and although he did more than his own fair share, lie : had an eye to each one of the'others, keeping Smith well at it, he.being the firat one to show signs of flagging."' Crowle was on the outside' edge, nearest'the creek. 'Such hard work had : never fallen to him before, but ? he battled away manfully, till his arms/ached with wielding the heavy branch ; and the smoke made eyes and nostrils smart almost unbear ably.' And even as be seemed to make some little progress against the fire, it would spring up close to his feet, having run along the ground in a tiny tongue almost like wateiy catching at single dry twigs or blades of grass. . 

 Now and again Pollock's voice cried out cheerily, though somewhat houisely, 'Keep at it, boys ?" or " We're making headway." But for. the, most part everyone worked silently, for tongues and throats were dry, and thpy saved their breath ; and then again they had to shout'tq be heard at all, for there was . the ? crackle of the burning twigs and leaves, the crush . and swish of the brnnohes, and above all, like a deep Imss, continuous, unceasing, the dull, hungry roitr of?.?the -approaching-fire;--; At times Orowle' could not see at all, andj with one anii across, his face, covering! his eyes, 'ran- back before the heavy burping'sniofce;1 which would belch out - suddenly- through ' some channel' sin' the undergrowth, and be ~ followed by- sharp tongues of fire. It would have needed an army ? to have done any real wbrk.agiiinst such a fire as that, and even then it is doubt ful if .it could . have-been stemmed for tiify length of time; to stop it would have -been impossible.. ???<?. . 

 All;'Or'owlcV energies Wore .directed now on a patch of blazing bracken and swoid grass,which lay in the. open surrounded* by belts of .saplings .and occasional full grown trees. ? His arms-ached, his palms were blis tered,- his tongue <.was a so* dry- that, he felt choked. In the "tallei; , trees' the ;fire was spreading, the bracked .was charred and ground to grey powder under his feet. His branch caught fire, the leaves blazed iip, close at, hand thele was ' nothing from which to drag a new. one, and what he had in his hands was now a useless pole ; the fire was gaining on him fast, there was nothing for it now ? but to- throw himself on the ground where sword.'-grass and bracken had blazud itself out, and let. the fire pass round .him. He lay- as,flat as possible,"feeling how hot the earth was, his'head buried in his hands. Ib grew hotter and hotter.; the roar of the fire seemed louder; for <a few.moments all air seemed; exhausted, and. he gasped for breath, . raising, his band, and seeing with dim, smoke1 blinded eyes, a towering lirp, holding in its embrace skeleton trees stripped of every leaf and tiny twig. ? Thanks to the wind it passed quickly, and ho rose a few minutes later, gasping, choking, but unhurt, save for a singeing, part" of which included his eyelashes and eyebrows. 

 The same -wave of Kre-rolled along until nearlynp to the cunip, but Pollock was all attention, and called evetyone from the beat ing out;: and tents were struck in. less time ' tlmn-'they , had ever ' been'before, �nd were pitched, with everything.- the . uien could lay their hands on, into the creek. . 

 Bessemer called after his-mate, however, as he with the others was retreating towards water. . . . - t ? 

 I say;Orowle, just a second like'a good fellow; give us a hand with'my box.' 

 Crowle was not particularly willing. 'Let it stay, he said. ' See , the;fire has passed right under the dray; and done it no harm.' 

 - ' Oh, never , mind -the, dray, take ? hold of the handle,'come'along, and let's run fot it.' 

 And run they did, as well as two young sters might, with.so weightyia:piece of furni ture ; and when they got close to the bankr pursued by the flames as.thoy ran, they gave it a . one, two, three ! and slung it into the creek, following it themselves, and not a moment too soon, for the walls of dense scrub, ou either side ofytlie water, absolutely parched and withered .with 'continuous heat, 

 now took fire, and, roared and crackled tre mendously. . - 

 The boys joined the rest of the party in sitting astride a huge log that had fallen into the creek, and laughed heartily as Smith came panting down the bank', the. fryingpan over his shoulder,": Why he' brought- it it would be difficult to say, probably force of - habit;. but Pollock, making room for him. be hind him on the log.' at once put itto practi cal use, , for no sooner was Smith astride than be. received his orders,1 ? 

 ' Fill your fryiugpan and showor me with water,' and this was done repeatedly, Smith' puffing like a grampus as he bent over to till the paA- Occasionally the others got-a few drops, but only enough to be tantalizing, for although from their-feet.to' their knees tkey were in the water the rent of their poor worn'out bodies seeuied roasting as they Bat betweap the two walls of burning scrub. Their turn came later, however, and the fryingpan wan passed along from hand to 

 hand. - 

 There Was a continual hissing; sound SM blazing leaves and twigs fell into the water.' The tieico light dazzled their eyes, and now and again little hot puffs of air made - them cough, and with-one accord they rubbed, grimy blackened faces with grimier,, blacker Imuds. The drops of water had' made little clean streaks here and there ; aiuT trickled from felt hats on to dark beards .and mous ' taches. . The tire passed at length, and they got off the log to examine the site'of their" ctimp., . . 

 All the evening was devoted^to hauling tents, cordage, <fec., out of the bed of the cieuk. The boys', tent was pitched , with great difficulty, it wag_ sb heavy.: with water and uiud,. so awkward to handle^; but-it "was lixed at length, pegs were hammered in, cords tightened, and they set to work to scrub it down with brushes. The men didi without their tent, and Pollock betook him self to a neighboring homestead for. the night. 

 Bessemer was very anxious about the 'in strument ' which be had left for safety at a squatter's homestead, for no place seeihed safe that night. The tent was as wet could be, but it was cool, and as evaporation set in, all the cooler. The boys lay down on the dust and ashes inside, and did not- mind too much the constant drip, drip"from the ridge pole.. They were young, and knew rheuma tism only by repot t j young as .they were, however, ana tired out as they were, they could not sleep. Smith gave them a panni kin of tea apiece at the tail of the blackened dray, and then they crept into the tout again.. 

 All. that night, trees were falling withtthe crash . of thunder, and the stars overhead; were blurred by drifting clouds of f)uioke.j There was the fear of a'giant tree standing-, outside falling on the tent.,Bessenierwisbed; to shift again, but Orowle flatly refu'stid^ ancT; laughed at him as he rose at least' a dozen i times, 'to. see,' as he phrased it, if the/ beastly thing was " all right.' It? was safe enough ; it took fully two days to burn'right through, and then fell with a mighty crash 

 'By the way, what treasures had; you in ' your box ?' asked Orowle as morning dawned, and they niade; their way, to the creek for a wash. " . I 

 ' Some handkerchiefs ; a girl in England marked for me,' replied Bessemer' despon dently. 

 ' Handkerchiefs 1' Orowle laughed. ' Was that all. They were pretty heavy ones.' 

 ' Oh, there was gunpowder there too ; that weighed it down a bit.' 

 ' Orowle didn't laugh this time, but he gave his friend a piece of his mind, and commented pretty strongly on the folly of carrying a box of gunpowder through a tire. -:-~ '? That morning ufter breakfast he and Besse mer made a reconnaissance, and: viewed the i'uiued country, at their leisure. It,, was-like the'day' after a ? battle. - The face' of-the country was completely- changed j for xnil^s the -heavy scrub was entirely destroyed.. Gaunt trees still smouldered, and piles , of . logs, stripped-ofall branches, blazed steadily. 

 The number of .roasted and half rousted, 

 kangaroo and. wallaby was extraordinary.' Birds,'too, and opossums without end. The fire' still burned heavily in the ranges, and the heat, .was sweltering. 1 Olouds of white' smokr swept ,down.. on the boys as they trudged :along .over.- the blackened, burnt,; brittle stubble. . . Whole flocks of parraquets and parrots fell dead or dying, each with, a heavy. thump. The ouly birds that sailed apparently uninjured through the- dense 

 clouds of sinoke were the eagle-hawk, the crow, and the magpie,'and for-the two former, it was feast day, as they swooped and plunged on the dead, and dying below theu, 

 ' . The settlers had had heavy losses." Twenty-' 

 five thousand slieep were turned into roast mutton ..not far. away, five poor horses so terribly burnt that they had; to be shot; and, worse than all, some people were drowned in a; waterhole while trying to get a'dritik arid: cool themselves. First a, little boy fell in, then /another, and the father, jumping in after tliem, succeeded in saving'neither,1'and; was drowned himself before the eyes' of his agonised wife.
