"Of courso'not," answered thelInspec ter, soot!iingly, for his visitor wasbegin ing-to chow signs of indignation at the thought of aniyonenimpnstingmii ercenary motives to her late lover. " From what I have heard of Charles Edgar. Ibelieve him to have been a kmind-hearted, excellent young man, and I hope, Miss Devereaux; tlat we will, are long, find him alive and well." lie said this to console the poor girl, for her wan face and wistful manners touched him.. "Gobd grant that you may," :iso fcri:ntly replied, and then the Inspec for accompanied her to the door, as she wishied to'go. .. " Lynx Will hbe here at nine o'clock to morrow mrning, and if you will give me your address I will lend 1him to you" "Union HIioel, Collins-street," she answered, and then departed with a heavy heart; for apparently the author ities- were quite in the dark regarding her lnver'ej fate.. Next morning tthe, detective called on her, but he had very little to tell. Ho was still at work' on the case; but he found it an extremely difficult one, and could not even get a peg to hang atheory on as. he expressed it. Hope, which " springs eternal in the human breast," however, whispered that success would crown his efforts in the end, and he was sanguiue that ere long he would solve the mystery. lie gave Miss Devereaux instructions lhow to reach Mr. Rennie's selections, but excused himself from accompanying her by saying that his presence would not be agreeable to the young man, and would look like a menace. This was pplpably true, and by the first train next day Adeline Devereaux reached Woodend, and, hiring a vehicle irom the Commercial Hotel, set out for Csmpaspe in the company of a driver who knew the district. .OHAPTER X. THE neRE SELECTOR. Victorian legislators as a rule do not Stand high in the estimation of the more thuoghtful portion of the commuiity. 9ccasionally a demagogue rises who with L,ib promises to the masses attains a etr morary popularity not warranted by ,e A. ts he places on the Statute Book, hut tat'ug our Houses of Parliament in General tWtir members have done much , deserve , 'w respect of the people. -i-suredly one of the most beneficial '? ps that was ever taken to ensure the :rsaperity of Vu ' oria was the system of Sce land selection,u ,which was inaulgu 'I ,td in the '"ixties.

If the axiom that an Englishman's l",,ne is his castle be true, how much ',,re forcibly may it be applied to the 'was who owns the fee simple of the soil surrounding his house. Such ownership produces a sense of in O:pendence which cannot fail to raise the taidard of mankind in the country "ehichalloas such an opportunity to its inhabitants.

 Rennio, solemnly assured him that he woubhld make ite his life's task to lift the shadow :thit had thus auddenly fallbn across their lives, 'adil darkened the future of both, and with this assurance the old man departedl, feeliing that as long as 'Rennie lived no effort would be- spared :to' solve 'the -strange pro bleiu. Duringthe first, rush of land selection it was not necessary to go far inland for a suitable area, and Rennie had a bewilder ing choice of good lots. The stigma of guilt. however, which was attached to him by his fellow men, and which the newspapers gave wide publicity to by many insinuations,i made him to: some extent a misanu thrope. His gregarious instincts had, 'for the time,been effaced by the ruthless hand of the slanderer and the false judgment his fellow men had formed of him, and lie decided to withdraw as much as possible from'the world, that is, as much as would be consonant with his desire 'to unravel the mystery of Charles Edgar. The mountain peaks of Macedon and Diogenes'possessed.a fascination for him, and he felt uneasy when out of sight of these towering land marks. His quest for land, coinmbined with his desire toiavoid the busy haunts of men, led ,his -ootsteps into the heart of the Black Forest, and about ten miles from 3Iacedoii, and in full view of the mounts, at the source of the Campaspe river, lie decided to settle.' The locality at that time was indescrib ably wild. Immense trees grew so thickly that in soine places the beams of the'sun. never penetrated., In; spots, patches .had beam cleared away by the great whirlwind of fire on Black Thursday, which rivaged the cole-. brated forest . . Choppy ranges and narrow valleys serrated .the country like 'the teeth of a saw, and left out small tracks'of flat' laid:; 'The 'soil as, however, excel-, lent.: , The wood cutter and the saw'-imiller had 'begun their workf :siubdiuiug the. forest on different sides of RennieU'selec tion, butsorime milis 'firihii. i ' . :Towards WVoodend the i timberr nws being :rapidly' sent'`o Mlelboiurnie; whil:'. the mining districts of 'Blackwood -and Daylesford - were 'graduallv. exteniding their clearitiga into thle primeval woods.:. .

The head of the Campasple,' :silih, rising in the heart of'the'forestr;tlows through the fertile'districts of Carlsrhue, Kyneton, past. Bendigo," and over the. northern plains of Elmore and Roclicster' into the Murray at Echuca, was a romani tic and beautiful spot. Starting from a clear" spring it in a short distance is augmented to a peren nial stream. .FlowigS over a rocky bed the water is so crystal like that the small black fish, with `which it abounds, can be plainly seen swimming around at a depth of five 'or six feet, while 'the tiny-so called trout-float, visible like amber specs; at even a' greater depth. In a distance of five' oes from the source there are no : less than four water falls of surpassing loveliness. At these places the solid rock has by some means been scooped out, probably by the wishing away of soft strata, and the inever-ceasisg action of the .water. has caused, the most curious and gro tesque formations., Some of them :rise out of their liquid bed, statle like, :as: horrible and repel lant as Chinese. Gods, whilst others as sume the ohalbe of different birds and animals. :In one ilistance, a magnificent: rock, about ten feet'high, exactly resembles a petrilied Kangaroo,-whilst another is the verisimilitude of a gigantic squattiig duck; indeed, a asmall oological' dollection in stone could be made here.. Strange hollows and bore holes are worn in the solid rock, some of them saucer shaped, and others perfectly round and apparently bottomless. TIhese are filled with the crystal water, and teem with small fish. It would be a paradise for the eel, but these serpent like fish are not found in any river north of the Dividing Range. After running over the vast table rock where the natural museum of curiosities is placed, the bright water falls over a ledge of rocks a distance of about fifteen feet, sparkling like diamonds, into a still pool below, which numerous wild fowls make their haunts as abundant food is found, and the solemn quietness of the not makes it still more acceptable. iThe banks are lined with the wild rasp err over which the wattle tree bends, rid to. wering above all, those grand old Titans f the forest-the eucalypti throw o 4t their protecting arms, the vhole furmni u a picture of river beauty seldon equall od and never excelled. The first ten miles of the Campampe is a succession of scenes like this, after which a remarkabi " change for the worse takes place when it runs through settle ment, and it becon'es a prosaic and muddy beaten course. ].

Ituoman life has niany siniles. i Rennio had cosle difliculty in pursuadf. ing himself to settle down in the wild and lonely paradise he had seledied'fdir his homle. Used to chkerfulnomi;ny, rndirought ,up in acity, it required no slight wrench to -former :habits to bury himself iii liis` hermit like retreat. He was a compirative novice to busli life; but when he finally determined to become a free selector on the Campaspe, ho,worttainto the work with vigor. Employing. a. few experienced bush men, theysopun cleared a few acres and built a substaritial log house, atter which they fended'- iii the ground, and Earnest' Ronnie had` fairly joined/the urmty of amnil settlers-vho woro fast oveorrunuilng the colony lie had seven hundred pounds and ex pectations from:Home; so that he was in an imnmeasurably better position .than most other selectors, who took up land withli carcel enough ,capital to :pay the survey foes,.-and who for ?'ears after toiled like galley slaves in abject poverty ini what .was frequomtly.a.vain attempt.to. obtain tile fee simple of the ground. Men like Rennie wh3 had capital ulti. mately bought out such struggling people, and increased their original small hold ings to dimensions which were ample to combino grazing with agricultural pur suits. ' 1Within twelvo months. of Rennie's settlement at the head of the Campaspe, nearly the whole of 'the land along the river had beeoo pbgged.out and npplied for by various people, so that, the pioneer soon had neighbonrs ilho frequently broke in upon the privacy of his wild retreat. 

 CHAPTER XI., RENNlE'S, sOeRt. '\\ It was a rough jbourney through z wild country which Miss Devereaurx ,had'to travel in order to-resaiclshRniieda' neis home. 'The sound of crashing' trees falling befo6r the woodmain's 'axe broke upon the ear, and in evoryf dLirction theq, remains of stately eucalypti, with a small portion only, of the trunk'taken away for use, were lying around. The waste of fine timber wss'almost be yond conception, and-it induced a bitter Nemesis soon'after; for the vast quantity of fallen. timber, when it' becamo',dry, took fire, and swept away many homes and the fruits.of much labor....-.....---.

" We can make you quite comfortable herp, I assure you," he urged, -"and you will find a few days' change in the bush quite a relief from the bustle and worry of city life. Besides, you must -be tired out. She was riot anxious to leave, and was easily persuaded to remaini. Mrs. Aflleck .was a good, motherly woman, and Adeline was soon quite at home with her. Afterchanging her dress and partaking of a plain but wholesome meal, Miss Devereaux accepted Ronnie's invitation to view the clearing operations. Backed up with the needful money, the young selector had certainly worked wonders in tile primeval forest, and was rapidly making a comfortrable home. As they walked around, the thought which was uppermost in their minds found vent. '" y dear friend," Ronnie said, turn ing to the young girl, and speaking in a low voice, " I know you have come to this colony in search of your promised husband, and my beoat friend, Charles Edgar.

CHAPTER XII. TEn SUN' wnIL RISE AuAIL TO-DIORtaOW. SThie days passed swiftly to M.iss Devereaux in the new life stioe led in the wild" Blitbk Forest on.Renonie's selec tioen. The visitof a.day had lehgthened into aweekirand still she arwas luth to go, and hher ybrtinj .h6st was inost importunate in his 'requests for-her to'rematn... " If you will do mrue the favor t stayfric niiother week I will go to Melbourne with lyoui,"-he said.

He gave thie girl an evasive answer as to what thie clue was, for if there was ally truth in thie storyhe heard it pointed to fact that Charles Edgar must-have been murdered. It was only a tap-room yarn. In talk ing with one of his original employes about the affair which had created such Ait sensation, the old fellow, nwho was fuond of hIis grog when near a shanty, recollected that about the time it happened, a weary looking, restless iman cantle into thie bar of the Hanginrrg Rock hotel, near Woodend, and indulged very freely in whisky. It was niot long before he got drunk, and be gun to behave like a madman. The land lord tried to quietonr him, but his ap proaches were mot in thie most bellicose manner. After a time the drunken fellow sud denly calmed down, and going towards the peacemraker, looked fixedly at himi for a few moments, and then slowvly sa:id, with a strangely wild glitter in Iris eyes : : Look hero, you scoundrel.
