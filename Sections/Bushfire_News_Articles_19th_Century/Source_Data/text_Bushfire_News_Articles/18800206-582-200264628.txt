He expressed his strongest conviction that should the Houso of Lords be re-formed upon the colonial model, and an elective basis substituted for tho hereditary and nominee sys tem at present in force, those replacing the Peers would still assuino tho functions of the House of Lords as now existing, and, fortified by their elective basis, would exhibit an energetic desire to repress those whom they would consider their inferiors in the lowor chamber. This would bring about a stale of affairs which would soon produce a legislative deadlock, and an embit tered feeling. Any desperato remedy of that kind should bo adopted only in tho moat serious emergency.— -It lias been stated that early dur-. nig the ensuing session of Parliament the Go vernment propose to introduce a measure deal ing 111 a comprehensive and liberal spirit with the land question in Ireland.
