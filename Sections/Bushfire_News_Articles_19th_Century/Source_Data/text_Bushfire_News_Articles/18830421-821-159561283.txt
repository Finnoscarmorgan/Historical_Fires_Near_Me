BOARDS OF MAIN ROADS. CENTRAL DISTRICT. Monthly Meeting—Thursday, April 10. Fiesent — Messrs. K. bimtn (Chairman), \V_ Haines, M.P., J. H. Bagster, M.P., T. Hack, J.P., :uid S. Paltridge, J.P., Commissioners; Messrs. C. T. Margrave, C.E., and J. Morris, C.K., Surveyors ; and Mr. E. S. Davys, Secretary. Mr. Gni'TZ, Chairman of the North Rhine Dis trict Council, waited upon the Board as a deputa tion, to ask that the road from Keynton to Sedan should be repaired, as there were about 25 chains on the top of the hill which was in a very bad state. Be also suggested to the Board that a stationman should be placed on the road in question, as by doing so hundreds of pounds would be saved every year. Mr. MORB1S (Surveyor) intimated that there was a small sum available for the road, and the Chairman said the Surveyor would see to the matter and the work done as far as funds permitted, and if it was found necessary to place a stationman there it wonld he done. A deputation, consisting of the Mayor and Coun cillors of Glenelg, waited upon the Board, aud asked that the road from the Adelaide-road might be continued right through to Osmond-terrace at the same width as the latter, which was G6 feet. Mr. T. King, M.P. (Mayor of Glenelg) pointed out that at one part of the road, called Hector-terrace, it was only 30 feet wide, and it was desired that this portion should be widened to 00 feet. Tho traffic was very great, and was likely to increase. The Ch Ainu AN* said it was the intention of the Board when they had built the bridge to widen the road, but al though the other owners were agreeable, Mr. G. C. Hawker objected strongly. Councillor Gell said a portion of Osmond-terrace bad a very bad building level, and it could not be drained unless the Beard gave tbem power to alter the water-table. The more important matter was the widening of the road, and the Glenelg Corporation asked that the Board would simply exercise its rights and take the neces sary land compulsorily under the Act. The road being narrow at one part was detri mental to traffic and there was great difficulty in getting from the southern parts of the Hills dis tricts to the Grange and Henley Beach, and also Port Adelaide, and granting of the request would give these places facilities which did not now exist, and would shorten the road to the Port by two miles. Besides these places it was a main thorough fare to other rising townships. The whole of the land required was vacant, with the exception of a cottage, which was untenantable. The matter was of such importance that the Corporation thought the Board would be justified in taking the laud be longing to Mr. Hawker. Councillor LEE asked could not the Board induce tlie Government to Eurchase the land; their recommendation would ave great weight. There was a large settlement gatheringintheneighbourhood,aud the roadougUtto be widened to one chain. Other owners were willing to sell their land, and Mr. Hawker ought not be allowed to stand against the public interest. The Chairman said the Board quite agreed with the necessity of widening the road, but at present they bad no funds. Besides, the Board had laid down as a rule that they had no power to make any recommendation as requested to the Parliament; it was for the deputation to go to the Govern ment and ask for a new road, and, of couise, it it was referred to the Board, they would then recommend it. Councillor Lkk said they deserved special consideration from the Board, as they had kept Osmond-terrace in repair for years. Mr. Hack remarked that if the deputa tion placed the matter before Parliament, they might while they were about it endeavour to get the other end similarly dealt with. Mr. King assented and would like to know the probable cost of making the road right through. Mr. Hack said they would probably get a special vote for widening the road but not for making it. Mr. King remarked that the Board did not study who was the owner of the land; if it was wanted they took it. Mr. Paltridge said the Board was confined to a certain sum of money, and therefore they never forced a. road; but if the Government esked them to take such a coarse they bad no objection to do so. Mr. Kino—We will take the Board's advice and wait upon the Government, and depend upon the Board for assistance. The deputation then withdrew. THIRD CHEEK BRIDGE. The Chairman of the Stepney District Council, naited upon the Board, and asked that the bridge over the Third Creek might be further widened, Ah present the bridge was being widened to the extent of eight feet on the northern side, but if left at that it would be dangerous to pedestrians, as the tramcars running there would throw pedestrians into the road. He asked that the Board would assist in widening the bridge another 11 feet. The Chairman said the Board would kavo a look at the bridge before next meeting, and then the request would be considered. DEVIATION OK A ROAD. Mr. S. Tomhinson, M.F., introduced a Urge deputation, who asked that a deviation should he made in the road near Ingle wood for the purpose of making it safer for traffic, and requesting the Board to help them in memorislizing the Government. The Chaiiiiiaiv said the Board could not recommend any new roads to be placed on the schedule. The proper course was to go to the Government first, and then, if asked, the BoaTd would recommend the road. Mr. Haines thought the Board might go anil see the road. They had already recommended a portion of it, within chains of that now asked for, to he placed on the schedule. Mr. Cornish (a member 01 the deputation) said the people considered that the Black Dill-road.should be abandoned. The present roads were not desir able, but between the two there could be obtained a splendid road. Mr. Tomkinson believed that it was a deviation that had been approved of by the Board. Mr. Morris (Surveyor) said it was a new piece of road between Hougbton Hollow and Houghton township, and it could be dealt witli whenthenew Bond Bill was passed. The Chair man still thought the proper course was to go first to the Government. It was decided to adopt the suggestion of the Board. The deputation then asked that the corner of the footpath at the junction of the Keynton Valley-road and the Main Eastem-road in the township of Gumeracha should be rounded off. The request was granted, the cost not to exceed £10.
