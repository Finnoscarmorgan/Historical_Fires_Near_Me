J? or years the cry has been, 'Eeduoe.the.civilBervioe,' but evory formor Government has hesitated to undertake the unpleasant duty of cutting down salaries or dispensing with the services of public officers.

Thd Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have offered to lay down a duplicate cable, from Singapore to Port Darwin, undertaking at the same time to duplicate the lino direct fron Banjoewangie to Singapore and thence to Penang, for an annual subsidy. The advantage offered by this routo is that the cable would be doublo from Port Darwin to London. A proposal is to bo submitted to the Now South Wales Government for a oable from North-west Cape, Western Australia, via Banjoewangie to Singapore, and if approved of the other Australian colonies will be asked' to participate in the cost of con struction. A modification of this soheme has been mooted, namely, a cable from the same starting point direct to Anjer, which place already possesses telegraphic communi-5 bation with Singapore.- Two other, cable .routeabave been hinted at, namely, from Vib tqrifi't'd Western Australia, thence to Ceylon . via,. .Keeling. Island, arid- a coble 'from North west' Cape; Western., Australia, also to Ceylon, 'the- former, to boat £50,000 and the latter £55,000 per aununi. A' prevailing impression exists that:tho best cbinmunioation with Europe_is;t7#« Mauritius; the Cape of Good Hone and the Cane do Verd Islands, and that -sooner' or later this route ?muBt-1 be adopted. '?':' Its length would exceed only by Jtwq,.qr.tb..ree; hundrod miles that of the longest existing cable .line, and it presents no extraordinary difficulties of construction.

During the week ending the 12th inat. the heat was intense, arid news was received in town that extensive bush-fires were raging in 'some of the country districts. - About Colao the south and east of the district was enveloped in flames and smoke. Hundreds of acres of forest and miles of fencing were burned, and- tho fiauiea at one time threat- - ened to devastate the outlying portion of the township. The forest between Geelong and ?Cblao and the Otway Ranges suffered .' severely. There have been bush.flres in the Bullarook forest, in the Ballarat district, and the country along the ranges between Dayles- . ford and Gordon was. in flames ; much fenc- , ; ing arid a few crops have been consumed. \ The eighth and ninth days of the month '?? resembled the memorable Black Thursday of 1851\. . . ' Several -interesting experiments with the telephone have been made. The first waa made at the Melbourne University with an , instrument manufactured by Mr. Josephs, of Josephs Brothers, of Swanston-street, lieutenant in the Victorian Torpedo Corps. The experiments were conducted by Mr. Ellery,' the Government astronomer, and the -results '.were satisfactory. The second was' made with instruments constructed by Mr. J.'

The instruments were fixed ; about three-quarters of a mile apart, arid a conversation was carried^ ' bu „ r- , by the persons at either end with ease, while .

The dividends declared during the twelve months show n decrease of £275,000 as compared \- with those of the year 1870. Ab a set-oil however against this loss may be mentioned the fact that the inorcased yield, of our wheat fields has resulted in the export of some 100, 000 tonB of breadstuff's, representing n money value of £120,000 ; and if to this the value of the wheat and flour imported in 1876 be added, it will bring up the-total to about ? £215,000. The sales of stock that have taken plaoe during the month have been important, and the prices realised aro encouraging to owners and breeders. Mr. C. B. Fisher's celebrated MaribyrnongbtudjWhichhnsexisted for seven teen years, has been brought to the hammer. The sale was attended by all the prominent breeders and sporting men of Australia, and the bidding was most spirited. All the animals were sold without reserve, except Robinson Crusoe, who was passed in at 3000 guineas. It is understood that the horse is destined for England. The highest prices obtained were — Silvia, the dam of 'Goldabrough, 2650 guineas; Hose of Denmark, 2050 guineas ; Chrysolite, another marej 1750 guineas ; Fireworks, 1700 guineas, more than double the sum paid for the imported horse Marquis ; Dngmar, 1400 guineas ; Gem, 1350 guineas ; Lamornie, 1050 guineas ; Ragpicker and Sunrise, each' 1000 guineas; The grand total of the sale, comprising 100 lots of brood mares, year lings, two, and three year olds! horses in training and stallions, amounted to 47,055 guineas, the largest result ever obtained, from' the sale of blood stook ' in the Austraf lian colonies.

The total? amount realised for four pedigreed bulls, seven pedigreed heifers,' . sixty -seven herd bulls, and 100 pure-bred cows, was £10,710. There has been scarcely any. musical per formance deserving ospeoial note. A fare well concert was given by Mrs. Cutter and Mr. F. L. King prior to their departure on a professional tour in the other colonies. Mrs. . Gutter Bang the Legend of the Crossbill, by Longfellow, the musibof which was composed for her by Signor Zelman, and several other favorite airs, with complete success. Mr. King, who is a rising young pianist, per: formed two solos in a manner that spoke volumes for his execution and feeling. Seve ral other well-known, artistes took part in the performance. For some time paBt there have, been two organ recitals a week iii the Town Hall, Mr. David Lee, the city organist,, being the performer. He is master of the instru ment);;', and the selections he plays are vaVied,- and calculated to develop a popular taste for high-olass music. The attendances at these recitals are such as to show that they are appreciated. At the Theatre Royal the bur lesque of the Forty Thieves still oontinues on thfe' boards.

In the firBtportion he cleverly depicts the combined hilarity, stolid, calmness . and humoristid shrewdness of Stofel, but in the second part, when sup posed' to be affected with madness, there was a want of true pathos about his i deolamation, and natural ease in his aoting. - Mr. Farron made up well as Lizzie Stofel, and, allow ing for the difficulty a male has to contend against when assuming female characters, he acquitted himself creditably. The songs and dances introduced moot with the. ap proval of the audiences. Messrs. Bailey and Cooper have once more pitched their cirous tent in Melbourne. . They have so large a company that a double performance takes place at one and the same ' time. The feats of horsemanship are carried out with skill, and the tumbling is startling, one of the members turning a double somer sault over three large elephants and four camels with apparent ease. The trapeze performances are dangerous enough to satisfy the lovers of sensation acts, and the feats of strength performed by the 'lady with the iron jaw' are startling. Skilful Japanese juggling and, the troupe of educated dogs are by 'no means tne least . attractive por tion ~ of the entertainment. At. St. Geolrge's'Hali,.Capt. Hay ward's Combination Variety Troupe have nlade their reappear ance. Mr. Larooho has again made hirnself a favorite in his character songs. The other members of the co*mpany contributelrish8obg8t' clog dances, speoimens of sable minstrelsy and' fun, ballads and music hall selections, with varied degrees of skill and success. Mr. Stephen Massott, better known as jeames Pipe'sj of Pipesville, has paid another visit to Melbourne, and intends shortly giving, a series of the same entertainments that have gained him some' celebrity -in!. Europe and America. . ..... \- The University lists for tne!.1 examinations of the '. October term, 1877, speak well for the advance that Young Australia is making in the royal road to learning. In 1876 340 candidates offered themselves for the matriculation examination, of whom 153 passed and :foiir with credit. .'This year the numbor was 477, : of whom 178 passed— six with credit/ . In 1876: the number that went up for the , Civil Service examination was 409, and the numbor that .passed was 264\. In 1877 -? the candidates for exa mination numbered 585, but only 256: passed. While the number going up for ex animation- last year was greater than 1876, the total of successful candidates was less. This falling off may be accounted for by the faot that the ' praiseworthy desire to pass this examination ia so strong within the breasts of the Victorian youth that they often go up before they are. fully prepared, and in direct opposition to the wishes of their teachers. In the pre sent examination the lady candidates have achieved a success that does credit to their intellect and perseverance — 31 passed the matriculation examination as against 20 last year, and 40 have been suc cessful in passing the Civil 'Service exa mination against 38 in 1876. Out of the 111 lady candidates who went up this year. 71 have passed the ordeal triumphantly. Numerically these inorcases are not large, but if our limited population be taken into account, together with the fact that this general desire for higher education is of but recent growth, the result augurs well for the future intellectual development of the race.

Tho- Government of Western Australia has, we understand, made proposals to the Governments of Victoria 'and South Aus tralia for the establishment of a line of steamers between the Australian colonies and India. According to the sbheme at E resent suggested a lino of steamers is to run etween Singapore and Melbourne, calling, at Adelaide and one of the principal ports of Western Australia. It is thought that the establishment of such a line as that which the Australian Government contemplate may prove advantageous to the trade of the colonies generally.
