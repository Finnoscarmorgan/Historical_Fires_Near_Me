-QBWiT BUSH FIRES 'IN' VICTORIA: ,y/ '--'I '? ? .^ToouirwAii, Sunday Night. In' this part of the Biverina disastrous buahfires make their appearance annually as. regularly as Christmas. u, :v-ln,1884 a serious fire played sad havoc ,y ^amongj' the settlers. It commenced on the 6th January, and every year Bince then a fire has broken out within *2 m^es °* tne township, and ey.ery.y.ear it has been worse. Last year the fire was at, its worst, when, providentially, -a' heavy.: showed of ram tell, fnd'it was' extinguished as suddenly as;it rr began. .This year, 'on the 6th January, at a 10' a.m., the epidemic again made its appeaj1 , ,.ance. On this occasion it is .the worst ever ^f.sb'eri by white men in this district, and. it is ''' ' r ©till raging at its east and west extremities, 1 'tho'ugh at the latter end there is every ''^probability of its soon being got under. The °-' townspeople and settlers for miles around ^'tiiiye be&n; \porkiug to help their neighbours ?* ','°tp,sav'e. their .'property, , and, they are now (; .nearly all knocked up with fatigue and heat, .^'itlie/weath.er is exceedingly hot. Yesterday ' 'irtiw'as \0q degrees in the true shade, and to '^^iayrii; was 110— a regular., ' roaster.' In '^'the bush near the smouldering timber thq, c heat was overpowering, and must have been . considerably oyerr 150 degrees. ; u0- Mr.1 Cameron has a holding of 1,280 acres, half of which he selected, and half of which ., his wife did the same with previous to their ''m'arriag'e, and then becoming man and wife, ~? 'their Wate became one. It appeared that ? ' Cameron, had a oO-acre paddock on. which a '' fine crtfp ,of wheatr had been standing, ready ' .'r',fttf. be.' '.stripped. : On Thursday, last at [ .^16 b?cl6bk a.m., they.got.down to the paddock B Jjfcq'cbmmeiice'opertitionsr, The entrance is at 'r'ihV north-east corner. The eastern fence is chock and log, and the 'northern was a bush fence. Two men with a team of horses entered the paddock wiih a winnowing machine. About five mmutes afterwards came/twb men with a pair 6i- horses attaohed to the r stripper. _ Just as they got through the gate /isolthe maii states,1; the horses tramped, on some wax matches, and before they knew J. wheie they' were the. grass - was all ablaze. v It took them all their time to get the horses . xi sately out of the paddock, and to place -the machinery .beyond the; reach of -the fire. By this time the fire had got a strong hold ^ o£ the grassland the bush fence, . and as the ^ wind was blowing from the north-east,! the i, : fire made straight. for the grain. '? Cameron's \- house was a quarter of 'a mile away, and —Cameron -and Mr. Atkinson his easterly neighbour,! who was, also waiting for the stripper, had gone to the dam to get a barrel of water* Suddenly they saw smoke, Cameroii', ^dropping the bucket, exclaimed ' 'Gfreafneayens, the grain is on fire !' ancl off - they, set to the scene of the outbreak. jAil; along the north of the Barooga boundary selectors had paddocks of beautiful j grassland rich crops of wheat, many of them .averaging fully 20 bushels to the acre. .' : j j,j [Amongst the selectors a panic set in, and it was; some time before they could realise I their position. The ploughs were. got out; x and, the land several furrows deep inside the j iences .(turned over. People came nocking ^Irom, all; directions, and though here and tEere-a few square.yards. of grass was burnt; the fire was kept from spreading in theit direction. This was ; extremely fortunate] '?fbrl-h'ad- it been | otherwise ; the loss and suffering would have been terrible, as once the fire got northwards scores of settl6rs i, would have; been ruined. !? The fire made a clean sweep of Barooga station, burning it out from boundary to boundary, and out ( of ^,bput;j8Q,0.00, acres, of good grazing land 7o$60 acres nave been laid bare. It4 was ^pnly^jby^superhuman efforts that the men on the run, assisted by dozens of willing workers . from Tpcum.wai, saved, the woolshed and men'g hats ; in fact, their escape, was almost a miracle.' The fell destroyer had actually ^urnedgthe, grass right up to the walls, of the *1)Uirdings ^and scorched, the foundations.! Many^of *|Ka men .were severely, scorched. The^stefftpg was saved. It is not yet known how^marty' sheep have been burned, but it is .thought that the loss in this direction,, will tbtflight.. . :; ; i ,'Cme,,p.f 'the fifsjb, to fee! the^effepts ..'pf the) ^^agratiph^ w.a's ;.Mr. ; Etjward ; HiiMb'n; ^s^wr'pkeipp'er and, farmer. ;/ Mr. ffillspn is the j9'^n,er ,pf- tJhe only large store in Tocumwal, I $n&'? i^.a^ap jibe prop j ietpr of .about 8,000 acres * of land about haifr a-mile from .the township .

This paddock .contained 200 acres of wheat straw, and ad joins the Albury road. . ;v Messrs. W. and, E. Hennessy, of the firm of Hennessy Brothers, who own Glautworth ^ud Springfield estates, and who haye been 'ctivwly engaged looking' after the fii;e and eiuleavouriug to- keep it oft' their property, Btated : — About 10 o'clock, when at Spring field, where we reside, we saw the smoke of - ? a large bush tire about six miles north-east ?of Tocumwal. We made all haste in that direction; but when we: met the fire, it had reached the west side of the rock. It was coming down south-eastwards at a ra're rate. It passed through the Murray run, and de stroyed neirly the wholo of it. This used all to belong to M'Farland Brothers, but a great ; portion of it has been selected. One of the selectors, Joseph Howard, has been burnt olean'out, only his house being saved. The fire reached the Jerilderie road on Thurs day night or Friday morning, but up .to Friday night, siuce when wo have not been far along the road, it had not passed it. Last year the young Browns, selectors near the Murray, about ten miles up the Jeril- . derie road, along with .others, organised a ? fire-brigade. These men have been, with others, going up and down the road, and * beating out. any sparks that might have been blown across into the west paddook. Up to Friday night -they succeeded in doing this, '^L but* since then' the fire has worked round northwards, and is blazing for miles to the west. We have .succeeded in keeping Glent tworth, which lies to the east of Mr. Sugden's, and between the Albury road and the River Murray, free from thy fire. This station is now safe for the present, but there is a small corner of Mr, Sugden's next to the river un burnt, which may yet blaze up. So men are stationed to watch it. A. P. H. and I. Association. — There was only a bare quorum at thev committee meetimg convened for Wednesday night — namely Messrs. Primrose (president), J. and B. Barnes, Matthews, witK the secretary (Mr. OonneH). A few acoounts were passed, and the meeting was adjourned till Tuesday night next. ( Death of the Hon. J. N. Eyan, ML.C. ; — -At a quarter to three o'clock on Thursday morning we (Echo) received a telegram from Mr. F.J. Rae, the stationmasteratBinaloner, stating that the Hon. John Nagle Eyan, M. L. C., died on his way to-Syclney bnjJVednes day night in his buggy, before he reached the. Galong platform. Mr. Ryan was a large .landed proprietor in the Burrowa district, and was conspicuous for his genial hospi tality. He was appointed a member of the Legislative Council on the 18th September, 1883, but he never took a very active part iu ? politics. Further particulars state that he . *- died between 8 and 9 o'clock, while on the way from Q-along to Galong platform, whither he was going on the way to S}rdney for medical advice ; that he had been ailing for some time, but seemed better, when hie determined to go to Sydney. Mias Auastasia Ryan, his niece, 'was driving, but did not observe anything the matter until deceased's head dropped on his breast, and on pulling it up it was found that life was nealy gone, .and death occurred about a minute after \wards. ?:' Tumut Crops.— Iq acknowledging a letter from our editor, a correspondent at Tumut gives the following interesting note on*:the crops of that district and 'Explains how the tobacco crop is grown : — 'Large quantities of tobacco are on the road to market, and, as far as I can j udge, the producers are doing well ; the growing of the narcotic - weed is, I may say, entirely in the hands of the almond eyed, your white man not being possessed of the patience absolutely necessary to the luccessful production of this well paying but delicate crop, for Messrs. Chi.ng, Ghongj Oh, My, and Co., water each plant morning and evening ; mthe morning1 covering each plant with a bunch of straw, to keep off the fierce rays of the sun, and in the evening remov ing this covering. When the plant assumes larger proportions you will see the celestial ..-» squatted on hie hams wiping and cleaning each separate leaf of ? each plant. ' This is not on a small patch of groundj but acres upon acres. The colonial farmers plant it out and leave it to struggle on as best it can ; sure consequence, failure— for, if not scorched ^t up, .caterpillars, which are. extremely fond of J^ it, go. in for chews, like thorough' down-east :F^i Yankees.' Our Hollow Sham.— An intelligent cor respondent who has always kept' a vigilant '\ eye upon the representativet)f the electorate thus writes to the editor :?--' The Buttetiri has a column giving that nincompoop Want a- dressing down, arid you will find that they only reiterate -what I stated, at the time he was elected, and I was not far wrong when I called his Ministry a rotten- Ministry^ y His advocate in Gootamuhdra said, 'You -v don't know, what he is until he Has had a -trial.' What would yousay to a builder using rotten . stiifii to build a house'with?. Should you say, :' Man, thathouse will never stand, .-, the~T 'foundation and materials: are rotten,' and he 'were; to replyj ? We don't know luritil ? we give them a trial,'— would1 you not say ^ 'that^inBn^wasan -idiot-?i;: L-Uppn- my.'snulf ana heartily sick of people who, claiming to ~~T possess intelligence arid brains/ can give their support to such out-arid-out— hollow shams as Want.' ' ?? Smart Farming.— A correspondent writes: % — «? The sons of Mr. A.Qr, Keith are hard at || work on their Mimosa farm, the crops on vl which this year average' 30 bushels to the ;®l acre. The biggest day's work so far has }???% been 51 bags ; and others havft averaged ^5 f\\* bags a day for 17 days, including 'drawing Jsp in, stacking in the shed, with one man j|f| strinmM|gM^o|f-amng, &o.; The 'Martin- i^fi ???? ? ^f ^pent.— -Like the brazen Vf -f ?.^-?^*\wishL|^rLlifted 0M.
