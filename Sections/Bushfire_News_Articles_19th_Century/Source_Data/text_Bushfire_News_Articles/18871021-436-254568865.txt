BALLANDRY. (FBOM OUB OWN COEEESPONDENT.) Considerable dissatisfaction is expressed with regard to the Government tank here, and as the subject is one of vital importance to stockowners, ic is to be hoped something may be done at once. In its present condition the tank will not contain the amount of. water needed. More than: this, no provision is made for prompt emptying, aud this omission is fraught with great danger to teamsters hnd owners of stock in the neighborhood: of these tanks, in the event of diseased travelling stock watering thereat. Thetroughing ought to 'bfe immediately emptied and cleansed before any other stock are allowed to water, and the attention of the authorities should be called to the matter. Ballandry will cuc out to-morrow. Everything has gone on at this shed with the regularity of clockwork, and with half the number of weekly men that have been employed in former years. Thisjsays a good deal for the new manager. -1 think owners and managers of stations 'ought to take time by the forelock, and make .some provision for the prevention of bush-fires, as there is no excuse- now,that shearing is finished at most of the sheds. If owners were to muster their sheep and drive them round their boundaries, thereby trampling the grass down, it would do good. Sheep are in good condition at the present time on all the stations, and thitwould not hurt them. I would remark that if a fire once break out, with the accumulation of fallen scrub and the dense growth of the grass it would be impossible to stop it until it had buret itself out. A rumour prevails about here that there is going to be a change in the Cabinet. Some seem to think that it is indecent for Sir Henry to hold the reins under the circumstances. I heard one gentleman say the other day that if Sir Henry were to die, the business of the country would go on all the same j and after bis vindictive prosecution of Mr. Webb, of the Campbelltown Times, there is no pity for him.
