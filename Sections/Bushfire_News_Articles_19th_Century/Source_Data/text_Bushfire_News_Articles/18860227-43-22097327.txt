The Bush Fires Relief Movement. MEETING OF THE DELEGATES. The first meeting of delegates appointed to supervise the distribution of the amount collected on behalf of the sufferers by the recent fires in the forest country, was held on Wednesday afternoon at the Shire Hall, Manifold street. The follow- ing delegates were present :— The Hon. J. Williamson, M.L.C. (who appeared on behalf of the Mayor of Melbourne) representing the Melbourne committee. Messrs. J. Walls and F. Rae — Camper- down. Mr. Glasgow, president of the Shire of Warrnambool; Mr. Simpson, Mayor of the Town of Warrnambool; Mr. Midgley, Mayor of Koroit; and Mr. G. F. Barber, president of the Agricultural Society of Villiers and Heytesbury-Warrnambool and Koroit districts. Mr. Collins, president of the Shire of Colac, and Mr. A. A. D. Dyke — Colac. Mr. D. S. Walker, President of the Shire of Hampden, Mr. A. J. Black, and Mr. J. C. Duigan — Terang. Mr. Vickers and Mr. Drayton — Pan- mure. Mr. Craig — Scott's Creek. Mr. Widdicombe — Port Campbell. Mr. F. J. Clarke — Cobden. On the motion of Mr. D. S. Walker, seconded by Mr. J. Walls, the Hon. J. Williamson was voted to the chair. The chairman briefly returned thanks for the honor conferred upon him, and regretted the absence of the Mayor of Melbourne, who was not able to attend. There was no doubt that Mr. Stewart's experience would have been of great ser- vice to them, but on looking round and seeing the delegates, he thought the chairman's duty would be very light that day. The one object of those assembled together was to do justice to those people whose losses they had met to consider. They would, without doubt, all do their best to arrive at a just conclusion. Mr. Vickers, Panmure, said he had one word to say before proceeding with business, and that was with regard to the constitution of the committee of delegates. The question was on what basis were they to act. He considered that each com- mittee should be on an equal basis and he noticed that some committees had ap- pointed three delegates and others two. There were two delegates each for Camper- down, Colac & Panmure, and three for Terang, whilst other committees were represented, by one delegate. He was prepared to move to the effect that whilst all present be allowed to participate in the discussions, one delegate only from each committee be allowed a vote. Mr. Rae, Camperdown, pointed out that in only one case had three delegates been appointed. In this instance the extra appointment was made in the event of one not being able to attend. Mr. Walker, Terang, corroborated the statement. The Terang committee had appointed a third delegate as a kind of emergency man, in case one or both of the others might not be able to put in an appearance. As matters were it was fortunate the provision had been made seeing that he had business which would prevent him from remaining at the meet- ing. Messrs. Duigan and Black, would represent, and vote on account of the Terang committee. He thought all the delegates should be allowed to express their views on the business that came be- fore them. Mr. Widdicombe, Port Campbell, con- sidered it was advisable to get all the opinions possible. He thought that the more delegates present the better it would be. (Hear hear.) The only reason there were not more, was that the ex- penses would be increased. Mr. Barber, Warrnambool, pointed out that perhaps one district had collected more money than another, and he thought if they went into the question at all, they would find it a very difficult one to con- sider. He deemed it advisable to proceed as at present. This suggestion was embodied in a resolution, which was moved by Mr. Barber, seconded by Mr. Rae and carried. The chairman said he had expected a letter from the Mayor of Melbourne giving particulars of the monies collected in Melbourne in aid of the fund, but it had not come to hand. He had tele- graphed on the subject, but as yet had received no reply. Mr. Rae was appointed to act as secre- tary pro tem, and read the correspondence received. This comprised a letter from the hon. secretary of the Ballarat com- mittee to the effect that they were not sending a delegate, but would agree with action taken at meeting, and forward sum received to the central fund when notified, of establishment of same. A telegram was received from Mortlake to a some- what similar effect. The Town Clerk of Melbourne telegraphed the inability of the Mayor of Melbourne to attend the meeting, and the appointment of Mr. Williamson as his substitute. A letter was read from the Colac committee naming delegates appointed and containing fol- lowing suggestion—"That the whole of the losses be enquired into by the central committee on one basis, and that the amount be allocated to each district in proportion to their wants and require- ments, and that the individual distribution is left to the local committees." The secretary of the Geelong committee wrote to the effect that no delegate was appointed, and that they would be able to remit a sum of £200. The chairman said with regard to the funds, would it not be best to gather them all into one central fund at Camper- down? It would be necessary to have one common fund. Mr. J. Walls, Camperdown, thought the first business to transact was to con- stitute themselves into a regular committee not only for the present, but for any con- tingencies that might arise in the future. It was advisable to appoint permanent offices. After the committee had agreed as to the mode of distribution the local committees could have control of the funds proportioned to them. He would move that the hon. J. C. Williamson be appointed permanent chairman, Mr. Heales, treasurer, and Mr. Rae, secretary, of this committee. There had been a little feeling manifested with regard to the committee styling itself the central committee. He might explain that this was done in view of Camper- down being about the centre of the district devastated by the fires, and the terminus of the railway. There was nothing but an earnest desire that the thing should be arranged in the most amicable manner. Mr. Widdicombe seconded the motion, and it was carried unanimously. Mr. Vickers asked whether it was necessary the money should be paid into one fund. The chairman thought it would be better if that plan were adopted. Mr. Barber suggested, with reference to the manner of distribution, that no money should be paid, but that letters of credit be given. Mr. Widdicombe thought that if the final distribution was left to the local committees their knowledge of the facts of each case would enable them to arrive at a decision as to what was best to be done. Mr. Simpson, Warrnambool, recom- mended they should find out the exact amount of money obtained. Mr. Rae said that as far as was known there was £5000 in round numbers already collected. It was moved by Mr. Rae, and seconded by Mr. Widdicombe—"That all monies collected on behalf of the sufferers by the recent disastrous bush fires be paid into one general fund at the Colonial Bank, Camperdown." Mr. Simpson thought there was hardly any need for that. Colac could be credited with the amounts collected there, and the division of the general fund could be forwarded there for final distribution, and so with the other places. Mr. Dyke, Colac, thought it would facilitate matters greatly if the monies were paid into one general fund. To do otherwise might lead to complications which might not otherwise arise. Mr. Vickers said that with regard to the question of the distribution of money after it had been paid into one fund, the allotments by this committee should be handed over to the local committees for final distribution. Mr. Midgley, Koroit, thought Mr. Walls idea on the subject was the best. Mr. Barber agreed with the proposal, as he considered there would be less con- fusion if the monies were all paid into one general fund. The motion was then put to the meeting and carried unanimously. Mr. Vickers proposed—"That after the monies had been paid into the general fund in Camperdown, and the basis of distribution arrived at, the amounts as proportioned be paid over to the local committees for them to deal with accord- ing to the distribution agreed upon." Mr. Drayton, Panmure, seconded the motion. Mr. Craig supported the motion, and thought no one would dispute the fact that the best plan was to leave the final distribution of the allotments made by this committee, to the local committees, who had most local knowledge. Mr. Barber spoke against the distribu- tion being left to the local committees. It was their duty to examine the printed lists of losses, as submitted to them, and inquire into the respective claims. He moved that, instead of paying money to the sufferers they be given letters of credit for the amounts to which, on inspection, they may be entitled to receive, to be paid upon production of the vouchers to the treasurer. Mr. Walls did not think the money should be handed over to the individuals but to the local committees. Mr. Black, Terang, thought the motion was being interpreted in different ways. He understood from the motion that this committee was to deal with each individual case. Then the total sum allotted to each district was to be handed over to the committee for that district. Mr. Drayton thought the motion was quite correct. He agreed with Mr. Black that the general committee should make the distribution, and then pay the amounts into the credit of the local committees for distribution. The chairman thought it would be an advantage for the local committees to have the distribution of the awards. Mr. Midgley, Koroit, questioned whether there might not be danger of favoritism if the monies were entrusted to the local committees. Mr. Walls felt the responsibility as much as anyone could do. He felt sure that whatever awards were made there was certain to be considerable dissatisfac- tion. He thought that only those who had the local knowledge should have the final distribution of the awards. The local committees had full information. It entailed upon them a large amount of thankless trouble, whilst it also was a pleasure for them to do what they had been doing. There were some business- men who had lost by the fire. His idea was that the people who had contributed to this fund did so for the purpose of putting the selectors on their land again. The idea that prevailed here was that the monies when portioned to the various local committees should be expended first of all in providing shelter for those whose houses had been burnt; then for the fen- cing, and paid over according to the extent of fencing erected. There might be monthly inspections of the work done, on which payments would be made. Mr. Walls thought that some who had lost houses might prefer to spend their allot- ments on other improvements such as fencing. Further discussion ensued, and as there seemed to be a misunderstanding on the subject, some appearing to think that it was intended to hand over the division of the money to the local committees, the motion was altered to read as follows, and carried unanimously:—" This committee, having arrived at the amount to be allotted to each local committee at Colac, Camper- down, and Panmure, resolves that the amounts be paid into the credit of these committees." Mr. Simpson thought the houses and effects should be regarded as the first claim on the fund; the balance to be divided over the losses. He moved to that effect, Mr. Vickers seconded the motion. Mr. Walls mentioned the cases of John Silk, £600, and Robert McGee, £920, which appeared on the Colac printed list. The Camperdown committee had ignored all claims put in by individuals not living by their selections. If applicants for a share in the distribution were not selectors they were struck off altogether. Mr. Craig thought they should deal in the first instance with the claims of those who had lost houses. Mr. Collins thought the motion a proper one, and mentioned the case of a man who had lost a house of the value 0f £500. Mr. Widdicombe thought that a man with a house worth £700 could scarcely be considered a recipient of charity. It was here explained, that the Camper- down and Colac lists were compiled from sworn declarations, verified to a great ex- tent by experienced valuers. Mr. Barber with regard to the principle of distributing the money said it struck him whether a man worth £1000 was entitled to charity. Taking as an example a man who stated he had lost £900 by the fire; that man might have £1000 more, and he could scarcely be considered a fit object for charity. Mr. Vickers thought the fund was for relief and not for replacing capital. Mr. Simpson suggested that the second claim on the fund could be stock and implements, and the third fencing. He excluded all machinery under the second head. This suggestion was included in his previous motion, which upon being put to the meeting in its altered form, was carried unanimously. Mr. Vickers said the fire was a positive benefit to many, on account of the clearing done. Mr. Widdicombe knew of a lot of old fencing which could not have been got rid of for a lot of money, having been entirely destroyed by the fire. Mr. Barber moved, and Mr. Simpson seconded —"That in case of any in- dividual demanding £700 from the fund for losses sustained, no money be allowed him." He thought that any man worth £700 was not entitled to charity from this fund. Mr. Widdicombe mentioned the case of one man, doing a good business, who had his name down on the list for £20. Mr. Drayton thought the local com- mittees knew who were entitled to participate in the fund better than anyone else. Mr. Midgley suggested that any matter of dispute be referred to the general committee. The motion was then carried. Mr. Simpson moved that the funds be allotted in the following proportion—6o per cent, to replace houses and effects ; 25 per cent, stock, implements, &c.; and 15 percent, fencing. Mr. Midgley seconded the motion. Mr. Widdicombe mentioned the case of one sworn declaration in which the value of a house destroyed was set down, at £100, whereas it was only worth £7. An opinion was expressed that an official check on fraud would be found in local committees. Mr. Simpson stated that according to the tabulated statements 23 houses had been burnt in the Heytesbury forest, 20 in the Otway forest, and three in the Panmure district. The motion was eventually carried. The consideration of the lists was the next business, and the following returns were laid on the table:— CAMPERDOWN LIST.

Mr. Rae moved and Mr. Dyke seconded —"That the whole of the sums collected be apportioned as follow: — 46 per cent to the Camperdown district, 46 per cent to Colac and 8 per cent to Panmure." The motion was carried unanimously. Mr. Barber moved to the effect that in- stead of passing money to the sufferers they be given letters of credit so that by the production of the necessary vouchers the various local committees may have a check on its expenditure. Mr. Simpson seconded the motion. Mr. Dyke thought the suggestion a very sensible one, but as the local committees were to deal with claims it would be well to leave the matter to them. Mr. Vickers said it would do if it were merely given as a suggestion to the local committees. Mr. Drayton agreed with the suggestion, but he thought it would be advisable to leave it with the local committees to see that the money was laid out on the land in some way or the other. It was agreed that the motion be taken as a suggestion to the local com- mittees. Mr. Walls, the treasurer and the sec- retary, were authorised to draw cheques on the general fund. Mr. Simpson moved and Mr. Barber seconded—"That advertisements be in- serted calling in all subscription lists as soon as possible."—Carried. Mr. Barber moved and Mr. Rae seconded —"That each local distributing com- mittee be requested to furnish the general committee with a detailed account of the distribution of the fund in order that a complete statement might be put before the public on the completion of the distribution."—Carried. Mr. Vickers mentioned the matter of the expenses of the local committees such as advertising &c.; It was mentioned that in the cases of the Camperdown Chronicle and the Warrnambool Standard, the proprietor, Mr. Opie, had generously offered to do the advertising free of charge. On this subject it was agreed that each local committee should defray its ex- penses out of the local contributions sending the net amount to the central committee. Mr. Rae moved and Mr. Ridgley seconded—"That the thanks of the meet- ing be tendered to the press of the colony for the able manner in which the claims of the fund had been advocated." The mover made special reference to the Warrnambool Standard, Argus, Camper- down Chronicle." The motion was carried. Mr. Walls referred at some length to the noble efforts put forth by the people of Warrnambool when the full particulars of the case were brought before them by the Standard. He also made reference to the exertions of their parliamentary repre- sentatives, making special mention of their chairman, Mr. Williamson. Mr. Craig fully endorsed the remarks of the previous speaker, and referred in kindly terms to the great assistance Mr. Walls himself always gave the forest people. He expressed his surprise and pleasure at the noble response made over the colony to the appeal for help. Mr. Midgley moved a vote of thanks to the chairman who had done his duty nobly and well. He had managed the meeting capably, and as a Melbourne citizen should do. The motion was carried with acclama- tion. The chairman returned thanks. He was very sorry the Mayor of Melbourne could not attend, as his presence would have been of great service. The Mayor was accustomed to take the chair. He could speak as to the sympathy in Mel- bourne for the forest people when the full extent of the disaster became known. He had promised to collect £50, and was not an hour in doing so, getting it all in the Australian Club. Shortly afterwards he gathered an additional £60. This was all obtained from squatters from the Far North and other individuals who were, perhaps, outside the reach of collectors generally. He never received a refusal from one individual he asked. He was glad to see they had arrived at a very satisfactory conclusion of what he had con- sidered was to be a very great difficulty. The chairman eulogistically referred to the efforts put forth by Mr. Fitzgibbon, town clerk, of Melbourne, on behalf of the fund. - A vote of thanks was passed to the secretary on the motion of Mr. Vickers seconded by Mr. Glasgow, and the pro- ceedings terminated.
