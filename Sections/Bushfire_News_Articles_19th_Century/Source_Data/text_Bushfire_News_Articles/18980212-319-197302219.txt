FERN TREE GULLY DESTROYED, THE PARK REDUCED TO ASHES FERN TREE GULLY". Wednesday The township of Upper Fern Tree Gully narrowly escaped destruction yesterday evening. The fires, which -had been burning here for two weeks past, had been confined to parts of the Daudenong btate Forest, but the strong gale suddenly carried them to wards Bayswater. On reaching IV. Murphy's,, on One Tree Hill, the blaze entered that lovely summer resort, the Fern Tree Gully Park, where thousands of visi tors go yearly, and the whole of this has been reduecd now to a mass of white ashes. From tlie park the fire reached the Scoresby Village Settlement, which it burnt to the gro.und. 'A public meeting is to be called to protest against the conduct of the trustee of the park, who when waited on and asked to tqke steps to have it protected, dismissed the deputation by informing the residents that the ferns there were too green to ren der its destruction possible.
