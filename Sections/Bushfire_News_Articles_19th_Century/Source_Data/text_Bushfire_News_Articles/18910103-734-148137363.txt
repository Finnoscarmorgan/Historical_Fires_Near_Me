Parker oauie to us at a certain part of that fire, and that I then pointed out to him the necessity of sub duing the fire that night, or otherwise when the wind veered round to the east ward the next morning, it would carry the fire with fearful rapidity through Grassdale to York. If Mr. Parker had acted a judicious part he would not have stopped to help us put the fire out, but would have galloped off to Grassdale and sent us up a supply of water for which we were famishing. At the time that Mr. Parker left us he knew that we, one and all, had to leave the fire to search for water in the gullies. A little after sundown Mr. Hamersley came to us with a bag of water, but it was then too late, for our little party had become dispirited and exhausted, for we had been at work from daylight until eight or nine o'clock at night. "We had nothing to eat from abont 7 o'clock in the morning. When Mr. Hamersley came to us our little party was reduced to three in number, and we were obliged tb " give in " through fatigue, although the fire at the time was nearly ex tinguished. In l he letter signed "Tom Tit," I said that I had no ill-feeling in making personal remarks, biit that I wished for people to have the fore thought not to put off until to morrow that which can be done to-day. If Mr. Parker and Mr. Hamersley had arrang ed to have sent but two men each to have released us that night the fire would have been extinguished, and Mr. Hamersley would ^ow have had his grass for his stock, and the Messrs. Par ker would have had the hay in rick which was consumed by the bush-fire. I may write again so that the public might glean some useful hints how to combat and subdue bush-fires, and per haps prevent some from being ignited, and detect those who wilfully and ma liciously set fire to them. I am, Sir, yours, etc., WILLIAM BURTON. Millbrook, Dec. 26, 1890.
