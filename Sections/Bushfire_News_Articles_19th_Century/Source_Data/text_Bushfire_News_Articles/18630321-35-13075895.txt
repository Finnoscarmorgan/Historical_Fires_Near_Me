ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN AND CHINA TELE- GRAPH. To the Editor of the Herald Sir,-I perceive from »iticks which hate appeared in some recent issues of your valuable journal that there ib strong ground for bi-lievmg that the great sjstem of Indian telegraphy will, b) the close of the present tear, be placed in connection with that of Europe, bj means of a line passing through Belgium, German), and Türke), b) the tallis of the ligris and Eu- phrates to Bagdad-to which it has elread) been completed-sncl thence by Bussorah and bt a sub- marine line through the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean to Ivunachee The Reel Sea hue, too, will undoubtfdl) be lenttved as conhdence is restored m (ho reliableness of submarine cables, and the modern improvements in the construction of theee cables indi cate that tbia will take place at no distant date lhere isa strong probability, therefore, that when these two lines are completed, no interruption of tele- graphic communication between Europe and India will again take place, or at least be of long con tit uance 1 he Indian telegraph has airead) been established as tar as Rangoon, and we are informed that measures are m progress for ita extension from thence to Singa- pore. The London Times of the 26th December last states that " before this time twelvemonth the wire will be laid, and London m point of time withm twelve hours distance, not only of Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, but of the furthest limits of the Eastern Indian frontier be) ond Rangoon ' For some time telegraphic communication existed between Singapore and Java, and although it has been temporaril) suspended another attempt is about to be made for its re establishment It is intended also to carry the line from Singapore via Labuan and Manila to Hongkong, so as to embrace China within this I vast bj stem of telegraphic communication I have I entered into these particulars in order to show, thnt I the time has arrived when the Australian colonies ought no longer to delay the adoption of such mea eures as mey be necessary to effect a connexion with the line at Java, or any nearer point in the Dutch settlements to which it may be brought I Bincerel) tru&t; that no local jealousies will be allotted to interfere with this great national object, but that all the Australier colonies will lend their cordial co-operation and assistance in carrying it out In order to arrit e at a sound conclusion on the suo ject, it mat not be uninteresting briefly to enumerat" the several propositions that have been made for con nectmg the present and projected telegraphic system of Australia with Jata, so as to effect the great object sought to be accomplished-the instantaneous communication, so to speak, of these colonies w ah India Europe, China, and America, when the several 1 rejects notv in progress and in contemplation shall have been, as I hate everv confidence the) will be, successfully earned out let To lay a submarine cable from Brisbane through Torres Straits and the Indian Ocean to Cape Sedaño at the east end of Jat s -The distance, t How ing for slack and repairs, is estimated hy Mr Gisborne to be 3492 miles, which at £315 a mile, for a cable of the requisite strength and durability, aceor ding to the unprotements suggested by the most recent experience, makes the co6t amount to £1,100,000 2nd Jlo construct a line overland from Brisbane bj the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria to Port E smgton, and thence by a submarine cable to Cspe Sedaño - I The length of the overland line is 1900 miles, the cost ofttlichat £120 a mile, including stations, would amount to £228,000-and from Pott Essington to Cafe Sedaño 1115 miles, which at £315 a mile would amount to £351,226-or, for the whole line, £579,225 3rd To construct an oterlana line from Adelaide via Coop r a Creek and Burke's track to the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria and Port Essington, and thence by submarine cable to Cape Sedaño -The dis- tances by this route, oterland and by sea, me about tfee same na from Brisbane tia Carpentaria and Port Essington to Cape Sedaño, and the coat therefore ttould probably be about the same-£679,225 4th To construct an overland line from Port Augusta to the head of Spencer's Gulf by Stuart a track lo Cambridge Gulf and thence by a submarine cable to Copang and Cape Sedaño -The distance overland is et-timated to be 1480 mile*, the cost ot which et £120 a mile, including stations, would amount to £177,600 The distance bv sea is about 1040 miles, the cost of which at £315 a mile would amount to £327,600,-making a total charge for this line of £505,200 The soundings between Cape Lon donderr), ar the hea i of Cambridge Gulf, and Copang, ai pear b) the Admiralty charts to be extrcmel) fat our- al le for lajing down a submarine cable, va they m nj case exceed sixlj f ithoms 5th To lo) a suhmarine cable from Adelaide round the coast to King George s Sound and Western Aus- tralia to the neighbourhood of Exmouth Bay, and thence to some point in Java -The dis ance Dy this route would, I believe, be about the same as from Brisbane vii Torres Straits , and as the whole line must be laid with a submarine cable, the cost w ould be about the same-with this disadt antage that one of the sections would have to be a deep sea line of 1100 miles in length It it obvious from the above that, b) adopting one or other of the overland routes, not onl) would the distance be tfry matenall) shoriened, but the cost of construction would be reduced to considerably le»B than a half I am not disposed to under estimate the difficulties that would have to be encountered in con s'ruoting end maintauung a line in the unsettled districts of the interior, but I consider them not more toimidable than those that have attended sub- marine lines in all paris of the world up to the present da) We have seen that the) have not Only been subject to frequent interruption, but in some notable instances to absolute failure Thoae of the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Red Sea cables are sufficient to convince the moat sceptical on this point I am persuaded, therefore, that wherever land lines are practicable they are much preferable Besides, the submarine lines can be rendered useful solely for telegraphic purposes, whilst the land lines can be made not only to peiform the spe- cific work required, but to subserve and promote otner and scarcely less useful purposes , such, for instance, as the successful occupation and settlement of the interior distncts lfj as 1 conclude, it will be found expedient to adopt cue cr other of the oterland routes, the line will,hate to pass through a large portion of tountr) wl ich is still unsettled. It becomes a question, there- fore, whether it would not be desirable that that por tion of the line at least should be laid with under- ground wires Dr Lardner states, in lus museum of science and art, that " Dr O Shaugnessy 8 plan of underground communication, when such a mode of la)ing devil the wires is desirftble, is verj economical Hie copper wires coated with gutta percha, instead of betrg inseited m iron tubes, are inlaid va. wooden sleepers well salurated with arsenic to piotect them from the white ant, and then the) are laid m a trench two feet deep An underground system of two wire3 mat thus be laid down for £35 the mile This estí- mate has reference to the cost in India A cons der able increase would, of course, have to be made for the cost in Australia, owing to the higher rate of wage s and the expen>e of cont eying the wira into the distant interior, but m both these respects thee Jst would not be greater than if an underground Ime were adopted J he adt antage of an underground line would be in ita completeprot^cuon from mjury by the natives, ti e falling of trees, bushfires lightning, and floods, all of which will be found m the case of an overground line to constitute consiant cauies of inter luption and expense frr repa r» It mi\y be necessart, perhaps, tD inform the un lUatetl, that by another tnumph of science, if a fault shiuld occur in any part of an underground line, its piectse position maj be ascertained, without leating the head office, b) means of an ingenious instrument, called a qahanometer-the principal of which is this, «hat the intensity of an electric current diminishes in pi opoi urn to the length of the conducting wire Thus if thiB length be increased from twenty to fort) miles, the mtensii) of the current will be decreased one half The meut of the invention consists m the delicate but periectl) successful means adopted for ascertaining this intensit) 1 he underground S)stem is no novel experiment It has been for man) )eara m extensive Bnd successful operation in London and other great cities in Europe It is an important consideration also, thatthe scantling of the timoor required for the sleepers need not exceed six inches square, bo th»t it is highl) improbable that many part of the oterland line ike requisite suppl) will be wanting It mar not be uninteresting to consider what are the prospects of financial succe»s likely to result from the adoption of a measure of this kind It his been clearl) shewn, I think, that a line can be constructed between Port Augusta and Cape Sedaño for about half a million sterling This sum could, upon the joint security cf the several Australian Governments, be readily raised m the London market at a rate of interest not exceeding five per cent, or £25 000 per annum To this amount must be added the cost of working, maintaining, and renewing the line-esti- mated bt Mr Todd to amount to £¿8,000, making a total annual charge of . £53,000 According to the estimate prepared by Mr Gisborne, founded upon the experience of other lines, and the commercial and shipping statistics of Australia the number of mes- sages that would probablt be transmitted to and from Java would amount to 40,000, which at 30s each would yield en annual income of 60,000 Thus leaving a margin of £7,000 after providing for all ordinary and contingent ex- penses By the joint action of the Australian colonies in becoming retpoDSible for tile funds necessary for thiv common purpose, in proportion to the population of each of then, or in accordance with any otner criterion that would more correctly represent the ad v antage denvi d, the smaller communities through whose territories it may ultimately be found desirable to carr) the lines for tr-e public benefit, would not be unjustlv or opprefsively called upon to incur any ereai er liability then in all fairness the) ou¿ht to beer But if the estimate of the expenditure and revenue ciu be relied upon as even approximately coirect it will be seen that the liability to be incurred is infinitesimal!) small, whilst the constantly in- creasing ponulation and material progress of the Aus- tralian c lonies afford the strongest ground for be lievmg, thit not only will the interest on the borrowed capí ni be more than ampi) covered but that a sinking fund will be established suchas will io a fevv years entirely e xtmguieh the debt The success of tele graphic communication in the colony-contrary to the prr gnostics of menv sceptics at the time of its estab- lishment-offers a strong ground for persevering m tins more extended application of the principle to our communication with Europe, Asia, ana America I si all scarcely be aAed at the present da), what ere the advantages likel) to nccrue from a measure of this kind ? In the first place, the electric wire as regards the fuppl) of articles of consumption of ev erv kind practical)) diminishes the distince of the countries from vi hich they ire receiv ed b) one-half , the effect of which is obvious!) to create a greater equalisation of price , and if a scarcity in any comino dit) should be apprehended, the knowledge that orders csn thus be uistontaneousl) transmitted, will always operate to prevent those monopolies, and con- sequently exorbitant prices which the speculator is otherwise frequently able to command Hence it is that the commercial community are generall) prone to view with disfavour and distaste every means, whe- ther it be steam or electricitv, that giv C3 early íntima *tion of the sta e of the markets But if their interests should so far Buffer, the) wall bo compensated in some degree at least by ihe earner intimation which they will receive of the monetary disturbances which occur with euch frequency now-a-days, inconsequence of the more extended relations of commerce throughout the world, for as the barometer forewarns the mariner of the coming btorm, so the electric ware pre- pares the mci chant to meet an impending commercial crisis, of which fe might otherwise perhaps remain ignorant, until too late to avert its ruinous conse- quences There are many other important objects which will be accomplished b) this means. The early intimation of the declination of war, should England at an) time be again compelled to appeal to the God ot battles, for hir defence, or for the vindi- cation of her honour, will enable the colonists to make timel) preparations against the attack of an enemy And how many anxious moments would be spared to the relatives and friends of persons who make the long spa passage to and from England, if their safe arm al could be immediately telegraphed ? Indeed, the purposes for which the telegraph would be used are to numerous, so various, and so unfore- seen, that I entettain no doubt that if once established it would prove to be not only one of the most bene- ficial, but popular institutions of the country Bebidos the reasons given in the esrlier part of this letter, the piesent, it appears to me, is a peculiarly opportune time for bringing the subjecf under public route and discussion, because the delegates from the Governments of the several Australian ¡colonies are about to meet m Melbourne, in order to settle various questions affecting their mutual interests, and! know of none better entitled than this to their early and attentive consideration. "Whilst on the subject of telegraphic communica- tion, there is a suggestion which I would venture to make, founded upon the admirable succ-es« which has ' attended the low unifoim rate of postage wherever it has been established. I am quite certain that a simi- lar sucess would attend the adoption of a low uniform charge for telegraphic messcges, irrespective of dis- tance, or whether sent to or received from any part of the Australian colonies. As in the case of inter- colonial postage no accounts should be kept, but each colony Fhould be entitled to retain the revenue payable upon the messages it transmits. Now that the lines have been conbtruetcd and stations established, the cost of transmitting a message is the same whatever may be the tlistance it is sent. But as was found in the old i-ystem of postage rates, where trey increased propor- tionately with the distance, the high charges for long distances operate as a prohibition to the use of the telegraph, and recourse is only had to it, therefore, in cxtteme cates ¡ but if it were once known that, by the payment of a moderate uniform rate, a telegram could be sent to any part of the Australian colonies, it is scarcely possible to estimate the increase that would take place in the number of messages-to the very great convenience end advantage of the public, and, as I contend, without any Iobb of revenue. If I mistake not, the unifotm sjstem hoe already been tried with great success in India. This would form anoiher appropriate question for discussion at the inter-colcnial conference. I am dtsiroua, before closing this letter, of acknow- ledging the valuable information which I have derived from the highly interesting lecture on the subject delivered by Mr. Todd at Adelaide in January last. The occasion is a fitting one to acknowledge also the valuable services rendered by the intrepid exploiers of the interior, not only in the cause of geographical science ge- nerally, but particularly in reference io the question now under discussion. I remain, Sir, your obedient Fer vant, ADVANCE AUS LKALIA.
