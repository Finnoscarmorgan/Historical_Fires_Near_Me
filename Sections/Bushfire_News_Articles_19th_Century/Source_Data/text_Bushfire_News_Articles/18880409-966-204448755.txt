COLONIAL TELEGRAMS. VICTORIA. Melbourne, April 8. Diphtheria is still prevalent in many parts of the colony. It appears to ba exceptionally virulent this season. Nineteen cases were reported last week to the Central Board of Health, eleven being fatal. A bush-fire occurred at Craigiebnrn district on Thursday, destroying several thousands of acres of grass and a quantity of fencing. The Council of the National Agricultural Society of Victoria and gentlemen interested in dairyiug decided at a meeting on Friday night to ask the Government for Â£5,000 for the establishment of a travelling dairy Iospectcr and other practical means of developing the dairy interests. The members of the New South Wales crew, appointed to represent that colony in the Intercolonial eight-oar race, arrived by tbe express on Saturday and were accorded a cordial welcome at the To*n Hall. Mr. Walter Macalpine, the well-known curator of the Melbourne Crijket Ground, died suddenly on Saturday from peronitia, after a week's illness, leaving a wife and eight children. The yacht Cutty Sark was raised, but none of the bodies have been found. The large mainsail and the second jib fully set, had the halyards made fast. It was found that only two bottles of ale had been drunk, so that the accident was not due to drink. The boat was stove in in the quarter, evidently through striking a rocky bottom. Several large sharks were seen by the search party, and it was supposed that tbe bodies had fallen a prey to those monsters.
