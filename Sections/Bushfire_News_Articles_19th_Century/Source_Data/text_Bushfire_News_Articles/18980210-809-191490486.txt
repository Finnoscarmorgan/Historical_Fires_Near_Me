YAN YEAN DISTRICT AFFECTED. ARTHUR'S CREEK, Wednesday. A bush fire started on Mr. Edwards's farm, at the foot of Nelson's Hill, yester- day afternoon, and travelled with great rapidity in a south and south- westerly direc- tion, in its course overrunning the paddocks of Messrs. M'Sweeney. Johnston, Bradford, M'Phee, Hurry, part of Cordell's, and M'Donald's, to the south, while to the south-west, Bear's paddocks, rented by Mr. John Mason, were nearly all burnt, as well as a large portion of the enclosed land held by the Metropolitan Board of Works. The , fire burnt close to the reservoir, but owing to some land being ploughed it was stopped just before it entered the plantation of firs, pines, &c.;, at Picnic Point, on the east of the Yan Yean Reservoir. Had it once entered the plantation, the beautiful trees on the east and south of the reservoir would in all probability have been destroyed. About 2000 acres of grass have been destroyed as it is. Messen- gers having been sent in all direc- tions and a good number having re- sponded to the call, the change of wind en- abled the fire on the southern side to be got under control. To-day it is still burning to the north, but so far slowly. At 10 p.m. last night, the flames could be seen for miles towering above the trees in M'Phee's pad- dock. Many of those who have suffered loss will have to part with their stock owing to having no feed for them.
