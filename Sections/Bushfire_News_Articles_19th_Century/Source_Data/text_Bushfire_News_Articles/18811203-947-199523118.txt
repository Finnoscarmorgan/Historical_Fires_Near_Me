:: '_i Mb' GeorOb '^Thurbau.— The extra ordinary manner in 'which tho servicesof ^iMrTJeorge Thnreaui are' utilised'1 by the ? Govern men t' certainly ' ? req uires explana tion, as there seems to be an utter want of system or m'ethod; in-' visiting the various' mineral deposits of the island, ? the rule acted upon ? apparently being that as soon 'as a mineral district has been roported upon ' at one end of the island, he must rush to the other end for his next report. Mr Thureau1 was last we'ek called from 'the north to report oh a coal district at the south, and ho loft Hobart by mail' train last' evening on his way westward to report on the galena deposits at Mount Claude and the gold deposits near Mount Roland. What length of time is to be devoted to those districts wo know not, but doubtless by the time ho has visited a few of the prin cipal claims instructions will bo received for him to rush away to the East or West Coast, and from thero to proceed north or south again. Assault Cases. —We are glad to notice that the magistrates are determined to in flict severe penalties on such, characters as are brought before them for unprovoked and savage assaults, several of which have occurred recently, and on Wednesday there came before the Police Court two roughs who, set upon a man in the Court Home Hotel, and savagely beat him about the body to such an extent that he is now under medical treatment. Mullins, the chief instigator, acted in a most savage manner, and Lowe, his aider and abettor, set upon. the landlord of the house in which the row took place because he at tempted to preserve the peace in his own house. Mullins was fined £10, or in default six months imprisonment, and Lowe £3, or two months imprisonment with hard labour. The Police Magistrate stated that he was determined to inflict the heaviest penalty the law allowed upon all persons brought before him for assaults and larrikinism, which appears to be on the increase at the present time.. It is to be hoped that the examples made will have a deterrent effect upon others. . West Coast Tramway. — From our con temporary we learn that ' the Attorney General, Mr Dodds, when on the West Coast, not only satisfied himself of the necessity of connecting the mining centres with Macquarie Harbour, but had several conversations with Mr Climie as to the practicableness and other particulars con nected ,with the tramway, Mr Dodds communicated, his .views to his colleagues,, the Premier and Colonial Secretary, at a recent meeting: in Launceaton, and Mr Olunie being then also in that town, Ministers had a long consultation with that gentleman, and we believe. we are . warranted in saying that Ministers are now carrying on negociations, for, having an engineering survey of the country from Macquarie Harbour to Heemskirk effected with all possible despatch.' Girls' Indusikial School. — The Com mittee of the Launoeston Girls' Industrial; School make an appeal to the public for suitable site, or the means to procure one, on which to erect buildings for the insti tution. In consequence of the premises at present occupied in Frederick-street having been purchased by the managing body of the Congregational Church, it becomes necessary to find a home for the children elsewhere, . and the Committee appeal to the public in the hope of being able to secure an allotment on whioh they may erect buildings of ? their own for tho purpose, and' we commend their appeal to the favourable consideration o£ those able to assist in the manner indicated. The Launceston Girls' Industrial School has now been established between three and four years, is under excollent manage ment and supervision, and is becoming daily of increasing value to the commu nity. We understand that there are now twenty girls in the institution. ? Anniversary Feast. — The children of the Chalmers Church Sunday school had their annual treat on Wednesday onElphin Farm, near Goderich-street, through per mission kindly given by Mr T. Hogarth. The ground was admirably suited for the purpose, its only drawback being the ab sence of shelter when a passing shower came. There were a good many visitors, and proceedings did not terminate till evening. Attempted Suicide.— About half- past 11 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday Mrs Crooks, wife or Mr O. Crooks, of Wellington street, attempted to poison herself. It appears she had been out .in the earlier portion of the evening, and returned home slightly intoxicated. Going into the room where her husband was in bed,1 she held up a small bottle, and after swallow ing the contents, exclaimed, ' I have poisoned myself,' and at once ran out of the house. A boy came to the police station, and reported the matter, and a constable.' wa3 at once sent up to the House'. ' The constable and a few friends of Mr Crooks went in search of his wife, and found her sitting under the firebell, and at once took her home. Dr. Murphy was called in at a later period, and ap plied proper remedies, and about 5 o'clock Mrs Crooks fell into a refreshing sleep, and yesterday was progressing as favourably as could bo expected under the circumstances. ' ; Thanks 'are returned elsewhere by the' teachers and scholars of the Red Hills Public School to John Hurt, Esq., Warden of Delo raine, for' his gift of books and prizes for 1880 and 1881. - ' ? 'A Speech' by Te Whiti.— A corres pondent' whom 'the' Wanganui Hcralct quotes as an excellent 'Native authority; has sont that paper the following, which he aayB' is a translation of one of To Whiti's reoent speeches ?to 'his' own people at Parihaka :— 'I ? am for peace ; let the lions rago, I am still for pcaco. Twill go into captivity, and the lions will dwell upon the land'; then thero will be no more warJ What matters it -r my object is accomplished- — peace reigns: I am willing to beoome a sacrifice for my object. Thepakehas trouble themselves ; they cannot understand my heart. ?? If 1 am willing for peace, and sacrifice myself for this, is it not well ? All I say is yon, the pakehas, are robbers. I cannot con tend with such. Christ did not ; but was crucified for tho sins of the world [Jo is God. I will be a God, too. I sacrifice myself that peace may be. la after years it will be seen and known, and I will be lifted up, though I am no more on earth. Oh, hard-hearted people : I am hore to be taken t Take me for the sins of the island ! Why hesitate ? An- I not here 1 Though I am killed, I yet shall live ; and,, though dead, will yet live in my object, which is peace. Th» future is mine, and little children will answer in the future — when questioned as to the author of peace, they will say Te Whitr, and I will bless them.' Longford. — The Launceston United Choir numbering about 25, gave a sacred service of song in the Primitive Methodist Church on Tuesday evening last, and notwithstanding the threatening state of the weather there was a very good attend ance. The Rev. F. Sinden occupied the chair, and made a few well-chosen re marks between each speech. The pro gramme embraced a number of choiee selections from some of the most popular authors of the day, and included anthema, quartettes, duets, and solos, all of whichr were rendered in a very spirited and effective manner, Mr 3. Long acting as conductor. On this occasion Miss EL Crosby sang ' Whatever lot be mine' in a very correct and pleasing style. Mr John Long also gave the solo ' ' Whick road are jrou choosing,' playing his own accompaniment on 'the organ. In tho second part tlie solos were taken by Mr A. J. Scott who rendered 'Let tomorrow take care of to-morrow' in fine style, bio powerful bass voice appearing to great advantage, and Mr C. Russen who gave the tenor , solo ' Waiting,' the latter singing in a very careful and correct manner. The coneert closed about 9-46, after whioh the choir were invited to a sumptuous supper at the paroonage, kindly provided by Medames Sinden, Mason, and Howard. We nearly omitted to mention that the choir was conveyed out in Jory's bus about 5 o'clock, but did not reach Launceaton on the return journey until about 1 p.m. S. T. Rifle Association. — At the fortnightly meeting of the Southern Tas ruaninn Rifle Association held at Hobart on 23rd ult., we learn from our con temporary, two questions of importance were considered. 1. A proposition for the fusion of the Northern and Southern Rifle Association into a' National Rifle Association for Tasmania. 2. A proposi tion from the South Australian National Rifle Association for a grand intercolonial match on March 15, 1882, each colony to compete on its own grounds, for a trophy to be purchased . by a subscription from each colony of £50. The constitution of the South Australian National Rifle Asso ciation was considered by the Southern Tasrnanian Rifle Association to be a trifle . too grand for them to attempt to compete with until there was a similar corps established in Tasmania ; and the letter was referred to the staff officer. With regard to the fusion of the two associations, the question was left to a Bub-committee, consisting of Messrs. Henry, . Roblin, Bennison, and M'Donakl, and the hon. Secretary, the proposition from the North (which was read and fully discussed); not quite meeting with ap proval, oh. account of a wish expressed' from the North that the Council of Management should consist of Volunteer officers, if possible. The Secretary stated' that for, five years the S. T. Rifle Associa tion had held its ground well, and it does not. appear that any very great advantage would accrue to it by loaing its local name and prestige ; but the matter will be fairly and fully discussed by its members, whose numbers now stand' at 112 on the roll of the association. Victorian Rifle Association. — The twenty- first annual meeting of this As sociation terminated on Saturday last, the meeting having lasted four days. One noticeable feature of the contests was the excellent Bhooting of the younger, com petitors, the native born contestants carrying off the highest honours, the Queen's prize falling to Private Hanby, while other nations also distinguished themselves. In -the Intercolonial match the Scotch team made 856, the English 809, the Australian 807, and the, Irish 768, the first, of course winning the cup .this year, the English, team having won it last year. The Scotch team marched to and from their , firing mound to the. stirring music of the bagpipes, their pipor Mr H. W. Skuiver, appearing, in rfutt Highland costume of the Ml' Rae tarlfcan. It is notified that the BeaoonsBeld Dispensary will bo for the future under the supervision gS Mr R. P. Dix, of the. firm of Djs and San, ' ^-TheJjAtk MrA. R. Dix.— ? An inquest; -waa-.held at.Beaconsfield- on Saturday,! Iwfore Dr. Richardson, coroner, and a j u ry i «fwhom,Mr H. White was foreman, upon the body or Mr Adye R. Dix. The evi-' dence adduced showed that at breakfast time the servant, receiving no reply to re peated knocking, entered the room and found deceased lying on his back in bed, with his hands clasped under, his head, having apparently passed away calmly without a struggle while, asleep, but as to the probable cause of death there, was nothing in the evidence adduced, no medi -cal\ testimony having, been;; obtained or any . post , mortem, made,, i. though the .service of Dr. Maurice ; might have, been. obtained from.

The jury were unable to agree, and, were looked up until eight o'clock in.tlie even ing, when they returned an open .verdict, that .the deceased was ; found, : dead, , there j iteing. no,. evidence to show, from, what; «ause, and; adding a rider censuring the; police for .not, haying, obtained .medical | testimony. i,: The jremains,; were. rbrought, lip tostown.by land pnSundaytmprning,: arriving a few minutes; after 9 a.m., and ?were conveyed; to ,? the Prince's Square Congregational Church, where, the funeral; -procession web to leave, from..

Evidences of the damage done by the recent flood,, were but too plainly -visible, the streams having risen twenty to thirty feet above their ordinary level, and the landslip was found about a mile and a half from Mr Keernans farm.; It appears as if the whole side of a hill, about a mile and half long (' high' is the term used by- ^our:' contemporary, but, this is absurd), had been scooped out and; lodged 'in the. creek. The stream would appear, after being dammed up to a great height, to have.burst its way out. of .one' side . of the embankment of earth, . and having once got away; to have washed : a' channel for itself. : The reporter and two local residents spent several hours in searching for the 'volcano,' but got in a, fog on the Snug Range, and had to .return without being able to- discover any- sign; :of anything unusual. 'The very residents ;in ;the 'locality appear'to be, ''in a' 'fog' 'about the matter, one stating he had seen the 'reflection of the flames' against the :sky': another that ' he had .seen; the smoke and 'flames rising 'high 'in the air, and a third, described; it' 'as 'a. deep .hole in the earth,. from' which, issued dense black: smoke.' It will be seen by our correspondent's telegraph in' another column- that if the; alleged : volcano' has not exactly "ended 'in smoke'"it has ..proved to be nothing more uncommon than an- exten- sive bush fire. We notice, that the- Mel bourne Age has received' from its cor responderit at Hobart a ..telegraphic ''ac count, .'dated on Thursday 'last, of,, 'an ' extrapifdiriary , natural, phenomenon,'; the alleged - volcanic outbreak .to: wit, which 'is described in a most circum- stantial.' manner as a fact upon which not the' shadow' of '..a'.'.doub't. rested, it being .stated. .that' numbers ,of people are visit- ing the, spot :to witness the sight,'- and .that'' some 'alarm is 'felt,, as the exist- ,'ence of;active volcanic forces iri the island was.not before :-suspected."From our contemporary, we learn that the bush fire , near the. Snug River, which .was magnified into: 'a 'volcanic outbreak,' was' acci dentally caused 'by a prospector named ;Anderson arid his mates when, lighting a fire.on . the' 22nd inst. to boil their billy.' That fire -.had burnt out, but, Anderson,' seeing . the : number, of persons who ' had been fooled, by the statements' in' our con- temporary into 'coming out ' from, Hobart .on Sunday last in search' of 'the volcano,' very, considerately lit , a fresh ' one so that 'these persons' should not be disap- pointed ,in seeing a 'fire 'of some sort.'
