Watfie Planting. : — — i Mr. Ferguson, Incpecior of State Forests, - has senfi report to Govprnmcnt on the sibject owatiie-coltivatiosi by the State. He thmkfCthere are Jsrge areas in the State forests where waitks'might be advantageously planted, provided the strippiiig were more stringently supervised. He calls attention to the waste committed through the trunks only of trees being skipped and the upper branches left untouched. " The folio wing year," the report states, "those trees were dead, and their branches esc&mbraed; tire ground, and added to the danger of bush- fires, and destroyed the young trees springing up around. Occasional bush- fires frequently cause areas of wattles to spring up where no f trace of them previootiy could be seen. These areas generally grow most luxuriantly, and tkfi 1 1 1 n mi a larma eira in a ennrt fima In most instances, they come up too thickly and grow weakly, and would be greatly improved by thinning -out in their early stage." Mr. Ferguson thinks that, though seed is scarce, enough could be obtained this year from the peensmen to plant a large area, and for the future the seed might be conserved by the forest care-takers. In conclution, Mr. Ferguson says: — "Most of the railway reserve offer great facilities for wattie-caisi- vation. Many thousands oi acres of land are cleared arid lying waste which might be turned to profitable accnmf, at comparatively ; little cost, if they are merely broken up lightly with the plough and barrow and sown judiciously with the best species smtable fox the difiSricL. This would not only materially I improve the appearance of the country, i making pieaeant areas of many dreary wastes, but they would promote the rain fall ; in many places, and, when once established and in foil growth, would bring a handsoms , revenue to the Goverumait without modi j extra outlay." - j
