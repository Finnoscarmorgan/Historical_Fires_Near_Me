Now an exception of this kind has lately made itself maidfeet in Maiyborough. The Bev. Mr INNES baa become Archdeacon of that district, and this ' led np to the appoinbnent of the Bev. H. C. E. MOBBIS to the Maryborongb ieharch, of which Mr tSKEE was formerly tbe incumbent. Tbe induction ceremony took place last Sunday; and Archdeacon IuuES preached the indaction sermon. His discourse was mainly, of coarse, devoted to the yhanpe that had taken fdace in, tbe miuifltiy of the building, and to urging upon the congregation the wisdom u and necessity of cordially co- operating with tbe new minister for their mntnal spiritual advantage. But incidentally he went beyond this phase; and then be made ase of tbe following pregnant language:— " Remember that rank-ceases at the church door and the parsonage door. Inside treat the Governor no better than bis groom. Treat; all as bonght with the blood^of Christ, lest, my brother, as democracy increases in power, it sb6nld be. said of tbe church, of God that sbe had Vided always with the rich and never with the poor. The church is not democratic nor monarchic, bat the messenger of Christ. Be impartial, act not as, alas! I see all tbe religious newspapers iave acted: in reference to the seamen's strike. All the religious newspapers, as far as I-can.xBmemfier, have sided with the steam company—with the masters against tbe men. Was tbe right so much on one side ? .-Had thoee -nien who. were fighting for bread for themselves, their wives, '«nd'dbildreo, figbting for the common decencies of life, so little justice on their side, that the church of God most side against them? God forbid. But as I have said to yon before, my brethren, pnt sot much trust in religions'newspapers. They seldom give without guile, or favor the troth and nothing butThB truth. My brother, be brave, and if yon -sometimes feel that to speak the troth to this people would drive them from the church and bread from your little children, be courageous by God's help, Compel tkeiodyto be -obedient to the soul." What bBB occurred in the religions sews^ papeis.ofJtbe day.to draw forth, this, strong denundation' agamsttbein iromArchdeacon INKES, we are nofrln a position to describe, for troth to say theae newspapers rarely come imder our notidj. _But that they have been kicking over .the traces to some considerable extant, "saying those Ibinge which they should notbave said, is very evident, or it is not within tbe bounds of reason" to suppose that the reverend gentleman would. have indulged In tbe above quoted statements. It appears, however, that tbe religious newspapers have aided, with the A^NrCompamy against rthB-Beamen who resisted an avalanche of Chinese sailors to takeXbe breadxnt of thft TOQaths-ofEoropean, women, and clfldren ; and Archdeacon IKNES found - ia this event sufficient pabulum to justify the above denunciation of. their conduct.. And who «rju say that an advocacy of the' kind, ol which these religions papers have been gtnlty, does not" deserve this . censure ? CertSnly, no "impartial person. For, if tbereis one-duty whichb religioos newspaper owes more than another to a communi^y, it is to denoonoe ^reed, the more especially when its exercise will bp generally jiernicious; not tp conntenance, but keep afar oiff, a rsoe that is more notorious for its lascivious proclivities 0 than for moral health, and that, instead of on elevating our own people, would bring them, -husbandsj wtviaB, and diildren alike, down to the very. lowest, .depths, of distress and affliction. Wben religioaa newspapers go in this track—wben they support men-who ate engaged in these wrongs—then they are manifestly, acting against the best social and religious interests of the community, and therefore "deserve the harshest possible things tbatcan be said against them. This, then, was the cause: which led Archdeacon INNES to denounce the religions newspapers so vigorously last Sunday; andj therefore, while complimenting him npon ouch a noble stand, every sensible person will frankly admit that be spoke with no more severity than~theoccasion demanded. Bat there is ecknething else to notice in this sermon.: There is also to be observediii if that broad feielihgof respept for aU classed; thatcontemptofrespeclingamanbecauae he is rich; tiiat sympathy for tbe Working classes, which is amongst tbe nobleet and most practical aspirations which a man in Archdeacon IKHES* position could possibly otter. In this reapact the sermon of e last Sanday was a hippy effort, and. one that: does infinite credit to the preabher.

Very few candidates can hope'io get through an exiamination successfully when they are subjected to this kind of treatment"; and the least reflection will make this fact plain- enough to the meanest as well as to tbe most intelligent understanding^ The result of tbe last examination bas most probably, therefore, been to cauBe a great deal of gratuitous mischief; to throw candidates back for another long period, who, under more legitimate conditions, would have readily passed; to cause a great deal of unnecessary dissatisfaction, and generally to inflict widespread Injustice. A wrong has, therefore, been done; and it is only right, in the interests of fair play, that whoever was the cause of its committal shonld be called upon for a thorough explanation. In one of tbe letters we have" published," the writer states that the inepector denies that there was any curtailment in tbe time allowed for doing the arithmetic paper. But seeing that so many correspondents-aver something that is quite contrary to this, the inspector is evidently. laboring nnder a misapprehension. . Whether he is, or is not, however, the victim of a mistake, should be fully ascertained in justice to . the candidates; and' we trust, therefore. Major SMITH will make the-letters we have pub-, lis bed tbe subject of an early investigation. To increase thB extent of the examination papers, and ait down the time, is very much like'-boming the candle at both' ends.. This proceeding was certainly calculated to pJace the: candidates atia;very considerable disadvantage, without, that can see, in any way-tending-to increase tbe efficiency of ^ department.. The.compUint made by our correspondents demands therefore ]a faff .enqmry, and: we. trnst Major SMITH will lose no time in taking tbe.steps necessary for the purpose. > ' We received thefollowin? memo, from -the graph Office last nightBatavia t^legTApbs that .a steamer will leave for--"Si&eapore; on Thursday, 9 th (to-day),-forenoon. •-. .- . •We understand ttuttMrfleiherraise, the Ballarat postmlwtor, Is about -to taie cliarge of the Melbourne Telegraph Offlcefor a Tew months, and that Mr P«3^CT, :: ffie- ifflistaDtielegraph manager atrMdbonraer *5U "act a* "pottmuttt in'Bsiluxt during Mr Bechel-riuse's absence.

Some very atringect measures must at once be taken to cause an abatement of this abominable nuisance, as at present not only is property endangered, but even life, as the young rascals neither care where or iwlul they shoot. — — _. — - __ ....
