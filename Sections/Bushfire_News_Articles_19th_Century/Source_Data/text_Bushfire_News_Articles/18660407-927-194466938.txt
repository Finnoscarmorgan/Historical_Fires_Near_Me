Tjie Vaults or iiie B^^Ji or Fb.vnce,— Iu tlie vast additions to the buildings of the Bank of France notr in progress, and which will afford considerable fpace to tlie administration and offices now crowded together, tbe cellars nre tlie most important part, they being des tined to receive, like the old oces. the metallic reserve of the establishment, amounting gen crslly to several hundred millions of francs. Tlie walls of these vaults are of stupendous thickness. Ou descending the first steps leading to their entrance, the first obstacle we find is nn iron door, locked with three keys, one of which is iu the hands of the Governor of the bank, tlie secorid is kept by the cashier, and the third by the censor ; so that this door can not be opened without the t imultaneous consent of these three functionaries. We thus gaiu access to a first compartment, containing the fundB for current use. Tlie safe kept here is so curiously constructed that if you do not know the secret of its construction, the slightest touch anywhere will set a noisy alarum agoing, loud enough to startle all the inmates of the estab lishment. Tlie next compartment is circular, and called the serre. It cannot be entered without the same ceremonial, and is fitted with fire-jiroof shelves. It contains all the important deeds, notes, and papers belonging to the bauk ; also deposits of private persons. Here the Doko of ISruuswick used to leave his jewels previous to going on a journey ; Made moiselle Mars used to send her diamonds there ; tbe Kngol d'or was deposited in tbe same place, &c.; After the tcrre come the vaults properly so called, tbe entrance to which is closed by an iron door secured by several combination locks ; it turns on central pivots like Italian dooVs. It gives access to a well-hole, containing a- wind- ing staircase, admitting but one person lit a time, and leading to subterranean gallaries 420 metres in length. These are filled with iron caEks containing ingots and coin.' aud labelled according tn their contents. By way of addi tional security, tbe well-hole might be filled with clay and the vault's with water at a minute's notice, if the safety of the treasure was menaced in the slightest degree, — Qalignani. The following snake story is from tbe CasOc inaine Daily Xews : — 'Snake stories have not been so plentilnl this summer as in many pre vious owes. This iB, perhaps, owing to the large amount of land cleared last season Iv bush-fires. However that may be, it is certaii. that these reptiles have not quite deserted us, as the following story will prove. A woman named Waruc, residing a little off the road at the Five Flags, had occasion to place a large log -if wood on her fire, and in about tea minutes after was somewhat surprised to see lirtt tbe bead and then the whole body of a large snake, drawing itself from a hole in the log. She screimed, rushed out of the door, and in her flight fell into the sludge channel, near the house. Her husband, beins attracted from his work by her screamB, made all speed to as certain the cause, and having rescued bis better half, proceeded to deal summary vengeance on the unwelcome intruder. He found the reptile coiled up in a state of semi-torpor, and a stout stick Boon rendered him incapable of further mischief.' ' . . A Singular IUekeacb.— It is an old, and no less a trite saying, that truth is etranger than liction, and the maxim was illustrated by a somewhat ill-assorted marriage which took place lately between a widow who has seen nearly three- score cummers, and a stripling of about twenty-four. The lady, who resides in a fashionable suburb at the eolith end of Liver poo), J8 a widoft' of bigbly respectable connec tions, and has nine children, most of .whom have arrived at tbe age of maturity. About half an hour before the time 6xed for the nup tials, when the parties were to repair to church, a hearse, containing a coffin, together With three mourning coaches, were driven up to the lady's residence. A knock at the jioor Wfts answered, when the parties in charge of the hearse pro ceeded to deliver the coffin, which they stated was for tbe dead body of Mrs. - — . They were, however, informed that she was not dead, and the appearance of Mrs. ? herself, who ?waB then dressing, in order to proceed to church for the wedding, testified to the fact she was neither dead nor in arliculo mortis. Tie jiarties,_ however, demanded tlie charges, amounting to £25, and, as a disagreeable crowd was collecting, the money was paid, and the coffin having been replaced in the beam, the sombre conveyance moved off. In less than half aa hour after their departure a train o gaily- decorated wedding cat riagca were driven up to the other door, and the supposed dead widow was driven off to churcb, in company with the juvenile bridegroom, where the mar triage ceremony was performed, in spite pf the obstacles wblch bad been offered by the young members of tlie bride's family, il. Jta pHAttyu's Ii^Ptoftirtojra— At a recent meeting of the lioyal Geographical So ciety it, Du Cuaillu gave an account of hia ex ploration on the West Cuast.of Africa. He ex perienced a heat of 148 degrees in the snn. lie left London in August, 1663, and bad explored the Ovenga {liver.. At OJioila ie'tiad nume rous offers of marriage from tbe native ladiea, all dressed in their best, but tbe whole were respectfully declined. 'At. the Babalai Fall be had an aiv-e&ture; with gorilla's. He was walk ing in advance of his party when he beard a noise among the trees, and came upon ten gorillas eating berries. Tbey quickly made for tbe ground and ran away, except one old male, who cams towards him to know -what was the matter, giving aj; . the same time a loud roar, file approach of bis men frightened the animal, which then ran away. He therefore' haS rea son to modify some 'of his opioiops expressed in Wa book, that he believed gorillas are .some times gregarious. His negroes captured a full grown female, which they bad ^epfc tot several days, but the whole of them were' very inuch frightened at it. He had four live ones in his -possession at different times. He saw nothing taTdetract respecting their habits from what he had previously stated, HevJBitea'theNocoshi Kails. The natives believe that the falls are placed there by spirits to prevent people from coining np the river, and that the spirits still at there watching the waters, JFIe escaped many and great dangers and privations. ' Be fore long the plague broke out among his men ; some of the natiyes ran away with a portion of his goods ;. and 16b^. nek,' and nearly starving, he and his men supported life for a 4ay or tiro by eating fao monkeys, and really the meat was not so bad under the cir cumstances. He was afterwards allowed to pro ceed by the Olanga people. Here a Very cunous custom prevails. ... When a person dies they cut oS his head, and pot it iu « box, surrounded with clay or chalk, the whole of which is saturated as the Lead decays. The detcendant of the deceased rubs his body with .this.cUy or chalk, praying to his ancestor at the same lime to mvo him luck. When he receives a gocst, and wants to inake a great. friend of him, he goes to the place where the heads of his relative are kept; scratches a bit off tie skull of one of Tiis ancestors, and puts this bone powder in the dish intended for iiis' friend, who having eaten of it/ becomes of one blood with himself, therefore must love him truly, open his heart ana giyeKtiin whatever he desires. , Be {Du Ubaillu) jnigbT have eaten a little of that bone powder himself, but be hoped that he had not , (Laughter.'X M. du Cliaillu's fur pier progress into the interior was stopped by an unfortunate accident. A pative was shot accidentally by one of the party, and that ex cited the anger, of the.whojs tribe. They surrounded bis small body, of men. armed with spears, and with bows .and poisoned arrows, atid notwithstanding all his declarations of peaceful intentions, attacked him. Two poUonedjurows stpek Wm, but through his preventing the poison .from entering, into his system, he suffered no serious effect from the wounds. He abstained from firing,. but sent his men on in advance, and brought up the rear. At. length they came to a part of the jungle where they could only run in single file, when his men were panip- striken, amj threw away everything |hey were carrying, which waswazednjiontiy the enemy. Thus, M. Du Chaillu had tie mortification of seeing all his collections lost, and the result of his labours destroyed. He was, therefore, obliged to re Sum, and after several dangers and difficulties he succeeded in wading Gaboon. Nothing was done in the Legislative Council Wednesday. Mr. Frazer's motion for appointing feven members of the IJowse to meet a similar j nurahnr from the Assembly was withdrawn, be cause, it was evident the ninj'rity had predetur niincil to (li'feiit it. Mr. Vellnws having moved 'the previous question '' as nn amendment, Jir. Fnizer pavu fresh notice for WednesJaj' nc-xt. till which day the House adjourned. Mr. 1'awkner was evidently unwell, and on that ground postponed tbe two motions standing in bis name. Tbe fcecond unmber of the Australasian Monthly Jlcritw contains an interesting article on colonial gems by Dr. Bieasdale, and a lively account of a trip tn Wood's Point. 'Looking Sack ' maintains its interest, and tbe second part of tbe ' Australian in In-3i3,' by If r. Wabstab, gives a graphic account of the fearful episode in our Anglo-Saxon history, although we bope that in bis account of the slaughter of the natives, he has drawn ou his imagination. Rev. Mr. Wood contributes a chapter on^Aus tralian bibliography, and Mr, 0. Bright ara ac count of the voyage of the South Australia round Australia. Relative to the recent mysterious disappear ance of a woodman named Bond the Tatbot Leader states :— ?' The search has been prose cuted far aud wide, but beyond the discovery stated iu our last issue to have been made in the hola which lie descended, no cine had been obtained either to his whereabouts, or to any thing he had with him when he disappeared. The impression is now general that he was la bouring under a fit of delirium tremens, and that under such inflnence he has probably wandered for a considerable distance beyond the district,' The Herald says -.—The sittings of the Ge neral Sessions commenced nn Wednesday in the County Court-house. Nearly the whole of the prisoners were arraigned for fnrging cheques for small amounts, a class of offences which is becoming alarmiDgly extensive iu the metropolis and elsewhere, and occnpieB tbe greater part of tbe attention uf all the courts of general sessions. The following, which waa furnished to the London Star by a correspondent, supplies some very interesting facts in reference to tbe family aud early life of the Jate Mr. G. V. Brooke. As the particulars were not published in our memoir of Jlr. Brooke, we now give them. The correspondent Bays :— ' Will you allow me to supply some facts in supplement to your memoir of the late Mr. Brooke t What you have mentioned about the respectability of his family is perfectly correct. There are two families of tbe-'name in Ireland— one in Fer managh, the other in Donegal. It vas to the Donegal family that the late actor belonged. He was on the mother's side — her maiden name was Batburst— nearly related to the present Waster of tbe Bolls in Ireland. Two of bis father's family were highly distinguished in literature. One was Miss Brooke, a lady well known as a Celtic scholar, and whose transla tions from the works of tbe Irish minstrels are greatly prized for their own sweetness and their fidelity to their originals. The other was the author of the ' Foot of Quality.' nnd of tKe tragedy of 'Gustavus Vasa.' Tbe Brogfce family were very proud of these works, and hence it was that the late Mr. Brooke received the name of Gustavus Vasa— Vanghan was o misuomer, but one which he himself, as if ashamed of the pedantry which attended his baptism, encouraged. His father, I believe, was originally an architect, but when I knew him he was an officer in the Irish constabulary, at Longford. He died in that town in 1826, and is buried in the church-yard of Newton Forbes, in the same grave with Miss Brooke, the poetess already referred to. In early boy hood he had the reputation of being a regular wag, full of fun, aud a general favourite. He was for a time a pupil of the late Mr. Lovel Edgeworth, the brother of Miss Maria Edge worth, at the amateur school which he set up at Edgeworthtown, in order to carry out his pecu liar notions about education. After he left Edgeworthtown, he went to tbe academy of Mr. Jones, atNutgrove, fiathfarnham, near Dublin ; and as private theatricals were in vogue there, he took part in them, and with such success that he was induced to look to the stage as a profession.' In the Legislative Assembly yesterday, Mr. Levey drew attention to the present condition pf the Industrial schools, particularly that at Sunbury, and asked the Chief Secretary whether he intended to take any steps to in quire into the irregularities by the appointment of a select committee or a Koyal commission. Sir. M'Culloch said that he had attended to have every grievance brought under his notice, and had appointed boards of inquiry for the purpose of investigating the several complaints. — Herald. ' ' A very ingenious thief detector, in the pos session of Mr. 0.' perliner, lately o£ the detective police, was exhibited by him yester day, at Iub ' Private Inquiry ' office, Elizabeth street, to a number of gentlemen. The inveu tion is a very clever one. By means of elec tricity, wires fixed to 'different 'places of in gress to a house, Vich as jtyors and windows, 'communicate w$th a beti in ' jsbo bedroom, and 'the establishment is immeaiajjely alarmed. The ringing of tlie bell announces' as Boon as the doors and windows are opened, that one of the guarded points is open, and' 'until it is closed theft bell continues ringing. Pne of the ac compSDiments to the instrument is the 'touch dial,' which indicates in the dark the locality of each successive entry or attack, enabling the observer, without striking a ' light, to traeo the thief jii hisptogresB through tho premises. It also permits, during the owners' 'pleasure, the separation of the bell from any yoint left open purposely, without leaving the room. By this contrivance premises of any extent, such as storeB and public 'buildings are' effectually guarded. A window may be left half open f or the purpose of ventilation, bat as soon as it is lifted, or disturbed io the slightest manner, the alarm is instantaneously reported— uncon- sciously— by the thief. ' The name of the machine is the 'Xleptescoge,'' and it well deserves the appelationl It can be fitted up very, cheaply, and the wires can be so con cealed that the.bonse or premises ought be full of jieople and they would not be observed, '.
