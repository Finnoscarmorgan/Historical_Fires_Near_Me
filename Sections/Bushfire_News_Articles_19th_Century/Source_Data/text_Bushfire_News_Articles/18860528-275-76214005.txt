The lambing is a bad look-out,some of the farmers having to kill the lambs to save the ewes ; so that if we do not have rain soon we must have heavy losses. Large numbers of sheep have also been . lost through want of water and feed, as the whole country was burnt up during the summer by bushfires. May 22v
