MOUNT BARKER. [From a Correspondent] February 9 The heat here has been dreadful; fires visible in almost every; direction. At Macclesfteld 12 families are entirely burnt out: Many scarcely saved enough to cover them. One poor, man named Clark, after empty- ing his well of water in trying to save his house, saw it in fiames. He lost everything. Many in trying to stop the fire got very badly burnt. According .to reports several thousand bushels of grain have been burnt; in fact, many after years of toil are left penniless, and in the greatest distress. From Woodside way the accounts are not so bad, although many in that direction have been burnt out of house and home.
