BUSHFIRES. LARGE FIRE NEAR MENINGIB. Meningie. December 6. One of the largest fires ever known in these parts occurred on Mr. T. Bowman's Campbell Park run yesterday, by which over three parts of the run were destroyed. It was only by hours of hard fighting that the homestead and woolsheds were aaved, and had it not been for a small lucent pad dock nothing could have prevented the flames making a clean sweep. Several men em ployed by Mr. Bowman at tovedy Bay almost gob the lire under, when a strong gusts of wind threw the flames over their heads and swept over the run at a terrific speed. The men, who had horses, were barely able to get away. The lire has now burnt out. It is re ported that all the ostriches and stock on Mr. Bowman's estate are safe. The cause of the fire is at present unknown. Milang, December 6. The fierce heat of yesterday started a terrific bush fire in tbe vicinity of Campbell Park, a run some twelve miles troni Memngie. The names rose to a great height, as they were clearly visible from Milang. No details have come to hand concerning thed&magedone;, but from the magnitude of the fire it must have been considerable.
