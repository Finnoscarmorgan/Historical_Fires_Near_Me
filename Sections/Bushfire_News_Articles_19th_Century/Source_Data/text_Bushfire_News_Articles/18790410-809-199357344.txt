.4 SERIOUS BUS HFIRE. HAMILTON SPECTATOR, STK APRIL. On Friday evening a large fire could be ob served burning in the direction of l'cnsliurst. It continued to burn during the wholo of Saturday and Sunday, dense black smoke rising high into the air, and the reflection at night being unusually brilliant. On Monday evening a change of wind drove the smoke towards the town, and between five and six o'clock the streets were filled to such an extent as to make it difficult to breathe. News then came to hand that the principal sufferers were Mr. T. Twomey, of Banemore, and Mr. Mathieson, of Mount Napier, it being stated that Sir. Twomey had not 500 acres of grass left on his extensive property. Later on we received by telegraph from our Penshurst cor respondent the following particulars >" The fire was started on M'Carthy's farm, through a man burniug a snake out of a log, and rapidly extended to Banemore. Many willing luuid were available, but all efforts to beat back the flames proved of no avail, the grass being dry and thick and the wind high. The sheep-wash, a large quantity of stock and fences were destroyed, and the woolshed and rcridcnco were only just saved by great exertions. Tbc wood heap, near the house, caught fire twice, aud the loss is estimated at at least Â£4000."
