TOCUMWAL (FBOM AN OCCASIONAL CORRESPONDENT, ) Since the excitement of the terrible bush-fires we recently experienced, things in this part have been pretty cfuiet. The country round here for miles has quite a desolate appearance—not a sign of grass to be seen—btft we are-.living in great hopes of having such a fall of rain as they have had in the north, and I hope before many weeks are over to be able to chronicle! bbggy roads and the country in a state of flood. A cricket match between our local team and Berrigan took place at the Murray Hut on Saturday, tbe dth, when the latter team was rather easily defeated ; but Tocumwal had only seven of their own men (t&'ree of their best men being absent), and had to make tip the eleven on tbe ground from the visitors ; whereas tbe Berrigan club had some of the best of the JerildWie team to assist (jthem. However, a very pleasant, friendly game was the result. The Berriganites treated their opponents to a dinner at Jones's Murray Hut Hotel, which was well got up, and everything passed off satisfactorily. As each team has scored a win, I suppose the "conqueror" will have to be played. We shall be pretty lively here in a few days. We are to have an election, I am glad to say, especially as one of the most popular men in the district is coming forward. I allude to Mr. W. Virgoe, of Mathoura Station, who, although a squatter, is most undoubtedly the friend of the selector. It will be remembered that Mr. Virgoe some time ago leased more than half his run to the selectors, and I hear it is his intention at an early period to lease the remainder. We are indeed very lucky in having such a man to represent us, and 1 hope that one and all will not forget on the 26th inst. that we have at last got the man we want, and put him in his proper place. We have never as yet had anything done for this part of the electorate, but if the numbers go up as they should, we shall not long be wanting. /
