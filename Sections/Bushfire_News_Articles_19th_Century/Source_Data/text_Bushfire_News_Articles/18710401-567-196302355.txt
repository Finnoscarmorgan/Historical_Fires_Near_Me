Another farmer, named Con don also suffered tbe loss of everything except his house, which was saved by considerable exertion. The fire epresd to Mr. M'Bwheni's Kangaroo station, where it caused extensive damage, aud it is said that a number of sheep have been burnt, in addition to fences and hundreds of acres of feed. It is rather difficult to obtain accurate particulars, and the above is all the information that has reached as at ureseot The Footpaths. — Noticing on the part of the Borough Council a disposition to shelve for the present the matter of the construction of the foothpaths, we must again return to the charge. Delay, even of a temporary character, means, of course, that nothing is to be done to render the troOoin susceptible of traffic during the approaching winter. In other words, the public are to be still condemned to wade ankle deep in mud, whenever business or inclination leads them to stir out of their bouses. Next summer, possibly, when the necessity for flagged footpaths will have passed away for a time, the councillors will wake up, and begin to think of spending the funds they have in hand. This money, Twrrowed at seven per cent , they would rather lodge in the bank at four per cent, than apply it to the purpose for which it was bor rowed. Did anybody ever bear of such folly ? The excuse is tbat labour u scarce, and that the work, if performed now, would prove more expensive than in summer. How 'do we know that, or rather how does the Council arrive at such knowledge ? If tenders had been called for, and pronounoed too high, we might then consider tint the Council had some facts to go upon ; but they have done nothing of the kind. The assertion that tbe cost would be too heavy if the works were executed now, and the state ment that the paving could be done chesper by waiting six or eight month*, are both of them perfectly unwarrantable. We believe that the improvements could be executed cheaper now thsn at anv other time, and we will give our reasons. These are simply that a number of masons from Ballsrat — about a dozen, we believe — arrived here last week to finish certain buildings now in progress, and that these trades men will bejdisengaged in a month or six weeks, unless fresh employment turns up. By tbe time tendon for paving could be accented, the present rush for masons' work, in connection with building contracts, would be over. If the extra hands return to BaUarat, our local labour market 'fill be agaiu scantily supplied, and prices miy be expected to rise ; but if we take advantage of the surplus labour that will exist when tie buildings now in progress are finished, the work can be cheaply performed. At any rate, the ratepayers have to pay the interest on the lotn, and we suppose the money would not hsve been borrowed, unless the urgent necessity for tbe immediate improvement of our streets had Veen felt It is the duty of the Council to expeid the loan to tbe best advantage, aad not to ltxk it op at a losa of three per oent interest, trithiut troubling themselves to ascertain at what rate the work could be executed, if under take! at once. On behalf of the ratepayers, we pntest against any further delay, and we trust that something will be done before winter doses upon us, to remove bom the town the stigmi which has caused it to be christened 'Moiopotis.' Faces and Fancies.— The entertain ment to be given at Hamilton next week by Mr. CbttereU, is tim» described by our Mount ft&fnhipr; MntalniinnTY tlipi RfurAjr W/lldt -^ The evening's entertainment was commenced with die representation of 'a distinguished musiciin who doesn't know a note of music, but wbp can make a great ado about nothing ;' and »it- proved hin»»lf as excellent finger not- withsUnuing bis ignorance. Then followed ? mesmeric seance, in which Mr. Cotterell per sonated seven different characters without leav ing thestsge— which was a remarkable exhibi tion of his skul and versatility. Ths lament at old WidoK- Meals over the loss«f her three husbanb ; Professor Fidget's quaint but ea»ily understDod lecture on the theory of numbers, and the construction of the brain ; and 'a fashioiabie concert' closed the first part of tbe entertainment In the last performance Mr. Cotterell proved himself an accomplished tenor, bass, aid alto singer, white his ' grand fantasia on ths gasoline' was so very novel, and at the same time so mi^n^tsfr|p« that it »ljWt^ immense applaus, u also did tin song — 'Ismhoks mein pipe.' The second portion of the enter tainmeit commenoed, after an internal of ten minntef, with old Lady Clara Treouleton's story of her pristine glory, and the many con quests she tnada when tbe beauty of youth, was unUded; followed l-y 'The wedding break fast,' in which the ludicrous attempts at speech making excited much merriment The whole dosed with 'The birthday party,' which was one of tbe cleverest performances of tbe even ing.

It appears that the body of a manwii discovered Ton the Eastern Beech, near to the men's baths. It bad evidently been washed in by tbe surf caused by tin heavy gale thrt occurred a few boors previously. The body was tlmost entirely covered with sand, but on being taken out was found to be that of an elderiy man. Subsequently, when the newt ?preal about town, tin deceased wai identified as J P. Haymao, at one time a wealthy squatter and magistrate residing at Lake Walls*. Be bad resided at the Victoria Hotel, at Geelong, for ten days previous to the 20th int On that evening he went out aboni ton o'dick, and never returned. Next morning a small dingey, belonging to Mr. Fawcett, a boaunat, was missed from its moorings, near tbe Hariour-omce wharf, and * few days ago it was band at Point Henry, where it had drifted tshore. Tbe probability is flat me deceased bad gone out in the boat, sod *u drowned, but whether accidentally or other wist, it iisnpcwible tossy.
