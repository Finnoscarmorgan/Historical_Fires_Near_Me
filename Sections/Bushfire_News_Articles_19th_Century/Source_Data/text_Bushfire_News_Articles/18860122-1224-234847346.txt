" TOCUMWAL. 5 FROM oun OWN cor iii;:; pon i)r nt. I The rain of last week had at loaBt d one good effect— that of putting an e. end to the buabfires which have been f menacing us for the last fortnight. ; "0 far as we know, all danger' from / that source has finally died away. . It was reported at first that a large lumber oE tdieep had perished in the i flames, bi 'jup. to tho present the rumor hnsviUii been, confirmed. ;The total area of grass destroyed I should i. estimate at about 30,000 acres, ex- I —1V6 b fencing, hntB, sbeep-yards, &a.; Another downpour of rain would destroy the last chance of a fresh out break, as the grass is springing nice and green since the last fall. Harvesting in this district is now finished. The yield of, wheat .haB averaged 25 bushels to tho acre. The annual races are fixed for March 2. The programme has boon drawn up, and will shortly bo pub lished. Apropos of racing, 1 hear that poor Donnelly, who unfortuna tely broke his. leg on the racecourse on New Year's Day, is progressing favorably in the Deniliquin Hospital.
