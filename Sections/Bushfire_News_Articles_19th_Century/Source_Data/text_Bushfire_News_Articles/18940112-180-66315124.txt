PE0VINC1AL TELEGRAMS. (From our Correspondents.) NEWS FROM GEBALDTON. ANOTHER DESTRUCTIVE FIRE ON THE 1RWIN. WHEAT-FIELD and FENCING DESTROYED. Gbraldton, January 10. News has reached here of the occurrence of a very destructive bush-fire at Min ginew, by which 12 acres of wheat, valued at £300, belonging to Mr. S. J. Phillips, and 25 acres of wheat and two miles of fencing, valued at .£86, belonging to Mrs. F. L. Burges, were destroyed, besides minor losses. The origin of the fire is doubtful. The future before aluminium, remarks the London Mining Journal, has been for a long while past industriously proclaimed, but it still seems a good way off realisation. The metal has quite failed to find its way into electrical work to the displacement of copper, and as a material for cycle manufac ture it is still a long way off general use. The French military authorities may help it to a wider sphere of uses by de monstrating its suitability for vess?ls in which to store food, liquids, and the like ; but the difficulty in adopting alumin ium lies not in the characteristics of the metal, though these have been much over praised,, but in its cost. Practically the only really extensive application which has been found for aluminium in engineering is in the construction of light launches of great velocity. We may, perhaps, live to see torpedo vessels ana gunboats built of aluminium. As a material for fancy hard ware and metal goods both aluminium and nickel must suffer from the fall in the price of silver. The cheapness of the white metal must greatly damage the sale of electro plate and other substitutes. We see it stated that a large increase has taken place is the number of plate licenses, and that many articles of common use are uow being manufactured in silver, instead of humbler metals,
