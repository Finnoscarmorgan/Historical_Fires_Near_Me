AT MOUNT PLEASANT. FBv Teleoranh. 1 ;Monnt PleaHant. .Tannftrv 4. : A fire broke out on the district road between Mount Pleasant and Tungkillo at noon to-day. . It cleared everything before it. Much property has been destroyed. A large numoer ot men were soon at work doing their best to extinguish it. The heat was intense, and the hedges around the paddocks often make it impossible to get near.. Messrs. Burrell, Ferguson, Baker, Price, and many others have lost much ; Mr. Hooper has only his horse and buggy saved. The fire must spread southwards unless a change in the weather takes place. We have had a few drops of rain ; a storm seems near.
