PEIRCE'S SELF-ACTING BCSH FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Amongst the numerous exhibits at the j stand of Mr. A. 13. Peirce, of Rromby-street, South Yarra, at the last Royal Agricultural Society's Show, was the self-acting bush-lire extinguisher of which we now present an illustration. The machine consists of Peirce's patent double action force pump in a strong wrought-iron cylindrical counterbalanced cistern, upon strong iron driving wheels with ] tubular slinfts. The Adjustments are simple, I and a man driving as represented is able to' throw a large continuous stream of water to j a distance of 50ft. from a nozzle lAin. in 1 diameter. On arriving at the creek into which he throws the end of the suction-pipe, he turns n handle, which wolrks the pump? and quickly refills the ci3tern. When the machine is in motion, the discharge is self acting, and, when stationary, the hand is again employed. The tnncIiineB are made of several sizes, viz., 200, 300, and 400 gallons. They may be used for household or stock purposes, or can be arranged for liquid manure distributors or for watering vineyards and roads ; for these latter purposes n special spreader is attached. The hush - fire season having commenced, these machines should command special notice. If kept j charged with water, they may he the means ] of preventing immense losses of country property. !
