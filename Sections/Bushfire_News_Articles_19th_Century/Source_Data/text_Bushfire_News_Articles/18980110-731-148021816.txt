Melbourne. January 7. The steamer Innamincka had a narrow escape when on the voyage to Melbourne. The coast-line was obscured owing to bush fires, and the steamer slowed down to a speed of three knots an hour. She struck on a rock between Cape Otway and Moon light Head, and there was some consterna tion among the Dassenpers. but n minnfn afterwards she glided into deep water. A hasty, examination showed that her stem had been seriously damaged, and the water was making an inrush, but this was kept down by the pumps, and the steamer reached the wharf safely at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
