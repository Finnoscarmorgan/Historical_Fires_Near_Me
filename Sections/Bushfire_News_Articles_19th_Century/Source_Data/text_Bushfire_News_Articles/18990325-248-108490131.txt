A VESPER SONNET. The violet ovo is liko a waveless stream Celestial, from tho rapt horizon's brink. Assuaging day with tlio diviner drink Of temperate ecstasy and dews and dream. The wine warm dusks, that brim the valley, gleam With hero and thoro a lonely casement. Cease The impetuous purples from tho sky of peaoe, liiko God's mood in tranquillity supremo. Tho encircling uplands east and west lio clear In their aerial amber, threaded fine— Whero bushfires knawthe bramble thioketi sore— With furtive scarlet. Through the hush bo nign Dno wliito throat voices till tho stars appear Tho benediction of the Thonc-ht. Divinn. —0. G. D. Roberta.
