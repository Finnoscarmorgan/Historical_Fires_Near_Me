Quota- tions : Wedders, 5s to 5s 6d ; first-class ewes, 8s to 12a 6d.-Mudgee, April 6ih, 1871. DUBBO STOCK BEPOBT_Tho weather in the neighbourhood of Dubbo has been during the weak fine and genial. The days more parti- cularly have been pleasant : the nights bave beon slightly cool. The country around looks magnificent. There is an abundance of every- thing necessary for stock. The absence of rain during the past few weeks has been very pro- pitious. The young grass will now have a ohance of attaining a sweet growth If we had had a continued fall of water, the feed, although growing luxuriantly, would have been rank, and hence not at all so nutritious. Cattle and sheep are in very good and healthy condition. From Canonbar, we karn the most ohecring accounts of matters pastoral. Feed is abundant, and all stock aro fat or nearly so. On the Marthaguy, the days are warm, the nights oold, and bush fires plentiful. . On the Darling, the plains are pictures to look at, being covored with coats of splendid feed. Tho same may be said of the far north-west-the Paroo, WUson, and Bulloo regions. On the Lachlan, the nights and mornings have been qnite cold. Great difficulty is experienced in, getting store cattle, most of the holders wanting as muoh almost as for fat. lu faot, owing to the extraordinary luxuriance of the season, no runs are over-stocked, and holders prefer to fatten on their own account than sell their cattle as stores. We do not hear of any local movements at present, but expect that in a week or so several mobs of fat cattle will be dispatched to markot. At Wagga Wagga, the prospects of the season are exceptionally favor- able. Of both feed and water there is a super ' abundance, and, even should the coming winter prove a dry one, no scarcity of either oan now be anticipated. On Wednesday evening last a very violent thunderstorm passed over the dis- trict, the rain for a considerable time descending in torrents, and thoroughly drenching and satu- rating the soil. The weather then cleared np, and since then appears to.have set in fine. On theEdwards the weather has been without rain, although almost every night appearances have been sueh as to lead to that being expected. From Northern Queensland, we have most favorable reports, and learn that large numbers of cattle are about to be despatched from thence for the Victorian market, the demand for pre- served meats in Europe having given to the gra- ziers of those distant regions the assurance that profitable prices for their stock will always be maintained. The Betting in of a steady stream of. fat stock from the northern districts of Queensland, for the meat- preserving establish 1 ments of the south, may therefore be looked for. The station market shows a greater disposition on the part of capitalists to invest in this class of security. The recent news from Europe is doubtless the canse of this reaction. All well Bituated fair Btocked sheep or cattle stations may be parted with now at fair rates. The diBtriot stock items are as follow :-500 fat > cattle have been sold to Mr. W. C M'Phillamy by Mr. H. Taylor, manager for Dr. Sherwin, at Narramine, delivery to be taken as required 200 fat cattle (Woods and Wild's) from Esper- ance, were at Quambone on Sunday, bound for Sydney. Mr. W. C.

They are travelling down I the Moonie. 700 head store cattle, mixed sexes, are en route for sale.-Dubbo Dispatch, April 7. MELBOUBNB FLOUR AND GRUN MABKET - In breadstuff's wo hear of a moderato trade de- mand for flour at £14 15s. to £15, and small parcels have been moved off at our quotations. For Adelaide wheat we continue to quote 6s 6d to 6s 9d, but no great demand is experienced ; holders aro less inclined to press sales at these quotations than yesterday, but that is all that can be said. Under the hammer, Tasmanian wheat of rather poor quality was got rid of at 5s 7d to 5s lOd. A good demand for trade purposes has existed for oats, at 3s 5d to 3a 7d and 3a Sd. By auction, eales were effected at prices ranging from 3s 4d to 3a Sid, the latter being for seed. Sales of maize are made to a fair extent at 4s 2d to 4s 3d In general trade, business is extremely quiet, the utmost lassitude having pervaded the market throughout the day.-Argus, April 8.

Abont 1000 head, consisting of middling to good qua- lity, with some prime lots amongst them, were disposed of to-day at abont last week's values, with tho exception of really primo beef, whioh realised over late averages, and sold exceedingly well. Amongst the latter description was a draft of 101 head of Mr. William Robertson's favourite FF brand, from Colao, which were sold by us, and averaged £1115s 3d per head for tho station breda, or £9 8s Gd all rouod, being the highest price obtained in this market for the year, the top pen of the former, really splendid animals for breeding, quality, and weight, was purchased by Mr. T. K. Bennet, of Bourke strcet, at £12 2s 6d per bead. We quote : Best beef," up to 22s 6d per lOOlbs. ; other des- criptions from 15s to 20a.-Fat Sheep : 21,900 penned for the week, of which about one-third were prime quality, the remainder being prin- cipally ewes of a medium description. The market opened brisk for the former, whilet the lattor were dull of sale, and at the close a reduc- tion of from 6d to Is per head had to be accepted ; even then a total clearance not being effected, the trade, in consequence of the near approach of tho holidays, only purchasing for immediate I requirements. Wo quote best Northern wethers, 601b., 11B to 11s Cd, a few oross-breds up to 16s 6d ; prime 52-lb. to 54-lb. ewes, 10s to 10s 6d; 46-lb. do., Ss. We bave Bold 2005 ewes for Messrs G. A. and P.

Store Stock: Demand brisk for every description of stores, and very satisfactory prices are obtainable, especially for cattle, as the development of meat-preserving bos given graziers and others great faith in the prospeota of good prices likely to rule for beef in this market. We quote best bullocks, from three years old, up to £5 ; ditto cows, £4 ; full-mouthed ewes and wethers, suitable for fattening, 5s to 7s ; young ewes in lamb, 7B 6jl to 8a 6d.-Argus, April 6. . j BRISBANE MARKETS.-Flour maintains its quotations, ranging from £15 10s to £16 10s for Adelaide brands. The speculative fever in the Adelaide breadstuffs market appears to have reached its culminating point at 5B lOd per bushel for wheat, and telegrams dated on the 4th instant note that the prioo had dropped 4d per bushel ; large sales being reported at 5s 6d per bushel. The Chanticleer has arrived this week, with 225 tons Duffield's Sour, from Ade Iaido -Bran remains dull of sale, at £7 10s to £8 per ton. The Chantideer brings an addi- tion of 281 bags to our stocks -Maize : This market is very dull, the only demand being for export purposes. Exporters are much more oautioos in their transactions than they bave been, owing to dedining prices both in Sydney and Melbourne. In New South Wales the crop is now coming forward, and the result is that prices ruling there do not leave sufficient margin in the Sydney market, where the quotation was 3s per bushel. In Melbourne, according to our latest advices, the price was 4s 4d to 4s 6d per bushel, and there- fore most of our late shipments have been made to Melbourne. The evidence of this feeling is noticeable in the decreased shipments hy the Sydney steamers. We hear, however, that con- siderable engagements have been made for cargo space in the Blackbird s.s, which will leave here about ten days hence for Melbourne, via Sydney. As may-be supposed, under these cir- cumstances prices of maize take a wide range; quotations are given at 2s to 2s 3d per bushel, but we have heard of small transactions at Is lOd -Pótateos are quiet at about £5 to £5 10« per ton. There is only a consumptive demand, which at the present appears to be very slack. Queenslander, April 8. ADELAIDE MARKETS -Review of the Week, March 30 : The breadstu&s; market has been characterised by a good deal of exoitament during the week, and prioes have advanced far higher than most people expected to see then go. Last Thursday the market stood firm at 8» 9d per oental, or 5s 3d per bushel, at which rate some large transactions were dosed. On Friday wheat jumped 3d per bushel higher, and both on this day and on Saturday many thousands of bnsbels changed hands at 9s 2d per cental, or 5s Gd per bushel. On Monday the upward ten- dency was still maintained, and in the afternoon quotations had advanced to 9s 5Jd par cental, or 5s Sd per bushel. A rise of another penny per bushel was established on the following day, and in the evening a parcel of nearly 15,000 bushels was plaoed at 9s7d per cental, or5s9dper bushel, delivered at the Port. The market remained at this figure, aud to-day things ap- pear a little easier. The excitement has abated, and there are no transactions reported. Dray loads in town stand at 8s lOJd to 9s 2d per cental, or 5s 4d to 5s 6d per bushel, and floor at 13B to 14s 6d per cental. The exports of breadstuff's from Port Adelaide for the week ended March 25 are as follows :-Wheat, 10,018 qrs. ; flour, 1154 tons.-Maroh 31 : The markot is evidently easier, although prices have not yet receded. Sydney orders have been counter- manded for the present. In the absence of sales we quote wheat at 9s 7d per cental, or 5s 9d per bushel, delivered st the Port; drayloads in town at 8s lOJd to 9s 2d per oental, or 5s 4d to 5s 6d per bushel. Flour stands at 13s to 14s 6d per cental, with a fair enquiry-Ob- server, April 1. HOBART TOWN MARKETS.-There has been considerable animation at the wharves to- day, in consequenoo of the steamers Southern Cross, for Melbourne, and City of Hobart, for Sydney, being both despatched, and other vessels load- ing to sail to-morrow. The City of Hobart took a full cargo, consisting principally of jams and green fruits, the Syduey market being re- garded as more favourable than that of Mel- bourne. In breadstnffs the market is not quite so firm as it was yesterday, but until the in- coming European mail arrives prices are not likely to vary in any considerable degree. Fhiur is steady at £11 10s to £12 per ton, and in wheat we have not heard of any transactions over 3s to 5s Id ; holders, however, are not inclined to sell.-li. 1. Mercury, April 5. LAUNCESTON MARKETS-Business in the grain and flour market continues brisk. The Mercury cleared out to-day with a full cargo for Melbourne, consisting of 794 bags bark, 14 bales wool, 3150 bushels oats, 500 bushels wheat and sundries. The steamer Tamar is filling np with oats and wheat Wheat is changing hands at 5s per bushd, and other quotations remain without change sinco Satnrday last. Flour is steady at £11 to £11 10s per ton. Feed oats are in good demand at 2s Sd; and seed oats at 3s por bushel ; English barley, for malting, 3s to 3B 6d per bushel ; Cape barley 2s *9d to 3s per bushel ; fine sharps £6, and seconds ditto £4 *10s to £5 per ton ; bran, £3 10s per ton ; potatoes range from £2 to £2 10s according to quality ; hay, £2 10s per ton. Potted butter is enquired for at 6d per lb. ; the market is well supplied with fresh butter, at prices varying according to quality from 7d to Is per lb. ; eggs are still plentiful, wholesale price lOd to Is ; retail price Is to Is 2d per dozen.-Ritoliio's Mill : Flour, £12 per ton, 25s per bag; wheat,5s per bushel ; oats, 2s 8d to 2s lOd per bushel.
