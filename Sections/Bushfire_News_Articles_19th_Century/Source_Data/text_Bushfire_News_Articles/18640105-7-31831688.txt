KAPUNDA. [From our own Correspondent] January 4. An extensive bush-fire has broken out on Dutton's run, caused by one of the shepherds' huts on the Julia Creek taking fire. Upwards of twenty-five miles of run, and from six to seven hundred sheep have been destroyed. The fire commenced on Friday last, and is still burning, but is going in the direction of the Burra. I hare not heard of any wheat crops being burned.
