SOUTH AUSTRALIA. We have papers from Adelaide to the 23rd inst. The Kooringa correspondent of the 8. A. Register, writing on the 21at inst., Bays . On Saturday a large and very extensive bush-fire was observed on the Gum Creek Station, which BOOQ spread over the hill down towards Copperhouse, in tue direction of the company's fence, where a number of men from the mine had been sent to prevent its entering the paddock; it then turned and spread its ravages to the north-east, towards Mr. Vickery's, the whole of which severely suffered. Mr. Hallett's run also was on fire ; Captain Killi coat's purchased land, Mr. Gehhardt's, and Mount Bryan. It was still continuing laBt night ia the same direction. I have not heard as yet if any of the stock has been burnt, although it is feared that some have suffered. The principal runs that have suffered aro Booboorowie, Gum Creek, Wildoto, and Wandillah, with the purchased land of Messrs. Gebhardt, Eillicoat, and also tho runs of Mr. Barker and Mount Bryan. It is the largest fire, and tho one that has come nearest the township for many years.
