There was a fire in one of the G notuk'paddo'cks, about five" miles, from Camperdown, yesterday afternoon, and a small quantity of the -railway fence was destroyed.

"Vert warm weather- has" been ex perienced during the fest few "pay:-, showing that the summer is still with us. Tho heat of the sun yesterday was very great, and it was made" more unbearable by the hot winds that prevailed during the- greater part of tho day. Bushfires seemed to be very prevalent in the forest country, judging from the large volumes of smoke which at times was sufficiently d.nse to hide the sun from view. '■'■■ The locusts aro still in the district, and judging from the myriads of youngsters now covering the ground,'they are likely to. remain here for some time "oiio-er.- There ia no grass left for tbem to eat; but there is still ample food left for the pests in the eardens, which are commencing to show signs of their ravages. From all quarters there are complaints regardinFe the damage done by the locusts, and the hope is fervently expressed that many years may elapse before they revisit the district once they leave it: ■ Thei mischief they have done is felt alike by farmers and gnziers, who have had to go in* for an all round reduction of stock We have been asked to state that polo practice will take place at 3 o'clock on Thursday afternoon, in place of Friday, day fixed by the;rules..

Shortly before C o'clock the change was heralded by-a dustatorm, and; this, was followed by rain,-which' served to lay. the dust, but did not last sufficiently long to do any permanent good.

Police Court will beheld to-morrow at* the temporary Courthouse, Oddfellow's Hall,; Manifold Street. ;, ySosie time ago several trucks were allowed, to' run off the railway line at Colac, and an enquiry was instituted, the result of which has only come to hand. From this it appears that' tbe mishap was as much due to accident as anything else, and- the porter who - was implicated has been censured, and cautioned to exercise more care in future. Tax staff of porters at the'Camperdown railway station is undergoing some changes at present. New porters arearriving, and the old ones are being transferred to other stations. • Tee Licensing Court in connection with tho'quarterly licensing transfer sitting will be held at Camperdown on Saturday, 2Cth February/ at 10 a.ni. • , o>~ reference to our advertising columns it will be observed that Mr. R.

Randal C.-euier, member for the Haggerstoa division of Short-ditch, intro duced an amendment on the address in reply in favor of an immediate evacuation of Egypt by the British troops. Sir James Fergussnn, tho Under- Secretary for Foreign Affiirs, opposed the amend ment on behalf of the Government, aud made a speech iv the coarse of which he declared it to be impossible for England to withdraw from Egypt until the obliga tions' undertaken by Her Majesty's Go vernment should have been fulfilled. At the close of the debate a division was taken, with the result that Mr. Cramer*, amendment wai rejected by a majority of ICG votes. Me.

Mr. Daskein was accompanied by a charioteer who was but very little better conversant with: the route than he was, the obvious result being that they completely lost their bearings, and only recovered the right track., with tho greatest difficulty. What contributed to make matters worse,' was the loss of the brake attached to their vehicle, which was smashed at a critical period, and was the means of nearly bringing the party to grief. During the month Mr. Daskein will be folly employed in' the carrying ont of fresh works for the Colac Council, to whom he will submit a report at their meeting next week. *■■ Ar the request pf a number of those en gaged in the potato growing industry in the Colac district the hon.
