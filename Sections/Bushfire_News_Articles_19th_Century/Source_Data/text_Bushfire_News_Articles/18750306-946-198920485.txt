TlUODO^'S WONDBBS AT THE MECHANICS1 Institute.— Another , varied and excellent performance was given' at this popular placo of amusement on Friday and nlso on Satur day evening. On tho later evening Mr Thibdbn, ' jun., appeared in his Temple of Miiglc, and astonished, the audience by a variety of ri_ice.ly performed feats of leger demain . This was followed by a really comio song ' Medicine Jack.v The diorama, with the amusing scenes in front of it by most life-like figures, delighted both old and. young. The views of YVasliinKton, Phila delphia, New York, Baltimore, New Orleans, t*ie 'Falls of Niagara, and Falls of Mont niorency were well painted. '. The figure of a beggar asking alms— and receiving , them too from a liidy— with a jinglo in his old hat, the bicycle race, the rabbit bunt, the battle of the goats, with the amusing descrip tive anecdotes1 thrown, in, render the exhibition of the diorama a rich trent. Mr Abbot and Mr.Silvey Renforth sang an amusing' duct, 'The Little German Band.' ?Theri'tho great box mystery was repeated; and the miniature slack rope vaulter went through' evolutions ub dangerous as those of Blondin on the tight rope. Mr Abbott sang the song—' One story is good till * another U told,' nnd the ragaries of the Scotch dwarf wound up the : entertainment. Although competing with the .last' night of' the opera, Thiodon's ?- Wonders attracted \\.u large attendance. on Monday night. Tues day, night being' the ? great conundrum night, the .-h'atl- wns again well filled by persons eage^'j^' see the box mystery, and quite ^'a^iij.eageri' to ascertain who would dnwi-;the prizes for the two he-it conundrums on that interesting subject.

Mr Westwood spoke of the ; trials and discouragements he had sometimes been subjected to, while at others his heart would-be cheered by the warm welcome and hearty support received. He then went on to his voyage from Queens-' land to England, giving a description of the voyage and of the beautiful town and harbor of Rio Janeiro, .where the vessel put in.

His account of the progress of religion in -.Scotland,, of late years, and.of revivals and.evivngelistic work throughout the Highland and. the fur north ern iales, was very interesting, and during' his travels in Scotland he was well enter- - taiued-by muny sympathising \ friends, amongstw.hom he mentioned Peter Drtim mond, of .

He gave ' some' -touching accounts of the privation and.- suffering he : had sometimes endured in his lonely : travels throughout the bush in the unsettled dis tricts, and how on more than one occasion he had, to lire on grasshoppers; and wild fruits. The lecture occupied .'nearly two ;hoiirs, but the interest never flagged throughout, and the audience seemed well pleased with it.

Claus evoked the greatest enthusiasm; 'and she was honored with loud recalls for all pieces.' Mdlle. Claus is more of , the sterling than the tricky player, and ^hose who look for what is best described as mere claptrap will bo disappointed. Her bowingin exceedingly easy and . graceful ; her intonation absolutely perfect; and her. playing entirely free from: the, disagreeable . slurring and sliding and other mannerisms , which many players affect.', The piedos per formed last night were Vieuxtemps' fantasia on 1 Lombard!, a very .brillant,and intricate arrangenient of', the ,rridre! modern school, Tepicte with.'great ' difflculties of execution, .which !were;pvercoinc ! by Mddle.'Ciaus with :the perfect 'ckse.. of , the finished performer which sheuhdoubtedly i3. Following this solo, came Gounod's meditation on the lovely first prelude of Bach, . in which the violin was asso'ciated with very beautiful arrange ments for piano and organ, played by Mons. Rekel and Mr F. A. Packer. In response to - the: encore which which was enthusiasticallv Jemahded, Mdlle. Claus' gave Gounod'a ' Berceuse' or cradlo song, in which' 'an sxquisito Museite imitation was intro duced — '? the audience listening abso lutely spell-bound.- . Perhaps, however, the grandest successes of the evening were the 'fantasia , from - Martha, in which the ever-lovely .'Last; rose of summer' was prominently, introdpeed, and the concluding piece,. ', Auld Robin Gray.' , Both of these . pieces roused the audience to. such ; excite- . ment that Mdlle. Claus had to return, to the platform, and generously' played in response ' to .the first piece, 'My Kathleen,, you're going to leave me ;' and after the second a tarankette by Dancla. Mdlle. Glaus' per formance may be recorded as, one, of the greatest treats our musical -world has enjoyed formany a long day ; and we., gladly state that, prior to the performance of the last piece, nn' announcement was made that in consequence of. her brilliant reception last night,, Mdlle. Claus had yielded to a request - made to her by the Philharmonic Society, to . perform at a special concert which they will give, in order that she may be again ? heard in Hobart Town, '' on Thursday next.. Monsieur Rekel, who is a1 most ' accom plished . pinnisfc, , performed Beethovon'a . aonat-i in C with , much .effect, arid opened the concert^ with ' a grand' tiiairch on the organ,' a composition of his own. : The duet from 'Le Prophite,' performed by , .Mons.

H6:said he wonld and. she: then: said her name! was Mary; and .that she lived at- Mr ,Chugj;'s as housekeeper. He said it was too far to'fetch a' drink ;of ' water, ; but if she would get' up he would direct her. the way to ??
