FLYNN'S CREEK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) December 6. I am pleased to be able to say that this portion of the shire is now re ceiving a little attention at the hands of "the powers that be." Messrs. M'Ewan and Co., contractors, are at present busily engaged in repairing and forming two of the very worst pieces of the road leading from Upper Flynn's Creek to your town, viz., the flat opposite the selection of Mr. W. Handley, and the hill at the corner of Mr. J. Braden's. When completed these works will prove of the greatest benefit to the many travellers who use this road, not so much at the present time as during the wet season of the year. So far we. have enjoyed perfect im munity from bushfirs, which are doing so much damage in various parts of Gippsland. Extreme care will have to be exercised, however, to prevent any such calamity visiting this part, as everything is drying up very rapidly. Were a fire to get a fair start, I think that I may safely say "it would sweep the country." It is with a feeling of deep regret that I have to write of the death of Mrs. John Rosel, a paragraph con- cerning whose funeral appeared in your last issue. The deceased lady was the wife of one of the recently arrived strangers from Doncaster. Mrs. Rosel was attacked with inflammation about a fortnight ago, and died early on Saturday morning. The greatest sym- pathy is felt here for Mr. Rosel, who has proved himself to be a genial neighbour since he first settled in this part.
