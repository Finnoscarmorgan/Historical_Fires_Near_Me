COUNTEY DISTRICTS. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) LANCEITELD. Jan. 9. Farmers are now busy harvesting their grain crops. Most of the crops are cut and stacked, and in many places threshing has commenced. The yield is expected to be slightly heavier than last year, although the quality of the grain is perhaps not so good. Caterpillars hare made their appearance in some of the barley crops, but the pest is not general in the district. The potatoes are looking very healthy, the fine rain at Christmas giving them a splendid start. At time of writing the township is Burrounded by bush-fires, and as there is a strong north westerly wind blowing, the fanners around Roehford and Ronisey are in danger of being seriously affected. There are some valuable stacks which have just been com pleted, and as most of them are uninsured, a great loss to the district will ensue if the fire makes much headway. The monthly sales to-day were not up to the average, both the attendance and quantity of stock being small. Fair prices were realised for both cattle and pigs. There is an abundance of grass in Baynton and Emu Flat districts, and the dairy farmers are experiencing the best season for about six years.
