? TO THE EDITOR OF THE ALBOBY BANNER. SIR,—In your issue of November 25 th your Berrigan correspondent writes, in referring lo bash-fires, M that breaks were cleared on Momalong, but are in many cases ploughed so badly as to v render them useless." Knowing how untrue and unjust this statement was, I wrote to Mr. Cnll^y, the manager of Momalong, and I now forward you his reply, which quite disproves the mendacious assertion. I may add that there is probably not a property in Riverioa so carefully and amply provided with fire-breaks, the lines having been thoroughly cleared of all timber for a great width, and so that they cBn be ploughed at any time when advisable. I may state that in a previous issue, when I bought Momalong, your correspondent in one of his letters made a statement to the tffect that the management would probably not be so effective in future, but I am sure that this has been amply disproved by the satisfactory results which have been realised since the present manager took charge.—I remain,^yours faithfully, Melbourne, December 13. J. S. HORSFALL.
