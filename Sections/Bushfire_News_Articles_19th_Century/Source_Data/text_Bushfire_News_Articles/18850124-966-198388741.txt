The police have made thorough enquiries into the cause of the recent fires in the Hills, near Glen Osmond and Black HilL With regard to the former outbreak, they report that it started near the residence of Mr. Thomas Dodds. The damage done by it is estimated at about £140, distributed in the following manner: — Messrs. Jenkins and Claughton, 60 or 70 acress of grass, £100: Sir Thomas Elder, 5 acres of graJBB. £3; Mr. D. Cudmore, 5 acres of shrubs, With fencing, £20; Mr. A. Hardy, 6 or 8 acres of grass, £5; Mr. H. Price, 3 acres of grass, £5 ; and Mr. C. B. Hardy, 5 or 6 acres of grass, £5. It was suggested that the fire was started by some ashes thrown over Mr. Dodd'eCtence by that gentleman's coachman, but he says that all the ashes were thrown into tins kept for the purpose Jand that, therefore, they could not ignite grass, The general "opinion of the - loBers of property was" that the flames were started by fragments of glass bottles focussing the rays of the sun. The Black Hill fire begon in the Waterfall Gully, on the estate of Mr. L. Emberton; who estimates Ms loss in wood and timber at £300. The damage to the wood and timber owned by Mr. Malpas was about £20, and Mrs. Fox and Mr. M. Shickey each lost 300 acres, of the same materials." As in : both -instances the fires •were thought to, started accidentally, no inquests wfll'be held.
