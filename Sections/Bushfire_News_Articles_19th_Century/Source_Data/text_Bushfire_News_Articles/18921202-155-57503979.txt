Sin,-Now tha, poisoning with phos. phlorised pollard is prevalent in your dis trict and the adjoining shires for the destruction of rabbits, I should feel obliged by. your calling the attention of persons using the poison to the great danger to life and property in laying phosphorous as a poison unless it is thoroughly dissolved in water being mixed with the pollard and sugar, as the least particle of solid phos phorous will ignite from the heat of the son, and with grass so abundant as it is this season the country may thereby be set on fire, causing loss and possibly ruin to many landho lers.. It is very ei isy to set fire to the country, but very harl, with large tracts of ring. barked land atid plentifnl supply of grass, to extinguish the flames, therefore in the use of poison containing such inflammable matter the ett nest caution should be ob served.-Yours etc., E. IH. MACARTN[Y. Delatite, Maosfield, November, 22nd, 1802. The following is a good receipt for the mixing of thqe poison :-Roceipt.--" 1our 8 pints of water into a thoroughly clean drum or pot, bring this-to a boil and then while boiling,( and before taking the vessel off the fire, pot in 1 stick of phosphorous, stir well, not) for an instant slacking off until the ph ~sphorous is well disolved, when this is done put in 2lbs of sugar, stir and dissolve, I then add (in pannikine full at a time) 91be of pollard, which should be well mixed with the liquid. The quanti ties, without weighing each time, are :-2 pannicans of sugar, not tightly packed, 13 pannikins of pollard, not tightly packed, to 8 pints of water and 1 stick of phosphor ous.
