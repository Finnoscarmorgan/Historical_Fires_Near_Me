TOODYAY. An election for a member of the Toodyay Roads Board, in place of the late Mr. Alex- ander Furguson, took place in Newcastle to- day, two candidates offering themselves for the doubtful distinction,-Messrs. James Dempster and Charles S. Monger. The latter was elected altera spirited contest by a "majority of 1-2 the number being at close of the poll, Monger 33 Dempster 21. Within a few weeks another vacancy will occur to this Board, as Mr. Flin dell, of the Newcastle Hotel, at present a member, is about to leave the district. A large mob of horses from the Messrs Dempster's station at Esperance Bay will be offered at public s»le by auction in Newcastle on Saturday the 13th inst. Persons wishing to invest in horse stock will find this a very good opportunity. I hear that Mr. John Forrest is about to leave for England by the outgoing mail. Theare will therefore be little time to give him an en^ tertainment here before his departure, and the contemplated ball in the Easter week must fall to the ground. The Toodyay people are quite ready to do honour to the young explorers, and it would be a pity if they are to be disappointed. Bush-fires in this district seem never ending this year. On all sides great damage has been done to feed and fencing. The Settlers' Ball to be given in Newcastle in honor of the Messrs. Forrest is indefinitely postponed in consequeuce of the departure of Mr. John Forrest by the outgoing Mail to England Yesterday and last night there was much lightning and thunder, with a good fall oí rain ; the latter being sufficient to extinguish any bush-fires that might have been burning.
