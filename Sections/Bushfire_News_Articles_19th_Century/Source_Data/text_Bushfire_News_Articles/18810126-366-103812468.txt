COMMERCIAL. WAGGA WAGGA, Friday. Tno weather since the date of our last report has continued dry, the heat being on some days intense. On Thursday although the thermal register was not quite as high as on one or two days of this season we had decidedly the most oppressive experience of the summer. A fierce hot wind was blowing all day long with clouds of dust flying about, the discomfort of the atmospliric condition being materially added to by the bush- fires raging in the neighbourhbood. As yet we have had no rain whatever, so that the cry of thle breaking-up of the drought has no appli. cation to this district. The country about had a miserable parched look before Thursday, and the effect of that day made a considerable difference in the wrong direction. Most of our exchanges speak of rain.-Express. DENILIQUIN, Friday. Since our last report the weather has been dry and Ihot, and although appearances at times have indicated a downpour of rain, it has passed away without visiting this district; in consequence of this stock matters are very dull. The wool passings for the week amount toI 112 bales. At Deuiliquin there is very little to report in stock movements, everything in this line being very dull, owing to the scarcity of feed. The crossings during the week are as follows:--100 fat sheep (Landale's), 1000 fat sheep (Tomkin's), and 11 fat cattle (Orr's). Messrs. Fiskin and Gibson report sale of 810 ewes, on account of E. Hillson, Tocumnwal; and 520 owes on acount of Wam. Faulks, Cochmue Creek. Messos. James Mann and Co. have sold a small draft of fat cattle and 140 fat sheep for local consumption. Pastoral Times.
