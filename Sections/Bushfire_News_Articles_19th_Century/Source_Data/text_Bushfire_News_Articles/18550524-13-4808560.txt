AGRICULTURE. (From the BelfaU Gazette.) In fulfilment of the promise made in our last number, of offering to our readers, especially to t tich who may bo interested in this important question, wo wish it to bo clearly understood that our remarks will mainly apply to the man- agement of the farms, and the average nature of the soil of this district ; as a difference either of soil or locality might, in some degree, require a different mode of treatment, BB with tho heavy and light soils of England and other parts of the world, where different systems of cultivation aro p'i'sucd, yet euch sultublo to the soil and cll miiiJ. For the benefit of such furmers who may not bo thoroughly practical agriculturists, as also of others who moy ho even still less so, but who are about entering into that occupation, wo .will,,iuitho,first place, begin with the clearing of ahe land, and the formation'of a farm, -,' ! > ;, In the clearing of land, thc.firçt operation, as o matter of course, is the felling of; the ¡ timber, and next the getting rid of it, hy the-formation of fences and burning the superfluity. To such as possess tthe means, we most strongly urge the > advisability, both on ti c score, of having moro Jivailablo land for the cultivation of crops, und ultimate ccononvy, to avoid brush or log fences, which, from the devastating effects of bush-fires; have inflicted very serious loss on. some and prov- ed the total ruin of others from their combustible nature, being almost as dangerous as hay nud corn ricks being encircled by a train of gun powder; we theicforo suggest either to substitute the post and rail fencing, which ¡n caso of bush fires renders the means of avoiding the serious effects of the latter moro available hy breaking the connecting link 'qf that devouring clement, by the easy process of the removal of a Jew panela, asfar easier undertaking.than thatiof either a brush or heavy log foiîco There ace but few rules without an exception, nnd, although even postand rail fences'may at times he burnt, or partially so, we maintain that, where the latter . description of fences existe! at the period of tho extensive and most destructive bush fires towards the close of last year, and at the commencement of the present, tho damage and loss sus- tained were far less than whero tho other de- scriptions prevailed. Viewing the subject economically, we maintain that the post and rail fence Í3 eventually tho cheapest, also in another light, tho safest. Thero are but few brush or log fences w'hich do not cover six feet of width of land, that is, that that breadth of land could bo cropped additionally whoro n post and rail fence exists. As there art but few farms, and those not very .large one¡ either, which have not a mile of fencing, it is therefore evident that thero is nearly three-quar- ters of an acre lost, which might annually have produced twenty to thirty bushels of wheat, oi from two to three tons of potatoes. Lot a far- mer estimate that loss at the termination of t fourteen years' lease, at the current annual value of tho produce during that period, when ho wili no doubt find that tho post and rail fenco vvoule have been eventually the cheapest. Tho othei objection to the brujh and log fenco3 is, thai they encourage and act as a proteotion to the growth of weois, whbh got disseminated ovei the farm, whilst they pbrform the duty of lucifa ma'ches to the fences eluring the dry season, when bush-fires prevail, and from which tho post mr rail fences aro comparatively free. The descrip tion of fence w hich we would most strongly re commend being adopted (and ultimately mus! bo) is a double light sapling or other fence, witt a view to the formation of hedges, The Ksn garoo Island (South Australia) scrub forms « prickly and impe'rvious hedge, and is of rapid growth ; and without going so fur from home there is a shrub to bo found within half a milcol this town, growing wild, and almost unnoticed equally as well adapted, if not moro so in one respect, than the Kangaroo Island scrub, boinci less combustible, and w hich can ?be reared fron: cuttings, while tho other is reared from seed The shrub we alludo to is bo found ii: tho ivioinity of tho southern beach, wit!: a glossy small leaf, a rather tender brittle stalk, free fiom thorns, and although it does noi exhibit a very promising appearance on the nun- gin of tho sen, by its flat top and receding form troni tho ellcctB of the strong southerly windi and the sea air, so generally obneixious to vegeta tion, inland it grows luxuriantly, erect, ant quickly. It is to be distinguished from the native myrtle by its stem being free from thorns tho leaves moro glossy, and of a lighter green and in more than onerespoct has the advantage over qulcksot, by its being a nativo plant,-at overgrecn, and ¿f far quicker growth, and close anti compact, almost impervious to light. Its ca piliilities for hedge-rows have been fully estab iishcd, and with those who arc tasty and take ( pride in tho neat appearance of their farms such hedges ctmld be trimmed and kept at c given height with fur greater facility thai: the quickset, and is undoubtedly the best bar- nier in our estimation against bii-h-fires. Wc will now briefly revert to the clearing of the land, and beg to state preliminarily that ' what is worth doing at all is worth well doing,' and it were far better that a farmer shoulei ihuvo fewer acres of well-cleared land, so ns more freoly to admit of the operation of the plough, than a larger quantity in a half cleared state, as he" may rest assured that foi the capital and labor^ expended iii either waj the additional orop 'on the former _ woult bo far moro equivalent to the capital ex pendell than the yield of the latter,-less ex peuse in tillage, seed, and harvesting; and it is tt be regretted that thero is still a great breudtl of land which has been under cultivation somi half dozen years or moro not half cleared, when the plough annually turns aside the same roots nnd the shares get broken, as well as harness against tho same stones, croating loss of ground ot time (timo is really money now, at the curren rute of wages), and money for repairs, far mon than equivalent to the extra cost of effectuall; elenring the land in the first instance, whicl evinces a great want of reflection and notions o economj ; that while there are farms almos wholly in that state, thoy are burlesquing th Hann, hy " clearing moro land after tho sami fashion.'1 It would ptuzlo an umpire on som furms to decide which was the greatest of th two-the crop of weeds or the crop of agricultura prod neo ; and we most earnestly warn all slovenl fariner», that at the expiration of existing lease! when tho farms will be rolcascd at a considcrabl; increased rental, it will bo here, as in Englanc und in a certain proportion according to th vuluo of the land, the interest of the landlord tim the land should be well cultivated, and such a neglect to perform theirduty towards themselves the soil, and the landlords, by negligently clearing fencing, or needing the land; it is no imaginai; conjecture that the landlords will " weed " th farmers. Even on some farms, whero the occu piers have the reputation of being tolerubly goo farmers, so far as efficient ploughing, cleannes of crops, 4c, a non agriculturist, on viewini some crops, might, in lils innocence, inquire c the farmer, Pray Sir, what is sown hore, when or onts ? To which query the latter might ho neitly reply in the language of the showmav when tho child, on looking into tho peep show asks him "which is tho lion and which is th dog?" " Which ever you like, my little man," say the showman ; and in uko manner might til larmer answer his querist, it being difficult t decide in parliamentary language, which wer the " ayoB,""the wheat or the oats.
