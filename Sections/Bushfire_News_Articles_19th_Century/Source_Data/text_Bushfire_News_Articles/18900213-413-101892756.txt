Naramlera. (FROM OUIt OOHHESPONDKNT.) A very quiet week baa just gone by, Bain has been threatening off and on, but none baa fallen, to-day it looks very much like a downpour, but our hopes will be orushed again I expect. Not that rain is badly wanted just now,"but it is better to have rain than to live in prospective. The experiment in frozen meat sent down by Mr. Manning, in a Refrigerating Car sent up by Hudson Bros*, was a great uaouees, and in view of rain I anticipate a stir among stockowners to establish works in Narandera. Tqe Race Club are having great alterations made in the course The situation of the grand stand is to be altered, a new stand being erected, an<J the training track altered. Mr C. Hardy, of Waggn, secured the contraot for the stand, being a good deal less than the local contractors. The election of aldermen caused a slight atir, and resulted in the return of Mr. Willans for the extraordinary vacancy, and Moasrs. Sullivan, Charlton, and Houlding for the three vacant seats. The next excite ment will be tho election ef a Mayor. I heard Mr. VVm. Jones is likely to be nomin ated, and also Mr. Willans. I expect it will lie between tbese two. I tip Mr. Willans. Our cricketers play Coolamon on Saturday. I hear the latter are very strong) but I faucy Narandera will give a good account of them selves ; but it behoves them to practice, which they certainly h ive been very apathetic about lately. A large bush-fire, burning some thousands of acres, broke out on Browley Station on Friday last. It burnt from Browley to Gillenbah, the former ruu not suffering anything like the extont Gillenbah did, A number of men from Yarrabee came to aseist, and some went fiom town. The wind, fortunately, veered rouud on Saturday night, and the fire was got under. No large mobs o! Bheep have crossed lately. Your Almanac is very much admired, all the photos being so good.
