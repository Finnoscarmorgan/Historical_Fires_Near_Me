A NEW ROUTE FOR TOURISTS^ OVERLAND TO THE WEST VIA PIEMAN. . [By Alfred J. Taylor.] j The chance of getting to the West Coast by way of the lum Bo j Railway ollered a temptation I hate not been able to resist, and 1 left Launceston on the 8th inst, intending to make the trip thtough to Mount Ljell Leaving Launceston at 8 am, one passes tluough undulating country that would gladden the eye of the water culoul 1st, the distant lulls and atmospheric elicits being particul irlj beautiful at this season ot the year The winding Esk running through the inendow lands and tlie gorse hedged roadways about Evan dale, fencing tast fields that are golden with the glory of «un gladdened clops, complete a scene of lural peace and contentment that only a Bobby Burns lould adequately point in words One cannot help noticing the number of fields near Launceston everrun with gorse, briars, and thistles, but the eye that loves artistic eflect ot erlooks the true interpre tntion of such neglect, and dwells on the blue distances ot Ben Lomond, Moimi Arthur, and the Western Tiers sleeping on the horizon Where the earlier crops have been gathered the nettly turned earth is pregnant with tho promise of future life and prospentj In the stubble the kine browse lazily, and the glossy hides tell of the plentt and fatness of the season After reaching Longford we pass flats that were once marsh lands, but which are nott par Hally cotered with rushes and the yellow dandelion There is plenty of wattle and gorae, and the purple background of the hills gives a complimentary relief to the gold of the harvesting In the locality of Bishopsbourne the corn is growing where the helas are only par tiallj cleared of timber, and the gnostly boles left standing tell of the work that had to be effected in the days when brave hearts and hrawny arms commenced the clearings Sheep dotted paddocks show emerald spots where the grass is sprouting from the newly ploughed lands, for the season has been more spring like than summer like About Hagley are plateau lands, backed by the rugged ndges of Quamby Bluff, willow fringed Waters, hawthorn edges, potato crops, and a flourish of docks and thistles Old fashioned Deloraine has its sluggish nv er with shingly bottom, suggestive of minnow and trout-bracken, and briar, and bush on one side of the line, and partly eulti v ated lands on the other side At Dunoi lan aro later crops, and still greater pro fusion of docks and thistles About Whitefoord Hills the rolling dow ns ure v ery beautiful-the old gold of the crops blending well with the dun coloured soil that has been turned . but the patches of white timber make the landscnpe somewhat cold and winter like m aspect Then comes a stretch of bush land, thickly covered with young timber, and thistles galore A pretty river, crops and thistles growing in friendly co partnership, rude huts, a clump of houses of n better class, then reapers and binders gathering the golden härtest , prettj middle distances fading awaj into olive grey backgrounds, and we reach Latrobe, with ita substantial buildings and busj life, its wide sweeps of well watered agncultural and pastoral lands, sleek cattle, and other c\ ldences of prosperity ¡Suddenly a Hash of water of remarkable greenness, masses of blackbriar, great stacks of potatoes reddy foi shipment, and we aro at Devonport Hie town is prettily situated, and the suiroundtngs remind one of Bri'liton, Victoria The grej sea looms iwaj bejomi the little cemeterj, and the coast scencrj is beautiful with richlj coloured lichen cotered rocks Poplar, j cllow gram, and ferns introduce us to rolling dow ns as we pioceed on ourjournej, and bring us close to the sea again.with its Iongskj line, and to the pi etty village of Lillico Another ruer crossed, glimpses of distant water, more bush land, the smell of stn« eui and shallows, beaches of shingle tuat keep sccicts of the plunging seas, then through adceprailwoj cutting, and weare at Uli erstone We now leave .'the' train for tho coach, the line that will connect Ulverstone with Burnie (Emu _Bay) having only just been commenced. The drive to Burnie if very enjoyable, the road maning close to tlie bay throughout the whole distance. At Burnie we rest for the night. At 7 a.m. we leave in the newly con- structed train that will take us as far as the Pieman. Leaving the bay on our left, we pass alternate patches of cultivated ground and timber, brightened with tlie yellow greenness of fern-frond and the light reflecting foliage of myrtle and sassafras. Rising table-lands give us glimpses Of scattered habitations, patches of golden grain, bare-legged, healthy, happy-looking children, an occasional dairy farm, patches of dead timber, and again bands of myrtle and pretty clearings. By 8.30 purple mountain peaks (Valentine's Peak and the double hump of Mount Moah) loom to our right for a moment, and then right ahead, for there are many curves of extraordinary sharpness on this line, some miles of clearing in thick myrtle and ciicalyjit bush (real pioneering work) on undulating table-land give us time to reter to the absence of bird-life in the country we ure travelling through. We pass a stream where the V.D.L. Co. once .had a mill at work in the days gone by, and here notice a wealth of insect lile, particularly in the form of buttcrtlies. At 0.30 we reach Guilford Junction, .where the line branches oil' to Waratah and Pieman. Continuing our journey in the latter direction, we pass the Hellyer River and country dotted with "everlasting" blossoms ot great variety and beauty. Glimpses aro caught of Mounts Pearce and Bischoff lying away to the right ; and here I saw the first bird-life-u black magpie, or " jay," as tlie miners call it. About 10.15 wo cross a narrow stream the Hatfield River-and shortly afterwards reach Hatfield Plains (the highest point on this line). From this iKiint one gets a splendid view of Mount Pearce. Dropping steadily down the views are sublime. Grand rolling hills and gorges, all mas- sively foliaged, with Mount Pearce close up. Swift racings through interesting cut tings, fringed with fern and myrtle, and skirtings of moist gullies that would gladden tlie heart of moss hunter and lover of lichen and fern ; dark mountain ridges thickly wooded away to the left, through a short tunnel, and the " ballast pit " is readied at 10.40. From this the changing panorama is very striking. The gorges are deep, the hills covered with foliage ; but what interests me most is tlie natnre of. the cuttings through which we are pissing-pudding-stone conglomerate in conjunction with slate and sandstone of altered character. The' gullies and creeks are auriferous, and it lifts been a puzzle to the miner where the gold could have come from. I am confident that much of the gold has come from the conglomerates referred to (and which are to lie found in many localities on our West Coast). My reason for believing this lies in the fact that the conglomerates are identical with tho%e being worked for gold in South Africa. I have characteristic samples of the hitter in my collection at Hobart, and the similarity is unmistakable. Prosectors will do well to give more attention to these formations. At 10.M the train crosses a bridge over the Kew River at au elevation of about 80ft. from the stream running below. A man fell from this bridge a few months ago and was killed. Strange to say, his dog afterwards met with a similar fate. A severe fire has blackened the landscape for miles from Ulis spot. About 11 o'clock wc cross Bulgaback Creek, and pass on to button gross plains hemmed in by forest and mountain ridges There is a fine xicw of Mount Murchison, nnd 'o the right of it is Mount Black , Mount Pearce lying far behind to the left At 11 H we come to Boko Creek, and pass through deep gorges nnd rugged rook scenery Then myrtle forests tor miles-the train bein,; above the tops of the tallest trees growing m the gullies, while one has to strain the eye to see the tops of the forests that tower above-for wo are running on ledges cut in the sidings of steep lulls By 11 40 we can trace the outlines of the folia"c iniesscs on Mount Black, and at noon the word " Pieman " brings us to the point at w Inch vv e must change our mode of progression Tho gulf that forms the bed of the river not vet being bridged, we are plated m a kind of miner s ca,ro that runs on a wue rope stretched 00ft above the coflce coloured stream running beneath llio eajrc L,oes wliu^in^ aéross in very quick tine, and wissenden have only a momentan glimpse of the gorc,e as the middle ] mill is passed lint that glimpse is impressive Sending our luggage on by the pick horses, we mount saddle, and for four miles and a half pass over a track that is very fair in hne weather, through forests that have been disturbed only by tho prospector and the sound of the miner s axe The nie is an interesting one, particularly to those who have a smattering of geology, botany and mineralogy The distance named brings us to Rosebery, a group of houses and hotels vciy prettily situated and xvInch promise to be the centre of a very import mt nuning district T he situ sur tejed for a township is not neatly as suitable us the pre ent one, and it is hardly hkelj that the people will reuiove to it The pre ent settlement is open, hcalthj, mid alloids every facihtj for drainage Judging from the appearance of the children, the locality must be health} in the extreme Mount Murchison makes a noble background, and the town ship is ringed with hills that uro beautiful to look out upon Prom Rosebery the journey is continued on horseback overa capital track, through ten picturesque country, for 5J miles, ending at Deep Lead, where we make a transfer to the tram that runs to Zeehan On the woy to Deep Lead an eletntion of l,GGt>1t is reached (Deep Lead being about 1,100ft abote sea level) Making a start from here at3 30 p ni we shortlj reach the Ring Jin ci Hie views about here ore of surpassing beauty By 4 p m we have again climbed far above the tree tops in the gullies to the right, and to the left we have a clear view of Montezuma Falls, the silterj waters of which drop for a distance of about 300ft Western Falls bndge is crossed, and shortly afterwards the bridge ov ei the GreatNorthern Creek, under which there is a small but pretty fall At 4 30 a capital v lett is obtained of the country about which are situated the Hercules, Curtin Davis, and other mines All this time we are passing thickly-timbered gorges, and through occasional heavy slate cuttings we catch a distant view of Mount Mur ellison, and Mount Black stands out clear and well defined And now comes an anxious time, and a by no means pleasant experience A fire is noticed to left and right of the line ahead But the "shoot," to use a min- ing term, is a short one, -and we negotiate it safely But there remains trouble ahead The growing timber has not yet been cleared from the line The fire is close up on both sides, and the smoke is blinding The train stops, and men are sent ahead, while anxious glances are cast at trees that seem likely to fall Some fallen branches have to be cut away It is dangerous to remain at a standstill with trees on fire leaning over the track Some passenger» got out of the carriages, but came back again with their eyes streaming It is found necessary to back the tram out of the smoke, and the driver expresses opinion that it will be difhcult, if not impossible, to get through A message comes to us that a road gong is w orking hard to clear the line ahead from fallen trees The roaring of the fires and the sound of falling timber is now very percep tibie \\\ hile we have been waiting this lire has been working round, and joined the one lielund us, and we are literally caught between the two The volume of smoke arii-ing to the right as the fire roars up tlie lull is a sight to remember A tree suddenly falls just behind the spot to which we hate backed out ot the smoke, and the flames are crawling up the myrtles, licking the lent es to the very t-ree tips Hie crackling of the fire that has reached the gull} at tlie top of which we are wait mg indicates that the position is beiomin" serious, and men half blinded come up and tell us that telegraph poles and w ires ire now down \\\ e speculate upon the possi bility of finding safety in the " Kapi" mine tunnel if things should come to the worst, but an old Western Australian miner expresses his opinion that we would be " smothered like rats in a trap " another tree fallen ahead is lepoited We drink water from a stream that trickles close by, an l anxiously watch the progress of the lue as it is marked by fresh bursts .f smoke At 4 50 the wind rises, and the most hopeful of our party feels that the position is not one to be laughed at I The lire is breaking out within leach on our left, just as the joyful news conies that the road is eleni In a few moments we arc making a dash through the heat and Kinol e i he train pulls up with a jerk, and a tree falls just m front of it A passenger wains mo that a dangerous tiee is leaning over the carriage I am Bitting in, but as one spot see ns just about as safe íes another, and tlie tram is m constant motion I decide to sit still and trust to the law of averages for escape Men are soon at work, and meanwhile we retreat for awhile Then another stait If vv e can go on for a short distance w e shall be sate, for the " Melba flat, just abend, was cleared by heavy hush lires lost year By 0 o clock we have passed some hot patches, but we can now con gratúlate each other that weare well out of danger We reach Zeehan more than an hour behind time Zeehan has become a hue city, and the bush of earlier days having been cleared off for many miles, one has an open view of the country that wies not possible a few years ago All the luxuries of town life can be enjoyed here, and there can bo no doubt about the future of the locality os a mining centre The trip from Zeehan to Strahan is inter esting from undulating country covered with cutting grass-Mount Zeehan stand ing close up in the direction we are going -the line runs through mineral bearing strata, sections of vv Inch are laid bare by numerous cuttings Past the smelters round which now houses are going up between myrtle forest« with patches thickly wooded, but being slowly denuded for nuning and other purposes where the timber is suitable, over running streams, and alongside fern cjaddened gullic-s with distant views of iindulatiiif, plains and plateau lands and park like grouping of trees, we spin along I hen come intervals of button grass plains, backed by dark belts of timber, and so we make pi ogress until Mount Zeehan fades into a blue out line away to the right, and we catch a glimpse of the sea in the direction of Iruil Harbour By 0 a m we cross the Henty River, and speed on through belts of foin and white blossoming shrubs Half an hour later we reach the beautiful waters of Macquarie Harboui Strahan gives one the idea of permanence and prosperity In the afternoon we leave in a steam launch for Teepookana, and it would be impossible for anyone adequately to describe the beauties of this trip up the King River Hie bends of the river give the impression of a succession of lakes, from one to the other of which we pass in a rapture of admiration and delight The foliage on each side is wonderfully luxun ant, and include» celery top pine, Huon pine, leathern cod (in full blossom at this season), sassafras, myrtle, blackwood, gum, ferns, laurel, and "ross tree The rellec tions of the banks in the still waters aie as beautiful as those to be seen on the Huon River and on the River Derwent, and I um not likoly to forget in a hurry the uiiprcs sions made by this short water trip Here, again one cannot help noticing the ul must utter absence of hird life I saw a solitaiy wild duck that Muttered from its nest among the reeds Landed at Teepookana ne took train foi Queenstown The line carnes along first the ripht and then the left bank of the King River The foliage is much as I have just describid, only that one sees an occasional wattle tree, and whole hillsides frosted w ltd the blossom of the leatherwood At one point Mount borell is in sifeiit-as we look up tlie bed of the King River, x\ nidi nins some 200ft below Now, the lulls to the nghtaie bald and bare, while on the left they are thickly timbered 1 ern gullies of surpassing loveliness gladden the eye, and one constantly gets pleasing eflects of foreground, middle distance, and background About 6 lo we cross the Queen River, and have a magnificent view of bald and rugged Mount Owen Mount Lyell, equally bare, U close by. The vegetation commences to assume n sombro hue and gradually we pass into scenery that is black and boro of vegetation of any Kind for what the fires spared the smelters have destroyed with their poisonous breath, and so wo reach our destination Queenstown has been of maivellous growth Where the pniKi|al stiect now flounshcs there was nothing but wild bush less than four years a^o The place is olive with sounds of net er ceasing work Steam engines aie pulling to and fro in many directions ti e clang of beaty hammers is heard from many workshops Hie loud rou or short, emphatic explosions of hlnstinj, opeiations come to us from the flux quat ne s uid the big mine on the lull and full trucks of the wealth won from the bowels of the earth are being whirled oter the steep haul age to tile smelters for tre itmeiit Two miles bejomi Queenstown vic come to t 01 mansion a villa0o ncsthnj, under the shadow of M mats Owen au 11 yell Hie red painted dwellings pic a chaiaclcr to the scene that is most strikint an 1 pro dace an nrtistit cflcct that cannot be con tejed in vtoi Is Still another two miles to the North Lyell and one looks oter a tanoromoof wondious beautj Hie I inda \allcj stielehes away between the lulls and is stronj,l> sii0L,cstivc of the peace and restfillness < omine, after the turmoil that elevated the iun(,ed stone masses that now form the lulls and mountains of the ills tnet and from which so much mineral wealth is now bun,, won Note -Hie followin0 may he of interest to tourists wislun" to ¡,o oter this ro ite - lhere is good accommodation eieijwherc and the fares mentioned aro -1 irst class I anntestou to Ulterstoni 91i¡ miles £1/8/11 (return) Ulteistone to Lum Bny (by coach) l8 miles r>/ Lum Bay to Pieman 68 miles il/2/b (single) Pieman to Deep 1 tad about 10 miles (on horse bid) 10/ Deep I ead to /echan, 8/0 (') (return) Zeehan to Strahan 284 miles 14/6 (return) Stroll in to Teepookana (') miles J/6 (return) leopookana l8 miles, 7/6 (return) ___________
