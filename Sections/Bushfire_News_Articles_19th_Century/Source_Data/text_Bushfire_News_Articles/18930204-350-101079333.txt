Bush Fires. The Department of Agriculture is issuing circulars warning persons against the careless use of fire. The spread of fires, especially from the months of October to February, is usually followed by very disastrous results. Punishment for in- fringing the " Careless Use of Fire Act" is very severe. This Act provides that if any person shall, except as hereinafter provided, ignite or use or carry when ignited any inflammable material within twenty yards of any growing crops or stacks, or within three yards of any stubble field or grass land and thereby the property of any other person shall be injured or des- troyed, he shall forfeit and pay for any such offence any sum not exceeding £50 or be imprisoned with or without hard labour for any period not exceeding three months. Or if any person shall leave unextinguished any fire he may have lighted he is liable to a fine not exceeding £10 or to imprisonment not exceeding one month. There is a pro- vision that when an occupier desires to do any necessary burning off he shall be at liberty to do so on clearing a space of not less than 15 feet in width round the straw, stubble, grass or herbage intended to be burnt or wood or other inflammable material intended to be ignited and giving at least 24 hours' notice in writing to all adjoining occupiers of his intention to so burn off or ignite.
