The-LIGUBIA, s.s., has still the same genial, cordial master in charge, though unfortunately he has of late been suffering from a most severe attack of bronchitis, for which ne was under medical treat ment on arrival. The fine vessel looks a3 well as ever, and having a good load of stuff on board from Sydney and Melbourne is in excellent trim for the borne voyage. During the early part of the passage from Melbourne she had fine weather, but after passing Cape Northumberland it became thick, and so boisterous that she rolled heavily. In consequence of the difficulty in making the lights sha was hove to outside the Passage until daylight enabled a course through to be shaped. She left Melbourne at 11.45 a.m. on the 7th March, and at 2.45 p.m. cleared the Keads with light northerly wind and clear weather. At 7.30 p.m. had Cape Otway abeam, and at 8.35 a.m. nest day was off Cape Nor thumberland, when the wind veered to north-west.and it became overcast from the prevalence of bush-fires on the coastline. At 4.47 p.m. was off Cape Jaif j, with fresh westerly wind and heavy beam sea, but the thick smoke and fog so far obscured the lights that it was 5.20 on the morning of the 9th before moving- the Pagets and shaping a course through. On reaching the roadstead an excellent berth was picked up and the work of loading cargo was at once gone on with. She had on board 16 passengers for Adelaide, and 323 in all classes en route. The new s.s. Investigator- returned from her maiden trip on Friday morning and came to anchor outside to await the arrival of the Liguiia, into ?which vessel she had to tranship 420 bales wool. She started from the Bell -Buoy on March 1, and on reaching North Shields, near Port Lincoln, took in 70 tons chaff, and as the inhabitants were mostly away racing the steamer was compelled to leave 400 bags wheat and took departure on Saturday for Port Augusta, Teaching there next day at noon ; on Monday discharged cargo, and took on board 1,700 sheep, ?which were taken on to Wallaroo, where she took on board 270 tons of copper ore and proceeded to Victor, where sheiMed in 420 bales of wool, and on to the Semaphore,' where she awaited the arrival of the Liguria, -and aa soon as that vessel was anchored she hauled alongside, discharged the wool, and then steamed to the Port. Throughout the voyage all her machinery worked In excellent order, and the trip is considered satisfactory evidence of the adaptability of the Investigator to the trade of the coastline.
