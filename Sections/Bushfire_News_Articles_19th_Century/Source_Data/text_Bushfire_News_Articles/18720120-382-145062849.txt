STOCK REPORT. .. ExPfiJttS Office, Friday, Jan. 19, 1872. ThIe weather during tbe past week baa been over poweringly warm, and tue country bo scorched up with bot winds and oven-like blasts from the sur rounding distriob blazing witb bnsh fires, tbat all vegetatiob has betfun to droop and shrivel up, and water iu shallow reservoirs add dam* rapidly to dry up and disappear. On .Wednffediy and Thursday aome heavy showers were experienced on portions of the lower river country, and between this abd, the Mnrrajt, but none visited d*6. immediate dis trict, though a serifcible and most grateful diminu tion of temperature, took pjaoe. Bush fires have caused an immense amount of damage' over almost the whole country lying between thq. lower Uur rumbidgee and Lacblan. Some- stations, as far as (acid in nnnniPiiAi) Iiava Wn pnfcirp.lv burilfc OUlr. -and the destruction of fencing, has, in the aggra vate, 'been enormous, and, wjjl take an immense outlay of capital -to .replace. ' Hie raiDS of thB ?past week, partial as they .have been, have, how- I evJL thoroughly extipguisbed^naDy fires, and it ib hoped that the worst' of the rieKa-froai this cause may - now for tbe season be considered to be over. The toews by the English 'mail is most satisfactory ; the recent advance in tbe price of wool has been main- j tained, and a steady and increasing demand for : Australian preserved meats is springing up. Not- j withstanding the dratHncka occasioned by the I recent losses from the numerous bush'fires which j have devastated .such large areas of country, the prospects of putoralista'-nay be looked upon as 'most hopeful. From Queensland' we learn that copious raina have at length fallen in several dis tricts, and it is hoped that the drought is now over. In the Far North the rivers and creeks have been -flooded, and' much of the country rendered iin 'passable. On the Balonne a good deal of rain has alsofaMen, and the rivers have risen considerably. On the Barcoo and Alice somn thunderstorms have ooenrred, but more rain is required. At Walgott *we learn from our correspondent that rain Iiob '-also fallen, and that tho Barwon is unfordable. The Namoi has been visited with some fine showers, -and 'the -country is looking well. About Dnbbo 'the'coUutity hits been burnt Tight and left, and rain Is badly wanted to cause tho grass to crow. The feogan alsobas been badly burnt, and many run holders will be heavy loBers. Tbo Castlereagh is 'finely grassed, 'but poorly watered, and stands in need of rain. About Forbes we learn from the that bush fires have boen very numerouB, and de etrdyed miles upon, miles of fencing. At Bourke the country looks' bright bud green, thanks to the recent heavy thunderstorms. Iu the local market fat cattle, it of really good quality, are fairly en -quired for, but for in tenor lots there is not much de mand. Fat sheep are 'vSry dull. Store cattle are 'but sparely supplied, and any good lots doming for ward would meet with a ready sale at top rates. Messrs. Wilkinssn, Hann and Co. report the sale 'of 120 bullocks and 70 oows for Mr. 3. Smith, of -Kyamba, and 30 bullocks and cows for Mr. George 'Smith of the same place to Mr. Rand, of Oura, at aaiisfactoryprioesandterms. Wethers, maiden owes -and young sheep are in brisk demand at high rates. Mr. G. A. Elliot (P. R. and Co.) reports the sale 'for Mr, G. Thorne of 1600 mixed sheep at market rates. In Melbourne fat cattle have slightly de clined in value, grime beef being quoted at 17s 6d iper lOOlbs. Prime Bhcep . have slightly advanced, 'but other qualities Hre dull of sale. Iu Maitland fat cattle are worth from'l6s to 18s per lOOlbs, and 'fat wethers 9s. In Qoulburn Messrs Fiijlay aud 'Co. report 'fat 'cattle worth from 15s to 17s per 'lOOlbs, and fat prime, wethers 8s, Tbe following are the local crossings : 176 head fat cattle (Messrs -'Stinson and Chisholm's) passed on Tuesday for Melbourne— (P.
