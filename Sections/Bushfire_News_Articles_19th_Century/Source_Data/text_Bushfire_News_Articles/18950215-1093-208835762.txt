THE WEATHER. To say it was hot yesterday seems to be Tin necessarily emphasising an unpleasant fact. Still it may be interesting to record that the temperature in the sun was 160°, and in the shade 103'2°—or a couple of-degrees below* the record of the previous day. ' The meteoro logical department are unable to give much con solation. The bulletin issued on Thursday said :—"Except that in the extreme south-east it is somewhat cooler, weather conditions this morning are still fine and hot, and the isobar chart shows at present no indications of a change." The forecast for the 24 hours ending at 6 o'clock this evening is equally cheerless— " Continued fine and hot, with moderate and light variable winds, chiefly north-easterly, and calms." Thus, with the addition of the heat supplied by the smouldering fires in the hills, there seems every prospect that to-day at; all events _ will be—not cool. _ That South Aus tralia is not alone in this matter may be gathered from the Melbourne Argus of Wednesday, which writes:—"The present lengthened spell of hot dry weather was marked again yesterday by a "rise of the temperature to close upon three figures. The actual shade record was 98°. Towards evening a change set in, the wind veering from north east to south-east, but it brought with it only a slight modification of heat. The air became thick -with bush-fire smoke, and the night remained extremely sultry." :
