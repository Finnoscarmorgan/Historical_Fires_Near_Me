WATER SUPPLY. IT is surprising that in a premier colony like Victoria, with an estimated revenue of three millions and a half in pounds sterling, but a population num- bering only three-quartors of a million of souls, there should prevail such a chronic element of universal dissatisfac- tion with regard to the most important desideratum of domestic life, and yet such is the case, for every summer the people are nauseated with special notices issuing from the metropolitan water-supply department, which impose sundry grevious restrictions upon house holders generally, as to their application of that article. Last summer the people were encouraged to believe that an extra main from the Preston reservoir would, this year, abrogate the ex- pediency of interdicting the use of service-pipes for the purposes of irri- gation ; but we notice. with unfeigned regret, that the prohibitory order is again published, and that, while the departmental receipts accruing from present rates are expected, with the proceeds from extended reticulations now in progress, to show a surplus of Â£7000 on the 30th June, which date will terminate the current financial year, yet such is the culpable remissness of the authorities concerned, in completing the Yan Yean aqueduct there is, we are sorry to say, very little probability of any change occurring for the better even during the next season. Notwith- standing the recent reduction of rates there still exists ample room for firther economising the collectors' rolls, especially when it is considered that the urgent requirements of the popula- tion are far from being consulted. While we write, tihe reading of a ther- mometer suspended near us, points to 106 degrees, and the Government Astronomer registers 148 degrees in the sun. Bush-fires prevail in the northern districts. A scorching Sirocco comes southward through the Aus- tralian Sahara ; and the supply of water at our homesteads is insufficient, pre- carious, and expensive.
