BUTTER EXPORTS. TO THE EDITOB OF THE QUEENBLAND TIE?L. SB,--The very astonishing statement made in your last Tuesday's leading artlole, that the amount of butter forwarded to the home (British) market from May, 1898, to May, 1899, totalled only the insignificant quantity of 886th., having fallen to that amount from 614.8801b. for the year May, 1897, to May, 1898, has led the Ipswich Federation League to make inquiries from official sources. It is remarkable that you yourself, sir, did not make similar inquiries before publishing sunoh a state ment. The figures given in the table below have been received this morning from the Agricultural Department, Brisbane, and I pre some you will not doubt their correctness. Exports of butter from Queensland from 30th June, 1898, to 80th June, 1899: lb. Valueo. To Great Britain .. .. 246,456 £8,193 To New South Wales .. 851,168 14.417 To Victoria .. .. 110,624 5,066 To South Australia .. 3.696' 185 To West Australia .. 2,240 93 Total .. .. 714,184 27,959 The total butter exports to all markets in the year June, 1897, to June, 1898, according to the Agricultural Department, amount to 425,6901b., which shows for the year 1898-9 an advance of 289,1241b. Surely, sir, your anti federal zeal must have run away with your discretion when you allowed yourself to be led into such an atrocious blunder as to quote 614 8801b. for 1897.8 to England, when the total to all markets amounted to only 425,6901b., and then to quote 8361b. for 1898.9, when the official returns show 246,4661b. sent to the British markets, in addition to 468,7281b. for warded to the Southern colonies. Again, what becomes of your statement that the butter exports southwards for the year 1898 were occasioned by the droughts and bush fires in the early part of the year ? Instead of our exports to the Southern markets deoreasing in 1899 they have largely increased, principally to New South Wales. For the year January to December, 1898, our exports of butter to the Southern colonies, according to the Collector of Customs' return, were 341,9301b., valued at £16,828, while the above table shows for the year June 30, 1898, to June 80, 1899, 468,728tb. valued at £19,760. A careful scrutiny of the figures for the different colonies will show that the greater part of the exports of 1898 took place during the first half of the year, and con sequently this year to June 80 has surpassed by a long way the exports of 1898 to June 30. Another very interesting comparison can be made in the above table. If you will take the trouble, sir, to work it out you will find that for the butter exported to Great Britain the price received was a trifle under 8d. per lb., while for that exported to the Southern mark. ets it was a, trifle over 10d. per lb., and that for very nearly double the qtanti?y of butter. This is conclusive proof that, nor in the maize, bacon, and ham, so in the Ibtter trade, the Southern markets are considerably better than the English, and it would be foolish in the ex treme for our farmers not to vote for feder ation, which would keep open and still further open the Southern markets eo us. Your laboured attempts to prove that the present price of Victorian butter would. if there ,ere no duty, reduce the Brisbane quotation, fall very lisat when the fact remains that in spite of the duty the Brisbane market has fallen, your own quoted Ipswich price having been 9d. for some time and the best in Brisbane 10d. to lid.; and again, notwithstanding the Victorian competition, free-trade Sydney still leads the market in price. The faet of the matter is that market our home butter is largely ruled by the price we can get for our exports; and, as has been pointed out before, having reached the ex porting stage the duty becomes inoperative. When through drought or other calamity we are forced to import, the consumer's intereet should be considered a little. Seeing that in such a ease the producer has none or very little to sell, the I duty cannot help him, while the abolition of the duty oheapens the article to the consumer. Yours faithfully, JOSEPH HARGREAVES. Ipswihob, August 17.
