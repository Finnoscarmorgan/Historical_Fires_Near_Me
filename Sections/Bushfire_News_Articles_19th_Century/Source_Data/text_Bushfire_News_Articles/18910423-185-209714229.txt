WASTE LANDS AND SURPLUS LABOR. TO THE EDITOR. -Yours, &c; , JOHN R. JOPLING. SIR,—If “Wattle Blossom” will pl a ce himself in communication with me I can show him a clipping from the Australasian containing a report from Mr Geo. S. Perrin, C.F.,F.L.5., to the Hon. J. L. Dow when Minister of Lauda, &c.;, pninth g out a profit uii the growth of 100 acres of acacia py. cantha amounting to over £3OOO in soma seven or eight years. It looks veiy well on paper, but there is a great deal of buncnmba about such balance-sheets, as what about bushfires, parasites, stunted growths, "and the thousand natural shocks plant life is heir to? 1 ’ A lecturer on Saturday night stated in reference"fo firewood, that out of every 7s was labor; the cost, Is, alluwed for cart age, licenses, wear and tear is simply absurd,. Trusting I have not trespassed too far.-
