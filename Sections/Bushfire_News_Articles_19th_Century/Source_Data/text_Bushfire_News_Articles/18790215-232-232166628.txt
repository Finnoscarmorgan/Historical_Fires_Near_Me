THE BUSH-FIRES AT CGLAC. [Br ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.] COLAC, FRIBAT EVENING. fFROU OUR dWK COBHEBPOKVEKT.) At the police court to-day three men—John Martin, Win. North, Win. Eaper—and a lad, son of the last-named defendant, were proceeded against for the careless use of fire. There was no more evidence against them than there was in the case yesterday against Witchell Standley, the supposed author of tbe late disastrous fire, yet the defendant in each case was fined £5 and costs, with the exception of the case against Baper's child, who was fined the nominal sum of one shilling. It is thought that The Courier telegram, and the ecatbing article in tbe Herald this morning, sharpened Inspector Burton up somewhat, so that be vigorously prosecuted for the minor offence. The evidence against the defendants to-day waa merely of a circumstantial nature.
