The work reaping by hand would- not pay, as one mancould not t&p.; all his wheat, and mencould BOt beJ&t; just at the time. MaichmeJy was was wanted—one mw could do notnffig" to grow wheat, when there were twelve who would grow wheat likehe had they could afford to get machineiy.'- If all the selectors here will put inf -'five, ten^ttr fifteen,acres they will soon get along. %I£ they "wanted to make farming a success they must put their shoulders to Ihe wheel and help each other. .
