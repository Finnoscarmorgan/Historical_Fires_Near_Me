NEWS OF THE WEEKo We have seen the last of Mr Henry Miller's Land Society. After a career of only a few; months, but sufficiently long to convince the shareholders that the scheme was a failure, the society on Tuesday woundup its affairs. We un derstand not a single application had been mt.de for land under the regulations of the society, so much lauded by Mr Duffy and the Collins street organ. An expenditure of £300 had. been in-, curred, amounting to 3s 6d per share ; and the balance of the naid-uo canital havinff heeii re funded, the company was dissolved. Mr Miller has been rather unfortunate in his speculations of latei; The Government Gazette of last Friday notifies that the lands in the following agricultural areas haw been withdrawn from selection, namely s ,Bealanbarry, Condah, Eurambeen, Flinders, Hen tyhurat, Hoddle, Ligarwood, Myamyn, Warrab-; -kobk, Weerangourt, Woodriaggerak, Woorndoo,; arid Yuppeckiar. They will be open for selection . ..? ^n, March. ,'-.;? , ?.,,-..;. ,.-''. ?:- '... ? , 'j „.. . We observe from the report of a meeting held; 'at Ingiewood, on Wednesday, that the local sub-) 'sciiptions for the sufferers by the late fire amount; J.o£SM. To this sum will have to be added the: (3;oyernment grant, and the Melbourne, DunQlly, 'Sandhurst, and Castlemaine subscription lists,' ??whieh have yet ?to be returned. The Melbourne; . subscription announced as collected was £392. . , : ! Four new steamers, are now building in England fox the Queensland Steam Navigation Company,' and two are to be brought out for the Intercolonial Steam Navigation Company. Agents of each; «vv company have gone Home bytne JNortnam, to, H - superintend and bring out the respective vessels. j&| ; . There seems to be some difficulty at present in || obtaining the services of agricultural laborers for % , ' the harvest in various parts of the country. The M i.Creswick and Cluries Advertiser states, that an M t agriculturist of the neighborhood a few days ago,' [ 'at'Geelong, engaged about thirty men to work 'on his farm, when only a; fourth of the number t; chose to come up. Meeting several parties on his road to Creswick he offered them employment,1 '?which they declined, and, in order to avoid serious ?loss, he had to employ Chinamen. ? . /:; ' - T - The horses and equipments of Howitt's party ? .were sold at Adelaide on the 17th inst. There * -was a large attendance, and the bidding, though 1 notvery high, was jpretty brisk; Burke's horse, r. Farmer, fetched £30, and was bought by Mr J& , B. Murray, M.P.; Wills' horse was sold for £10, f and Howitt's horse went for £21 ; 5s. The other , ' 'horses realised from £6 to £18 5s, averaging about .- ten guineas. The saddles, packsaddles, and other articles sold very well. Y3-irtna T.qyiiI ttrrtiilfl anno'jr frt liovn tia rtvani- i*a liance on the assurance either of its representa \- ?live'' or of the Commissioner of Roads with re l - ? gard to the expenditure of the sum kept back put , of the amount granted for the formation and ' maintenance of the main line of road. Mr John '. son in a letter to the Gipps Land Times on the t , ,17th inst., Bays:— 'I went at once to Mr Mit chell, and am happy to inform you that the sum 1 ' is at once to be expended on such portions of the :. road where it is most needed.' Whereupon the . , Times remarks -r-' We are afraid that, notwith standing the trouble Mr Johnson has taken in ? this matter, he is thoroughly deceived by Mr , - Mitchell, who has promised more than he can per* './orm. We believe that there is no secret in the fact that there is no work laid out by the Road -'Engineer's department which can absorb this \- ? amount or any portion of it, and that it is now, and has been for some time, the intention of the ' Roads and Bridges Department to permit this 1 amount to lapse, and to make fresh application .'? for the amount in the estimates of 1863, with such additional Bum as will cover the necessary ex penditure in making the Latrobe bridge a port ' cullis. The Road Engineer and his staff have been . .- occupied for nearly three months in drawing plans and making specifications for this work, and i . ' consequently they have no time left unoccupied i by which they could have had any of the neces i ; ,aary specifications prepared for works which are . so much wanted on the main road, and for which 'purpose the money was originally granted. The . close of 1862 is now at hand, and' all monies not expended or in course of expenditure on the 31st of December, six days hence, must lapse back ?' again to the Government.' , v ' Some gentlemen in Ballaarat have organised themselves into a committee with a view to having ? v, Becker's remains properly buried in a civilised part of the colony. The arrangements for the approaching funeral ' of Burke and Wills are now completed. ' Com .-! plaints having been made, to the Exploration ; Committee from various qukrjers about the order. ^ .of the funeral procession that haB been published, c : arid applications for places in it having been pro -. posed, the committee have made some modifica tions of the programme. Mr Burke's nurse ex pressed a strong desire to be present at the funeral, \l and her request has been acceded to. She is to have a seat in one of the mourning carriages. The alterations made in the order of the proces sion are as follows :— Mr H. A. Bookey, who is a .. relative of Mr Burke, is to be' allowed to attend the funeral as one of the chief mourners; the Consuls are to follow his Excel lency's carriage; the Mayor and Corpora tion of Melbourne will follow the members of the Legislative Assembly; the Vice . Chancellor and members of the Melbourne Uni ? versity have been placed after the Corporation, , and the Ancient Older of Rechabites, who had been omitted, will follow the . .Grand United Order of Odd Fellows. On the evening of the funeral a public banquet is to be held, at which an address will be presented to Mr Howitt, expressing the high estimation of the committee of the manner in which his duties ' have been performed, with photographic copies to the other members of the expedition, and to the .'. crew of the Victoria. Addresses will, at the same time, be presented to Mr Ambrose Kyte, and Capt. Norman, of the Victoria. The services of Mr Howitt's party are to be retained until after the funeral. Two of the party, Messrs Aitken and Phillips, have now gone on to the Wimmera with the camels. M'William re mains in Adelaide. The remainder cxe now in Melbourne, and in good health. Mr Howitt, pursuant to instructions, has left at Cooper's Creek, irx a cache, various kinds of stores, including;clbthing, which would be suf ficientto supply a party of twelve men for a fort night. He has not kept a journal, but Dr Mur ray's private diary, while stopping at Cooper's Creek, is to - be placed at the service of the Com mittee as soon as it can be transcribed. Mr Howitt lias brought down sa valuable collectioru-f weeds indigenouato the district of Cooper's Creek, and also a number of geological and mineralogical specimens, with some photographs which have yet to undergo a procesa of development. ? '\ The Gazette, of Tuesday contains a despatch fg)m the GoWnor of Queensland, conveying the resolutions passed at the public' meeting at Bris bane on the 8th. inst, acknowledging the cordial reception and hospitable treatment accorded to Mr Landsborough, the .explorer, on hiB visit to Victoria.1'- ; '? ..; ..-X:1:,. U. ;~~:\ ?? ? Mr Assistant-Surveyor M'Donald has reported, to theV Goveinmerit on the progress he haB made: with the survey of -a road toGipps Land; from' Yallock .to Morwelli It isrproposed that:the| road shall diverge from the lower Gipps Land \ road atTobin Yaliocik. bridge, and join xipph the j upper road at 'he Morwell bridge. Mr McDonald! ?kept along the Dividing Range— a task of great! difficulty, on account of the irregularity of the | country and of the 'density of the scrub ; and re-: ports that, with the exception of a few places, an| excellent road may, when cleared, be had to Gipps , Land. The range is crooked, yet the distance is' very little '???' irx excess of ' that by the Fern Tree | Gullies. r The1 coBt of clearing, together with the - expense of making ,a few. side i cuttings, isflsti-! mated at about . £10,000. f For that sum he con- i siderB thatj a thoroughly good rbadi one chainj wide, could ;be made, which .would be practicable fer travelling day or night. . He mentions as one .of! the greatest objections tothis road the scarcity of] feed for stock, there ? being1 a length 'of nearly; fifty miles ih;whlch the only herbage to be obtained; is ferns, sword grass, and a small quantity of i creeping grassy but looks forward to hotel-Keepers! along the road clearing and! sowing padddekawith grass. Mr M'Donald states that he has met withj no. surface, indications .of gold ; but at . a. creek! during his .return from; 4he Morwell one of the! men;made shift to wash two paniiikinfuls of earth; from the bed of the .creek jnthe lid of the 'ibilly,'; and found .a large percentage of black sand.. : A shbrt distance iower down the came creek a quari-| tity of lignite 'was found. A vein of soft earthy coal about three inches thick and fourteen wide was likewise discovered. Hunting in. the Geelong' district appears likely to be at a low ebb next season. The hounds of the Geelong and Western District Hunt Club are advertised to be sold by auction in about a fort night hence. We are sorry to note the, prevalence of fires in the agricultural oisiricts, attriDutea to tne in cendiary. On the 24th instant a large stack of wheat was burnt on the farm of Mr 'William Gould, at Burrumbeet. The Ballaarat Star says there is reason to suppose that the fire was mali ciously lighted by discharged servants ; one of whom, AndreW Henrehen, has been arrested and brought before the Learmouth Bench, and re manded for a -vk^ek. The same journal mentions that a fire broke out on Saturday night, in the paddock of Mr\R. Kemp, at CoghUl's Creek, among some oat stubble. Fortunately, most of the oats from that part of the paddock had been carted away previously, and the fite extended to. only some sixty sheaves bound on the same morn ing, of the value of about £2. A large' number of men from adjoining farms were speedily on the spot with sacks and branches, by which means a serious conflagration was prevented. There is no reason to' suppose that the nre was^the work of an incendiary. ; - Mr Bruce's Bcherae, ' A new way to pay old debtB,' was brought to a satisfactory arid success ful conclusion on Tuesclay, by, a grand calico baU in the Exhibition Building. ; The building was beautifully decorated for the- occasion, with flags and evergreeri8 in gala . profusion, and presented a remarkably gay appearance. At the western end, above the dais, a flag was displayed bearing the name of Mr Bruce, and the same gentleman's nomenclature alsoshone resplendent as gaB could make it at the eastern end of the hall. The arrangements for the festivity were very com plete. Mr Chapman's band was engaged for the occasion, and produced some of the newest and best dance music. The caterer's department was presided over by Mr M'Girr. There was no set supper, but refreshments, inoluding wines, were served throughout the evening.' Dansing was ! commenced shortly after nine o'clock, when there were about 400 ladieB and gentlemen present. This number, however, rapidly increased, and in all there were about double that number, present during the night. The dresses of the ladies; as requested, were chiefly of white calico, trimmed in every style that could possibly be thought of, and the majority were in good taste and looked extremely well. The gentlemen, also, for the most pert, appeared in calico, and the taste dis- - played in form and color by many, of them , verged on the fantastic. White jackets pfedo'r miriated,' arid there were many tastefully triinmed jumpers. Similar garments of colored flannel, were also worn by some. Those who, did not adopt the costume of the occasion appeared in ordinary evening dress. The number of dances on the programme was 26,- and dancing was kept up until tho bmall hours had considerably ad vanced.' '?????'?.;? ? ??'.,''..' ?????? .'?? The Board appointed by the Minister of Public Works to examine and report tin the seven plans submitted for the supply of water to Castlemaine and Sandhurst, have recommended that the nrot premium bo awarded to that marked 'PrcgreBs/' and that the author be requested to make the' necessary surveys,; and that the second premium be awarded to that marked 'Eureka.' The design marked ??Progress' is by Mr Joseph Brady, of Kyneton, and that marked ?? Eureka', by Mr F. Aoheson, of Melbourne. The Minister of Works has accepted the recommendation of the Board, and ordered accordingly; The conduct of a magistrate has been gravely impugned by a border contemporary, under the following circumstances s — At the Police Court of Corowa, on the 23rd instant, before MeBsra B. Brown, D. P. Keogh, and H. C. Jeftrey, Robert Smithrick, John Ryan, John Looney, and Thomas Davis, weia ohorged with having orossed 300 head of cattle over the Murray at Mulwala, without tho aaid cattle oeing inspected, alao that Mulwala was not a oroeaing place for oattle. Defendanto pleaded ) guilty, but alleged they did not know, that Corowa wasvappointed a crossing place^ in stead of Mulwala, The benoh said it was.bound to enforce the provi^ons of the Act, ^and accord ingly' confiscated the cattle, and enforced ;the penalty. Under the circumstances of ;the case, the bench intimated that the Government would be -asked to mitigate; .the- penalty. In reference to this case, the Border Post of the' 27th makes the following statement :— ' Waiting the disposal of the Government, these cattle were placed on or near Honeysuckle Flat, on a part of the run occupied by Mr D. P. Keogh, J.P.i one of the magistrates who adjudicated on the case. On Wednesday, Mr ©. P. Keogh drove the cattle up tohisstockyurd, for what purpose we donot pre tend to say ; when the Clerk of Petty Sessions, Corowa, went up on Chrisimasi mprning to count the cattle, he only found 174 head; At this We let the matter starid,' reserving our rtiinarks for a future occasion. , Mr Keogh ;was .summoned ;b,e-, fore the bench a' few weeks ago ,f for 'excessive! driving charges, arid was ordered to refund £7 of the money. ; Five shillings' per head on 300 ;cattle,' would be a nice little Christmas ^Bok.' ? ? r . ,. ; Melbourne suffered . on, Wednesday twider'. a! scorching hqf wind, and a stormj or rather hurri-| cane',, of dust, of almost ^unprecedented severity.; . From: an early hour .:. in the:-mpjning. ra fierce; northern wind blew throughout, the, greater part! of the day, with blasts as' from: a furnace of mbltfen' iron; The flushed faces of the wayfarers1 icom-| pelled to encounter ; the , fiery breaih of the, wind,1 and the four-footed creatures trembling .and; paritirig ' ; in the' ' streets ; ' arid \l highw'ays,1 told the - severity of the ^visitation; vi':Many' old.-,, colonists,.'; indeed, -declared \i%r- to,.;- W the moBt oppressive day they, had .ever eipe-| rienced in Victoria; hardly exe'eptirig eVeri1 that terrible day in our annab, f* Black ,Thursday;;'| and this can scarcely be said to be an exaggera tion, seeing that the thermometer measured. 114° \ in the shade. ?' The overpowefirig. heat of ihe'jday waB no doubt aggravated by the extensive ibush fires raging over a wide, expanse of, country over; which the wind blew. About ' three o'clock the; wirid J- changed suddenly ? to: the eastj arid .a dust hurricane aroB'e such as h&s;,heen rarely ?witnessed. The ?air,, was dai;kened with .thick clouds of dust carried withr terrific idj^ce by the galei which carried^braricaes1 of trees, (arid- the timbers of houses; through the air; with, iriipetuous velocity.. Shops, dwelling-hquses, and , all kinds of, habitationsi ; sufiered ahke,1 and wherever it was pbbsible for the dust to: enter Jt did sojleayi ing everything buried beneath deep strata. Be tween five and six o'clock the atmosphere cooled down considerably, and by nightfalli the storm of the day was succeeded by very vivid lightning and far rolling thunder. A few showers fell in the course of the evening,(and the new year was ushered in by a copious fall. ; A wide range of country has been visited foj: the last day or two by bush fires of rare extent and severity. Nearly the whole line of country between Melbourne arid Castlemaine was on Tuesday and Wednesday on fire, . The same may . be said of the country between this and Ballaarat. A traveller by the trairi on Wednesday from the last mentioned town describes the country from the first station on the line out of Ballaarat, down for some distance past Lethbridge, as on^. sea of flame, which in the night ride was of surpassing grandeur. The fire came up to the railway fence, but on one side only — that on the south, or sea side. AB.the train approached Geelong, much apprehension was entertained by some of the passengers that the fire haa extended to some of their homesteads, on the Barrabool Hills; but this, fortunately, on \ a nearer ap-. proach, waa found to be groundless. The heat of the wayside conflagration was described to us ? as intense. Tuesday, at Ballaaratl was a day of fierce heat, and bush fires spread! in all direc tions, There was a very extensiye\conflagration to the north of /Mount Buninyong, Which abated towards the evening. Further to th^ north again the columns of. dark smoke were very numerous, and in the Biowns quarter the skV was quite overcast. Afire raged also on the BlaekYHill, Scars dale : andthe^ush was also on fireontie Dividing Range, between Mr M' Okie's saw Wills and Siny thesdale. A tremendous bush fire alao occurred at Fryers' Creek; A telegram deBoribds the con flagration around Mount Blackwood, and intelli gence of fires of leaser magnitude comes from many other districts. Altogether there is quite enough in these far extended flames to justify the . opinion that the terrible heat, of Wednesday was due, in some' measure, to the up-country bush fires. ^ . ' . \ '; Works descriptive of the interior of Australia are likely to be plentiful enough soon. Ify addi tion to the diaries: of the explorers themselyesj we. are to have historical and descriptive narratives. Dr. Murray, who accompanied Howitt's party, intends publishing a' volume descriptive of' the country trayerseji by the expedition j; and Mr. James Smith has in preparation a work on Austra lian Exploration, which he will get published in England, where, we understand, he intends to proceed in the course of a week or two, Rumor says Mr Smith's' inission to England has also sorriething to do with the Emigration Agency business. .' : .? ?? :.? ? ?;'; ??' ?;??: ?: ; ;.-'?? , - ': ?? ?.!? j ?.- '??'?? At the usual meeting of the Council of the Ac - climatisation Society, held - on Tuesday, preBerit Dr Black, Professor M'Coy, Messrs Godfrey, Wilson. Smith,.

A letter was read from Captairi Godfrey, thanking the Council for their kindness in electiiig him; an honorary mem ber of the Society. The Secretary stated that he had been informed by Mr Sayoe' that the Ligurian bees were doing well, and their ultimate success was confidently anticipated. The superintendent reported that a nest, of Californian quails and a nest of brtolanB had been let off at the Botanic Gardens, and that the sparrows had commenced ' to build and lay in the aviary ; also that two fawns of the fallow deer had been dropped, thus i making a clear increase of seven this season. i The Council acknowledged the receipt of one . kangaroo from Dr Macdonald of Horeham; one ; quail from Mr Chancellor of Hotham ; two Mur , ray turtles from Mr Wilson of Queen street ; and i one crane from Mr Powell of Prohran.

' ? Hurrah for King Death and for our dividends ? Complaints are now becoming rather too fre quent as to the unpunctuality of justices on Police Court benches. An instance is reported in the Geelong Advertiser :—' The business of the Police Court was delayed fully an hour and a half on Monday for want of a magistrate. Sergeant Warren was started off to bt-at up a « volunteer, ii only to adjourn the Court till Mon day, there being two or three rather important ^ oases on the charge sheet. MeBBrs Blair tad. Parker were not to be founds -K^ori*- vsdardf Dennys, and M'Donald.v/Bre'too busy to come, and Warren, had+.trreiurn to the Police Court at ten mmutgs,''t&' eleven o'clock without a justice. Ouji'tfeporter remained at his poBt until close on ^mf-past eleven o'clock, at which time there was ^ no sign of any magistrate being procurable to dis y pooe of the business, and Mr Warren was once more despatched to catch one. It appears he must have been more successful in his last raid, as he succeeded in getting Dr Hope and Mr C. J. Dennys to go up and discharge the sheet. There may be Borne excuse for a little irregularity, during these holiday times, but we think whpn these gentlemen whose duty it is to attend on Stated days, know that they cannot do so, they Bhould see and get some one else to act for the** and not, cause such a fearful waste of pub1? rths., .';'; ao occurred on; Saturday last.'

We heard previous to the meeting ot the usual .sending round of the fiery croJss to summon the laithful followers, to come and do the bidding of tjheir chiefs. The firebrand of clerical interference -^aB, as usual, employed. The O'Keefe and the priest patched up thbir disagreement for the nonce, and joined hands on this occasion, forget ful \that there had ever been a difference of opinion about the misappropriation of moneys collected for the Irish Relief Fund. The tugletoen had all been actively engaged in heating up the quarters of their adhe rents, and while the ordinary public, in their easy indifferent way of attending to public matters, did1 not trouble themselves very much about a meeting, of the Object of which they yet approved, the forme* took the whole affair into their own hands;1 When the conveners of the meeting were driven irom the hall by clamor and threats of violence, the oppositionists had it pretty much their own way. There was no one to fight with 'or to' tread on the tails of their coats, and it waB delightful to listen to the valiant manner in which absent enemies were' belabored.' The adjournedmeehng was not held on Wednesday frem a desire to avoid a possible disturbance, but as we learn from the telegram, a meeting of the Government sympathisers was held in the Market Place, and strong resolutions in favor of the Governor were carried as' amendments by a large majority. Mr O'Shanassy and his friends i have therefore gained little by the Sandhurst rowdyism; i Our Collins street contemporary still makes, some little pretensions to represent1 public opinion in the colony, Its readers were on 31st ult. treated to a viewof the opinions of the Victorian press on the question between the Governor and the, ?ioihistry. Searching the columns of all the' journals, town and country in Victoria, our con temporary has discovered two allies in the broad sheets of the Wangaratta Dispatch and the Gee long Advertiser. The high importance of the firat-named journal as a representative and organ of public opinion cannot of course le disputed.' But it is curious that out Ministerial contempo rary Bhould have condescended to quote as an authority'a journal 'hailing from the ' capital of Bootia.'

The annual New Year's Eve watoh night ser vice/ in connection, with the WesleyBn body, took place on Wednesday in the W esley an Church Lonsdale street. The service commenced shortly, after ten o'clock. This ?- service has; for some generations past been held upon the last night' of the year. . The attendance was notso numerous iaa on former ocensions, but . the unfavorable weather which prevailed during the evening, de^ terred many from being present who might other-, wioe havo attended. . The annual Bernaon, suit able for the occasion, was preached by the Rev. W. L. Bioks; and, during the evening, appropri ate hytns were sung., The. service terminated a few minutes after the commencement' of the new year- . Similar meetings were held in the various churches of the same denomination throughout the oity and suburbs. .- ', | ? ' i ?? ' T= ? 1 ? i ? L t r I, I ?

F. i Usher, Roman Catholic ; Mr. Andrew Forbes, Roman Catholic. , ' 1 The trafficon the Victorian Railwayon Thursday waa very large, and considerably above thl average. There was not such an increase tb Wilhamstown ' as might have been expected from the sports going on : there in the Botanical Gardens, probably on account of the variety of amusements offered elsewhere, which no doubt presented equal attractions to the pleasure- seeker. To Gisborne, however, the number of passengers showed a large increase. On the whole, through out the various lines, the traffic lately, on, account of the reduced fares, has heen more than double what it was formerly. No special trains had to be put on yesterday, though additional carriages had frequently to be added at intervals throughout the day. j r v }K The Melbourne Railway tfompany's station presented|a ver^ busy appearaiwe on Thuisday, in consequence of the many festivities going on near the various stations' of the ^Jne. There was the Brighton Beach, the Horticultural FSte in the Survey Paddock, the German Pic-nic, the Foresteis' F&te; in the Zoological Garden, and Cremorne. The number of passengers booked at the Melbourne Station up to nine o'clock is as follows :— ? To the Beech, 2430 ;, Hawthorne, 2150 : Cremorne, 2030 ; Botanical , Gardens, 1600 ; making a total of 8210. This does not include the traffic to any pf the uiter mcfdiate stations, which it is considered will increase the number to something like 11,000 or 12,000. The passengers booked at the Melbourne station of the Hobson's Bay Railway Company were, up to half past 8 o'clock, a-i follows: — To Sandridge, 3682 ; to St. Kilda, 2933 ; making a total of 6615. On Christmas Day there were up wards of 9000 passengers booked at the same station. ' ^These^numbers are, of- course, en tirely- exclusive of the passengers hooked to Melbourne. Up to a late hour no accidents were reported as having occurred on either of these lines. r i
