INCENDIARISM IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT. [BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.] (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT,) KOROIT, MONDAY. Three men, named Patrick Joyce, Alfred Warburton, and Daniel Downey, were ar- rested at Hawkesdale on Saturday night last; charged with unlawfully and maliciously setting fire to the stations of Messrs. Samuel Baird (Kangatong), Phipps Turnbull (Green- hills), Stewart Bros. (Warrong), and also the property of Patrick Murphy, a selector. It is alleged that the prisoners were the persons who started the bush-fires which were raging in the district during the recent hot weather. Application was made for a detective to be sent down to inquire into the matter, but Senior-constable Gray, of Koroit, obtained sufficient information to enable him to prefer a charge against the prisoners. A remand was applied for and granted, and the pri- soners will be brought up at Belfast Police Court on the 26th inst. Great credit is due to Senior- constable Gray for his prompt action in this matter, and a feeling of intense indignation is manifested by the people here against the culprits. The prisoner Downey was to have stood his trial at Hamilton for horse-stealing, but was detained by the Koroit police on the charge of incen- diarism.
