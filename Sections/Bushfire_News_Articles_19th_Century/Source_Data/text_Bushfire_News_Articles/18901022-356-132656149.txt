WRECK OF THE ALBERTA, -4~-- Filling with Water. FunitaE intelligence from the econe of the wreck of the steamer Alberta, on Butherland Reof, shows that the vessel went ashore at 11 o'clock on Sunday night, the steamer at the time going about 11 knote an hour. The captain was incapacitated from duty owing to sunetroke, and the navigation of the vessel along the intricacies of the reef- bound coeast from Thursday Island was entrusted to a Torres Straits pilot. The weather was hazy on Saturday night, and the coast was en tirely obecured from' view by the dense smoke from the bush-fires which are raging in the Tweed River district. A slight grat ing sound under the vessel was the first intimation that there was any danger to be apprehended, and before the order could be given to stop and reverse the engines, the crash came, and the fine steamship was hope lessly stranded on the jagged reef. Water made fast in the engine-room and holds, and it was only too apparent that her platine on the bottom had been seriously injured. The crew, composed of 86 men, stuck by the vessel as long as there appeared the slightesb hope; but the position becoming one of danger, the boats were got out, manned, and provisioned, and the vessel was abandoned. T'he neas were then making clean breaches over her, and she was rapidly filling with water. All hopes of getting the vessel off appear to be hopeless. She is lying on the extreme edge of the reef. She was yesterday full of water, and the sea was breaking heavily over lier, rendering it exceedingly dificult to go near her. MB. CUHAB.
