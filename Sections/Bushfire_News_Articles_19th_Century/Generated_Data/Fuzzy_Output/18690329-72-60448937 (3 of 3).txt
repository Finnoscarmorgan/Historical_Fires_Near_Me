Everywhere that a log fence of the monster dimensions natural to this part of the country was situated flames were playing, and in most cases giant logs were reduced to a con- dition of warmth which rendered them ugly customers to be within at least a dozen yards of. Fences, where not pulled down or made away with otherwise, acted as conductors to the flames, which ran along them at a terrific speed. Here and there at intervals trees as large even as are to be seen in that home for forest giants, having been fired near the trunk and burnt through, came down with their burning masses of upper branches, crashing so as to be heard easily at the distance of a mile.
