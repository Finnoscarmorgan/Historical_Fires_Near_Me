MISCELLANEOUS.. A VESPER SONNET. TbhVolkt eve is like a waveless stream Celestial. from the rapt horizon'a brlnk ALheotsr cg y with the diiner drink Of temperate ecstasy and dews and dream. The wine warm dusks, that brim the valley, gleam With here and there a lonely casement. Cease The impetuous purples from tho sky ofpeee L?ko God's ooedl In tresnqlity supreme. The encirclian uplands east and west lie clear In their a?rial amber, threaded fine Where bushfires kneaw the bramble thickets With furtive starlet. Through the hush be nign Dne white throat voices till the stars appear SThe bnediction of theo Tought Divine. -C. G. D. Roberta.
