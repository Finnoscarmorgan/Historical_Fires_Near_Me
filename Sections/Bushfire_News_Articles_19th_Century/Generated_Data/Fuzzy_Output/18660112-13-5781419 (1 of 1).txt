olbrook, charged with having been guilty I of insulting behaviour to a constable, was cautioned and discharged. The remainder of the business consisted of small debt sum- monses. The Crooked River Chronicle states that "a terrific thunderstorm passed over the town- ship of Grant on Monday evening. The lightning, although powerful, did no other damage than shatter a large gum tree to pieces near the western boundary of the town. There was a heavy fall of rain, which lasted for about an hour, after the thunder and lightning ceased, and fair weather re- turned." The Crooked River Chronicle remarks that "bush-fires on the mountain ranges are not often attended with serious loss. The one which occurred on the Britannia spur on Sunday morning last was an exception. Before the course of the fire could he arrested, the carpenter's shop and hut near the machine were enveloped in a blaze and con- sumed, with nearly Â£50 worth of tools. A quantity of pine timber on the ground was also consumed, and the workmen residing near the Eldorado and Britannia works had great difficulty in saving their property. The fire continued to rage from spur to spur, until the waters of Jungle Creek put a stop to its progress."
