y to-day's excessive heat. Sydney, January 7. Tlie weather to-day was perceptibly cooler in most parts of the colony, the coast districts receiving the benefit of southerly breezes from the ocean, and thunderstorms blessing the inland districts. Particulars of yesterday's great heat continue to come to hand. Cobar reports that the shade temperature was 120째, whilst Ungarie caps that record with 125째. Some parts of the colony still complain of the extreme heat. Thus Condobolin to-day reports 115째 in the shade. Unfortunately with the fall in the tem- perature there has been no decrease in the number of bush fires in the country. At Termeil three dwellings have been destroyed through the ravages of forest fires, and Mount Victoria is surrounded by burning mountains. At Bombala it took all the efforts of a band of 100 men working in the hot sun and smoke whilst the thermometer registered over 100째 in thee shade to save the town. At Shell Harbor several farms were ravaged, and much fencing was destroyed, the fires being only got in hand when they came to the borders of Lake Illawarra. Bungendore complains of loss of many miles of fencing, and of the main bridge over Deep Creek. Goulburn, Moruya, Rylsto
