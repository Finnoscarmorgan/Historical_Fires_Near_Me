th represents that the weather has been extremely hot and without rain, except tbe smallest showers. The temperature on Tuesday was 112* ia the outside shade, and to-day near 111'. In the afternoon we had a short but violent dust storm from the south, it brought np olouds, but only a few spots of rain fell. From the Lachlan we learn by the Forbes Times of Saturday that during the past week there has been a suc cession of scorching hot days, and almost equally hot nights. The thermometer has stood more frequently over 100 degrees than under it, and a change would be hailed with universal satisfaction. Bush fires have been prevalent, and they have not helped to make matters more bearable. From all parts we hear of a great scarcity of grass and water, but as yet stock keep in good health and fair con dition. Business in the local market oontinues exceed ingly dull, and owners of grass and water think twioe before they add to their list of grass consumers.
