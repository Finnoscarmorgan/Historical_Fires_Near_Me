a speedy and heavy downpour. BUSHFIRES. — Hot days, and the means for adding arti- ficially to the heat, unfortunately come at the same time. Yesterday bush fires were raging with more or less vio- lence from ten in the morning till the afternoon, all along from the Sugarloaf to the Wollombi Range, the greatest body of distant fire seeming to be behind the farther peak of the twin eminence known as the Sugarloaf mountain. Comparatively near to the town, in a direction that will be best indicated by saying that it appeared to be in the bush beyond the hills that flank the Dagworth estate, a very large bush fire was pursuing its destructive way yesterday afternoon; although when we saw the smoke at half past ten from the gaol hill in East Maitland it seemed that a very trifling area was being burnt. But at two o'clock huge volumes of smoke were rolling up over a large expanse of ground, and it was evident that the largest bush fire of the season had its place there. Some small spirals of smoke were as- cending from among the Paterson mountains during the forenoon, but there was in the evening no fire of any con- sequence perceptible in that direction.
