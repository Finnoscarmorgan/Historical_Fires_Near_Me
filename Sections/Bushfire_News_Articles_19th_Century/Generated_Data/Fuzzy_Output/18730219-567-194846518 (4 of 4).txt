 reports of fires have been received, and the extent of the damage may, to some extent, be inferred from the telegraphic reports. We learn that five miles of the line between Portland and Mount Gambier have been burnt down, also two miles of telegraph line between Belfast and Portland, and more than a mile in the neighbourhood of Heywood. The line repairers have managed to fix up in a temporary manner some of these breaks, so as to prevent large districts from being entirely cut off from the communication, but to restore the lines permanently will cost both time and money. Consequent upon these numerous fires, the heat experienced on Saturday and Sunday was greater at Hamil- ton than on any previous occasion this summer. The town was enveloped in smoke, and people were rushing about on horseback and in vehicles, with a view of ascertaining the extent of the threatening danger, and rendering such assistance as lay in their power. It is a source of thankfulness that there is now an agreeable change in the weather, but it is to be feared that many small farmers have been either wholly or partially ruined by the catastrophe.
