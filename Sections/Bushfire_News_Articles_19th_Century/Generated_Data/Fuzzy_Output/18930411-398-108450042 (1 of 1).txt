The remainder was so obstructed that it reached the plain gradually, and would probably not have been able to cause an inundation if the beds of rivers had not also been partly blocked by reeds and other obstructions. By deforesting and clearing the inclines of these plants, intentionally or through bush-fires, the worms and insects ihat kept the ground loose and porous have mostly been killed, the obstruction to the most rapid descent of the water removed, the ground trodden firmly and hard in many areas by heavy stock-what else can be expected than what happened ? that is, the plain being turned into a great pool by the rushing waters meeting with a flat surface, and accu mulating on it, as on a level table.
