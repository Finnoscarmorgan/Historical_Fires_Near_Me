The work of raising hedges, be it remem bered, cannot be commenced on taking pos session of new country; the land must, in any event, be temporarily fenced with posts and rails, or posts and wires, as hitherto; a hedge needs the protection of a fence during the long serieB of years that must elapse before it can perform duty as a fence against stock. Each season it must be trimmed at considerable cost, and, in spite of good management, gaps are nearly sure to appear at intervals. Then hedges, even upon farms, are very liable to be destroyed by bush fires, and as grazing becomes more general, this liability will be likely to increase. It may be, and indeed it is, urged in favour of hedges and belts of plantation, that the grass upon land thereby partially sheltered grows more freely at all seasons of the year; that grain crops grow higher and stronger, and that cattle thrive on less food during the cool season of year. Before any decision can be arrived at with regard to the alleged augmentation in the growth of grasses, it will be necessary to determine whether the nutriment is increased in proportion to the in crease of bulk, or whetherthe
