THE ILLUSTRATED AUSTRALIAN NRW¿-We have received from Messrs, Westcott and Co. a copy of the Jiluttratal Australian ivctw, dated Fobruary 22\. It contains' a number of interesting illustra- tions, tho first page depicturing a ynung lady anxiously... looking out from a balcony on St. Valentino's morning, waiting the arrival of tho postman, who is Been coming up the street with his great bag of dainty and humourous missives on his back.- A full-pape illustration of a disastrous bush- fire in tho Strathbogie lUnges leaves a great deal to the imagination. "Off to tho Squadron," and tho "Men-of-War and Nival Reserve Biat Race, Hobsou'a Bay," occupy tho opposito pago. By far the best illustration in the number is a well executed and artistic engraving entitled " Going to School," and shows a pretty little maiden, with portfolio and basket of books, wending her way to school. Portraits of tho Rev, D. Jones Hamer, Collins street Congregational Church, Melbourne, and Mr. Robt. Murray Smith, the Agent-General for Vic- toria, and a picture of "The Cold Springs, White Terrace, Rotomah
