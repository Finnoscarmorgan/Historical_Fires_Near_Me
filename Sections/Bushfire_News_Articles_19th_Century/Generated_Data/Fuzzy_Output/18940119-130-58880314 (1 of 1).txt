The more country is opened up, freed from green timoer, and improved, the m,:re suscep tible does it become to infeition, and the germs will reach more rapidly the adult filament stage at which the deadly spores are formed. As the germns cannot live save mlen exposed to the air, all bodies and matter which has escaped therefrom should be immediately burned or buried several feet deep; but as the majority of the deaths occur inn the very hot weather, when there is con siderable danger of starting bush-fires, and when the ground is very hard, there is little liketihood of either of these means for limiting. the ares of contamination beie .eamrsored :The proper way toK cope with the disease is by inoculation accompanied by judicious burninigs of tile infected pastures.
