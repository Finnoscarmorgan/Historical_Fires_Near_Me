Mr. John Henry Gregory, farmer and grazier, near Northam, examined by the de- fendant, said he remembered the Mokine fire. When hi- first observed it, it was bearing in the direction of his own homestead, which adjoins the Mokine estate. It came from the direction of the Clackline, the wind at the time blowing due north, and continuing to blow in that direction for about two hours, when it veered suddenly westward, changing the path of the fire eastward. It was one of the most fierce bush fires witness had seen for years ; it must have travelled at the rate of six or seven miles an hour. Witness did did not think,-from what he had heard that the lighting of the bush by the defend- ant would have materially affected the ori- ginal fire, which by that time must have travelled a considerable distance ahead.
