nt, Mr. M'Donald, was buried in the Presbyterian cemetery on 17th. inst. This highly respected family have the sincere sympathy of all in their sad bereave ment. Mr. H. G. Morton, a well-known figure and old and highly respected identity of this district, passed away early in the month. The depression caused by a very drv severe winter, followed by a sudden dry spring, has been removed to a great extent by the welcome showers of the last few days. The outlook was gloomy in the extreme when we came to contemplate the situation seriously. Cattle in low condition, fodder and pasture becoming scarce, and bushfires raging on all sides and destroying what little pasture was left. There is a creamery in full working order on the Berry Estate, and the majority of the farmers are availing themselves of this means of disposing of their milk instead of sending it to more distant depots. It will be a great boon to the district if properly conducted.
