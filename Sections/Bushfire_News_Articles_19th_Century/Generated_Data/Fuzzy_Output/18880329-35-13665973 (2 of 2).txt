d was received by the Mayor of Goulburn, Mr. F. Tait, and Mr. W. R. Riley, and driven to the Commercial Hotel, facing Belmore-square. The Minister called at Binalong, Yass, Fish River, and Breadalbane on the way from Har- den, and inspected the station accommodation at each place. Certain departmental matters of no public importance were also dealt with. Several bush-fires were observed in the hilly country on both sides of the line, between Binalong and Bowning. A fierce fire was raging close to the railway, and fanned by the wind the flames were apparently carry- ing everything before them. A large bushfire was also burning on the hills about a mile from Yass station. Unless rain falls speedily the forest fires will prove exceedingly disastrous in the southern and western districts, as the tall grass is everywhere as dry as tinder, and liable to ignite at any moment, and devastate the country for hundreds of miles. Mr. Sutherland will go over the whole of the rail- way workshops here to-morrow, and receive a deputation at noon. He will probably touch at Mittagong and Picton on Friday, arriving in Sydney the same evening.
