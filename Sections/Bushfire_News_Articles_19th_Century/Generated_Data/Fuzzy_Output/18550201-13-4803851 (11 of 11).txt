inal kindling of these fires, and stain- gent laws have been enacted for the punishment of any one who lights them. But in an extensive country like this, with the whole surface covered throughout the summer with a highly inflammable substance, these fires will occur in spite of all human efforts at prevention. The traveller will leave his camp-fire smouldering, and liable to be blown about by every gust ; the bushman will drop the ashes out of his little black pipe; the aborigine will carry along with him his piece of burning bark ; and it is ridiculous to suppose, that with all these provisions for bush fires, they can be done away with, or prevented from continuing regular peri- odical visitations. The best policy is to provide for any possible contin- gency, by the usual and established safe guards, and to fence each home- stead in from the ravages of this de- structive element, by a timely use of the self-same agency.
