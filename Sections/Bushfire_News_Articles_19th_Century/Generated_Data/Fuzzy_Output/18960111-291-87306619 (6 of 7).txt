Melbourne, January 6. The greater part of the Albions township, including the whole of the United Albions plant and housing, was destroyed by a bush fire, which started between the township and the New Year mine yesterday afternoon. Very great damage was done, Mr. Wright's house with all its contents, Mr. Eustice's boardinghouse, and nine other residences being completely destroyed. Of the United Albions property, only the stack is standing, and the total damage is estimated at £6,000. Several persons were burnt while fighting the flames, but none seriously. There is great excitement locally. Bush fires are reported from all parts of the colony. At Grenville two residences were destroyed and many other buildings had a narrow eseape.
