Bush fires may often be put out with boughs, if the day is calm ; - but the best time to do it effectuallyis by night, - when from the dampness of the herbage ; the progress of the burning is slow. When a fire has been put out, same careful persons should always go along the edge of the burned surface after dark, especially! in forest tracts, to . remove all ignited dead wood, other wise another fire is sure to spring up in the morning We observe in oiir Exhibition a model of a machine for extinguishing bnsh fires. It consists of a cylin der, supported on a frame/and two travelling wheels like those, of a cart. On the circumference of a cylinder are several loosely hanging chains. As the travelling wheels progress, they communicate a rapid progress to the cylinder, the chains being de signed to strike the fire and beat it out. The whole principle is, we think, unsound. A machine of tho kind in a hot day would become a fire distributer, for the stroke of the chain is not downwards, but in a horizontal direction, and when in rapid motion Jjiiey will throw backwards pieces of burning sticks to ignite fr
