at of the weather being very great) occurred on Sunday morning at Brown's Plains. About a fortnight ago, it appears a lightning storm struck some dry timber and set it on fire. The fire was still smouldering, and it is supposed the high wind fanning it burnt the grass into a flame. The fire began in Pope's old paddock, from thence spreading to Mr. Morris's, and onward to Mr. Martin's. Mr. Morris lost upwards of a mile of fencing and an orchard of fruit trees. Mr. Martin also lost fencing and a large quantity of grass. The fire, by the exertions of those engaged, was luckily put out. On Friday, a serious fire occurred at Leseberg's farm, also on Brown's Plains, but it was luckily confined to the one property. The weather was very hot. The fire began in the barn, which was totally destroyed, together with a large quan- tity of wheat and a considerable quantity of new hotel furniture, which was stored there. Leseberg's house (a publichouse) was on fire three times, but by the exertions of those present there was little damage done.
