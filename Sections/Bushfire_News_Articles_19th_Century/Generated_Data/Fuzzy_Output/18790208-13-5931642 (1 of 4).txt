TERRIBLE BUSH FIRE. FIVE LIVES LOST. [BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.] (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) COLAC, FRIDAY. A terrible bushfire broke out yesterday about eight miles south of Colac, and swept down with treat rapidity upon the township. A large number of small selectors inhabiting the borders of the forest have been burnt out, and the fire is still raging, after 21 hours of ineffectual attempts to subdue it. A family named Turnbull, consisting of father mother, and five children, were suddenly surrounded by the flames while upon land belonging to Mr Standley, who was with them. The whole party made for the dam.
