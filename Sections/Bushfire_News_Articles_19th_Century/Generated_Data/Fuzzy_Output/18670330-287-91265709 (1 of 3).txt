 not too great an xiety dinplayed towards preserving long shoots each time, the fence ought, at the end of fourth year, be a most formidable one, and will weli repay all the trouble bestowed upon it. Although some Ame rican growers boast that they can make impervious to even a rabbit or rat, it will be quite satisfactory to our farmers, we presume, if sheep, pigs, and poultry can be kept in their proper places. Perma nence in a fence is one of the most desirable points to obtain, and this quality the Osage orange possesses to an eminent degree. And it will also not only withstand our hot winds, but a bush fire is not so destructive to it as to the evergreen acacia or others possessing essential oils in their composition. A correspondent writes in 1862 from Mooroobark, ' that a bush- fire at Christ mas spread and ignited the dry grass in liis Osage orange fence, and burned the leaves of several plants, which he expected to find destroyed, but that they soon after put forth fresh foliasre, and were growing as vigorously as ever, not evin cing any ill-effects from the accident. The value of the plant for fences is con siderably enhanced by this proof of its po\ver to resist the effect of bush fires.'
