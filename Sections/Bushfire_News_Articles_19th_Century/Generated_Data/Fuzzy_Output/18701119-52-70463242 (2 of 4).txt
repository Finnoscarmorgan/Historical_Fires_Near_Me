lived, with wife and two children, about eight miles to the nort ward. We always thought it would have been bett for bini to move in, but he had put it off, and now t fire had taken us by surprise I rode away, dend-up wind. Our station had a fe largo treoa about fit, and then all was clear plain ar short grass for two milos ; after that came scrub! rangos, in nn open glade of which the Morgans' hi stood. I feared, from tho density of the smoke, thi tho fire had reached them already, but I thought it m duty to go and see, for I might meet them fleeing, an 1 help them with tho children. I had seen many bush-fires, but nover such a one r this. The wind was blowing a hurricane, and, when had ridden about two miles into scrub, high enough t brush my horse's belly, I began to get frightenet Still I persevered, against hope ; tho heat grew moi fearful every moment ; but I reflected that I had ofte ridden up close to a bush-fire, turned when I beean t see the flame through tho smoko, and cantered awa from it easily. Then it struck mo that I had never yet seen a bush firo in such a hurrionno as this Then I remomherc stories of men riding for their lives, and others o burnt horses and men found in tho bush.
