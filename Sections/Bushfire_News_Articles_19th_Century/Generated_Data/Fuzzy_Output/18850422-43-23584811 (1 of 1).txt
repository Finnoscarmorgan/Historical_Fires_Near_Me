s been successfully drained. In the drive to the Meningoort station from Camperdown a large portion of the re- claimed land is passed through, and the value of the work done is at once apparent. Some years ago a vast morass extended right through the property, taking its rise near the Cloven Hills, and continuing its course near to the western boundary of the estaite, where it terminated in a, creek which is one of the tributaries of Black's river (Emu creek). The formidable nature of this morass in the old days may be estimated when it is stated that it was covered with water in the summer, and when bushfires have been rasing in the district the flocks have been driven into this swamp for protection. Drains almost innumerable were cut, and now thousands of sheep and many head of cattle and other stock feed over the once water covered ground. Judicial drainage, un- doubtedly, has been the means of adding greatly to the carrying capacity of the Meningoort property; but other improve- ments are needed to make the erstwhile swamp equal to the carrying powers of the other portions of the estate. The grass with which it is covered is principally of that course, rank description peculiar to swampy count
