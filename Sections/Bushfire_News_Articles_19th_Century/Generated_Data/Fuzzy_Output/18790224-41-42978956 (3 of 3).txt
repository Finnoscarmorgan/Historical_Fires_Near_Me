ted for trial on a charge of wilfully setting fire to their place. After a country fire, at Jamestown, the Jury gave their opinion that the premises burnt — those of Mr. W. T. Tregilgas, bootmaker, were set on fire, and that suspicion pointed to Mr. Tregilgas. The pro perty was insured in two offices ; but up to the present no action has been taken against the suspected incendiary. A destructive fire occurred at Messrs. Tucker's carpenter's shops at Gladstone, on February 12, burning them down, and injuring adjoining property to the extent of a few hundred pounds. There have been some unusually large bush fires during the hot weather. Among the more serious was one which began on January 28, on the run of Mr. S. Davenport, and raged furiously for several days, the area covered by the fire being many miles in extent along tbe Mount Lofty Range. Mr. G. F. Cleland lost £8QO worth of fencing and feed, Mr. J.Cossick, £330 while Mr. Davenport and others suffered to an extent that is not so definitely known, but will at least amount in the agregate to another £1,000.
