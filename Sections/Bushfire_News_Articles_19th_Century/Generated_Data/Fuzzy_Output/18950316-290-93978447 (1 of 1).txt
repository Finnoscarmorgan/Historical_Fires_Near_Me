 obstacles to the free use of existing fences for telephonic purposes have been removed, provided that private business only is transacted and that permission to cross public roads is asked beforehand. Then improve ments in the 'system' — if so itcan becalled — have been suggested. Mr. Fosberry, of Wagga Wagga, has invented a simple and cheap insu lator which can be applied readily to the ordinary wire fence. Without such insulation com munication in wet weather is an impossibility, the electricity flowing off along the damp posts. Another invention of Mr. Fosberry is an ingenious device for locating bush-fires, thunderstorms, &c.; This he does in the fol lowing way : — At each end of the wire-fence telephone is a dial set of the cardinal points of the compass, with the degrees marked off, and a pointer swinging over it. A map or plan of the locality, correspondingly marked, is kept at each station or hut, and the bearings of the smoke, say, having been carefully taken at both places, the results are intercommuni cated and the position of the fire pricked off on the maps. With the apparatus of Mr. Fos berry this can be done without expert know ledge ; and as ordinarily the loss of time in locating
