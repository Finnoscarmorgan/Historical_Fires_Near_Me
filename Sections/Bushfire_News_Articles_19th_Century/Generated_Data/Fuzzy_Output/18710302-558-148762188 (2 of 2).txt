 dry and the day was hot. The splitters' camp was approached to within three miles by the wanderers, and then they imagined that the splitters had shifted, and retraced their steps riverward. The agonies of thirst coming on them O'Neal yielded first â€”his strength failed him, though a bale man apparently forty years of age. He lay down under a shady tree, and his mate, who was fast sinking, in compliance with his request, hoisted his blanket as a signal of distress. This done, O'Neal insisted that his mate should save himself. The mate staggered onwards, and coming on the Gideron road (an unfrequented bush track) he lay down to die, but that day came the only dray that had travelled it for months, and the poor thirst-stricken wayfarer was just saved from the jaws of death. Infor mation and search followed, but it resulted only in the finding of O'Neal's dead body.
