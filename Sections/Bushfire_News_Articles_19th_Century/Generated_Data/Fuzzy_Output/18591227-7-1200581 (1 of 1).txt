GUICHEN BAY. {From our own Correspondent.} The wool season is now well advanced, and the drays are arriving very quick from the country. The Peregrine Oliver has over 1,000 bales on hoard, and is expected to be loaded by the end of the present month. The Ant had a gale of wind against her on lier pas- sage down this time, and did not arrive until 5 o'clock bn Thursday afternoon ; she had also to con- tend against a heavy head sea. . Several large bush-fires have been observed lately, but I have not heard of any damage done. Several horses ave in training here for the races next month, and it is expected that the entries will be more numerous thau those of any previous year, and the sport better.
