lu'JOL' i.'D sI I;E. ,--4--- (FROM Orr OWN CORRESPONDENT.) S;. I:February;17.' 4e have had a most welcome change e the weather and plenty of rain. .ihe prospects of any grass for 'the winter were looking rather small, and it is even now doubtful whether the rain has come soon enough, for the grass was fairly dried to the roots. The water supply, however, which was getting very short, has been replenished and is not likely, to become low again. The rain has also had the effect of extinguishing the numerous bushfires which were raging.- The bushfires have- caused considerable damage to fencing, and some split timber lying in the bush hais been destroyed. None of the promises of the Railway Commissioners show any sign of being carried out yet, but I suppose they have not yet had time to properly con sider the matter. A contract has, however, been let for a cooling shed at the station, but that was decided upon previously. A new station would be of much greater service, for in wet weather the present accommodation is execrable. If it is raiuing much pas sengers will get wet while buying their tickets. Ther
