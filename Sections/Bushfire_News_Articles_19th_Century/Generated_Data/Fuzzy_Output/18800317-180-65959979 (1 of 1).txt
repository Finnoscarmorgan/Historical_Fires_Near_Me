fternoon the hail fell in size of a marble, flat like a bean. About five o'clock another storm, still heavier, broke, the hail resembling in shape crosses, stars, and balls, in size varying from a cricket-ball to a foot-balL When these latter reached the ground they fell to pieces like lime stone. Some of the pieces weighed half a pound to a pound, and did not melt for a longtime. The children picked them up in buckets and in earthern jugs, and when they melted the water can through the jugs as if they were sieves. During the storm the lightning and thunder were terrific. Thank goodness, the heat and bush- fires were entirely dissipated by this welcome yet awful storm.
