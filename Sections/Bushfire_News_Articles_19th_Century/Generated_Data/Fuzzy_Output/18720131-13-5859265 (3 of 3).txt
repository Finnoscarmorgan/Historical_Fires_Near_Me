By enclosing each station within a fire impossible boundary line, and by dividing the whole area into a few compartments, local fires might occur, but a total loss of 1 pasture would never be experienced. To ac- complish this result is the object of the simple apparatus I invented four years ago, and submitted to a rude but satisfactory trial at Glengower with one I made ia a day, of galvanised iron. I shortly afterwards offered it to the squatting interest, without expecting foo or reward, but got no response. Since then tens of thousands of pounds have been lost by bush-fires, which I believe might have been prevented to a great extent by the use of my invention, which I beg to describe in the columns of The Argus, whilst I submit a model for inspection at Scott's Hotel, Collins street. A frame of light angle-iron, Gft, long and 3ft. wido, ia placed on four light wheels, 18m. in diameter. Resting on the framo at the hinder part of it is a fire-grate, almost touch- ing the ground, but consequently made moveable on a joint in front, so as to rise over any unevennesB of the ground or obstructions on the surface, and sink again into its position when the obstruction
