. The scholars seem to be progres- sing favourably under the care of Miss Mary E. Gegg. We are very short of school furniture, however, clock, etc., which we hope will be soon provided. Mr. Cheesewright and Mr. H. Angove passed through here last week on their way to Albany, inspecting the line and taking a series of sketches. They took several scenes of homesteads and build- ings here. Mr. Angove's party are bor- ing for water on the line and are expect- ed to reach this in five or six weeks. We have had a few thunderstorms which have not put much water in the pools, but have stopped some troublesome bushfires. The weather is very change- able ; excessive heat and coolness alter- nating. In sporting there is, I hear, a cricket match with Kojonup in prospect. We have two horses also in training for the Albany races,-Mr. Lott's Belle Mahone and Mr. A. Nelson's Fanny-but as for their prospects of winning, I cannot say anything certain.
