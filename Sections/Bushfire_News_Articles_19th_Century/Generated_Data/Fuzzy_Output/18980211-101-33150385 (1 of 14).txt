VICTORIA. MELBOURNE, February 3. The weather continues dreadfully oppressive, and there are no present pros- pects of a change. The heat during the day was intense and muggy, with north to north easterly winds, but each night since Friday the air has been stifling in its oppressive warmth and stillness. The Government Astronomer states that were it not for the heavy clouds of smoke from the bush fires overhanging the city the heat would be far mere oppressive. Smoke from the fires continues to para- lyse shipping on the coast between Cape Otway and Wilson's Promontory, the en- tire stretch of coast-line being wrapped in dense obscurity. This has been the case for the past four days, rendering the generous use of fog signals from the light- houses necessary to warn ships of danger. From the Cape Otway station alone 900 rockets have been fired during the last four days, or equal to 18 months' consump- tion under ordinary circumstances.
