y and Mr Meyer, and voting went on wih spirit till the hour of closing, when the result was--for Mr. Icely 27 votes, Mr. Meyer 56 votes. From conversations I have had since Monday with several parties I learn that a great many of Mr. Icely's supporters, leading gentlemen of the district, mistook the daly; otherwise, from the number of votes they would have recorded, would no doubt have pIaced Mr. Icely in the majority. On Tuesday Iast the races at Mr. John McKenzie's went off very agreeably. On Tuesday evening we were visited by a very severe thunderstorm. A tree was splintered by the electric fluid. Bush-fires of great extent almost surround us. 30th December, 1874.
