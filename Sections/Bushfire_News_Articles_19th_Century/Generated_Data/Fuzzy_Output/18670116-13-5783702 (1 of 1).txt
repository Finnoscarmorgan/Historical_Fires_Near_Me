es. , Happily the intolerably hot weather laWJ experienced' hiö'ßiveii way, and colder vruw and rain have succeeded. On Monday even- ing, the heat culminated in a thunderstorm of remarkable intensity. It was accompanied hy a few drops of rain only, and by little wind. At án early hour yesterday morning the wind set in from the south-west, blowing smartly, while tho clouds accumulated por- tentously ; the rain commenced early in the day, and some very heavy showers fell. The gardens had been so severely scorched by tho extraordinary heat of the sun that this heavy rain has come just in time. On Monday bush fires were reported in all quarters. It is to be hoped, however, that the rain has been of assistance to the farmers and squatters in staying the ravages of the fire. Amongst the articles of interest in the Exhi- bition which have escaped notice are some fine mincralogical specimens contributed by Mr. E, J. Dunne. They were collected by the exhibitor in the Beechworth district, and in- clude samples of tin ore, black sand, auri- ferous quartz, and precious- stones. The most noticeable of the latter are the topazes and diamonds ; but the collection contains many other objects of interest. Visitors
