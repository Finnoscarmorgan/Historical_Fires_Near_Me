It was probable that he had lit the fire to cook the meat he .had purchased; and his reason for avoiding the other men was possibly because he had been, told that he was not a good workman, it was much to be regretted that such considerable loss had been occasioned by the man's carelessness, but he did not think there was any evidence of his having wilfully caused the fire. "Were the ,Bush Fires Act more stringent there would perhaps be fewer fires, it had been hinted that the police were not forward in giving assistance at bush"fires, but the trooper's evidence showed that, at least in this instance they had rendered assistance as promptly as possible. He had also seen the police working viery hard'at'fires'. The jury returned the following verdict:â€”"That the fire which started in Horsnell's Gully on the afternoon of Tuesday, January 20, was caused by a stranger who was working for Messrs. Wrafter and Amner in the quarry by great carelessness consequent on his neglect."
