Nearly the whole of the country between the Pyrenees and Ballarat presents evidence of a large conflagration having swept over it, and the amount of loss occasioned must in the ag- gregate reach a very high figure. On Wednes- day evening, when the fire was at its height, a slight change of wind occurred, and the ur- rounding view was one of the most extraordi- nary we ever witnessed. What with the density of the atmosphere, the clouds of dust, and the long line of smoke arising from the bushfires and amalgamating with the mist, the country around appeared to be enveloped in a dense fog. At White Horse Reef, Amherst, and about the diggings thereabouts, several tents were des- troyed by the fire at this time, and the flames spreading through the fog which prevailed, gave a most unearthly and ghastly aspect to the whole view.â€” Talbot, Leader.
