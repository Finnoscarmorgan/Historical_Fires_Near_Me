 also valued at about Â£20. After causing all this damage the fire seemed to have bant itself oat in this direc tion. When dsrkneEs set in there was every in dkation of rain, and the gathering of the dark clouds was watched with great anxiety by the settlers in the district. Fortu nately for all interested, at about 8 o'clock a cool breeze sprang np, and was succeeded by a light falling of dew and then by a gentle shower of rain. The slight fall of water bad the desired effect, as it soon put an end to all burning bushes. At 1L30 the fire was virtually over ; what remained of cce of the most extensive bush fires in this part merely consisting of a few stumps of trees and some thick dead wood. Too ninth praise cannot be bestowed on the members of the mounted-police force, who were present at the fire, for their sp!endid behaviour. The whole of the little force worked with great willingness, and during a portion of Monday they had to labor in a space almost surrounded by fire. The men in the employ of Mr. T. Burnett, builder, turned out, and -later in the after noon a number of navvies employed at the seventeen-mile camp left their work and lent assistance to beat back the flames.
