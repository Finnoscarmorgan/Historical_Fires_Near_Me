AND. Councillor M'PHERSON moved the adoption of a recommendation of the report of the Health Committee, that the town clerk be instructed to communicate with the hon. the Commissioner of Railways, requesting that the railway land on the eastward of the Vic- torian Railway, parallel with Adderley-street, may be drained. Councillor FENWICK seconded the motion, which was carried. The remaining business having been post- poned, the council adjourned. The battery and plant of the Victoria Com- pany, Crooked River, together with the huts, buildings of all kinds, tramway, &c.;, were destroyed last week by a bush fire. The plant was worth several thousands of pounds. The heat was so excessive as to melt the soft joints of the engine, which was much damaged.
