he Com mittee was that of insuring fences against losses by fire. They have resolved to write to the Melbourne officers to make a sugges tion as to the rate of premium they are dis posed to accept for risks of this natnre. This is a very important matter, and before it is disposed of by the insurance companies, we should like to be heard on the side of the intending insurers. The nature of the fire risk to squatters' fences is, like most other risks, twofoldâ€”namely, by accident and by design; but in this case there is too much reason to believe that intentional burning is most to be feared. Of course bush-fires occur through accidental causes, and fences are in consequence consumed; but in nine \- cases out of ten, wherein a squatter's bounda ries are destroyed, the work is traceable to tho vindictiveness of disappointed tramps or discharged servants. It is, perhaps, a shock ing thing to say ; but it is true, nevertheless, that more fences are Burned with malice prepense than are destroyed by accidental fires. Now, the Insurance Companies, by accepting these risks, would in great measure reduce tliem, inasmuch as the motive of the incendiary would be ;baulked by the know ledge that the burning of
