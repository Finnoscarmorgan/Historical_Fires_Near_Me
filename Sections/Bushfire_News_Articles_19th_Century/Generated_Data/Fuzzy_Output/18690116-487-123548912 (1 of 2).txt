UPPER ADELONG. (from our correspondent.) January 8th. â€” Bush-fires are now raging in almost every direction and have done consi- derable damage. Mr. A. Watson o,f this place, and Mr. J. Callaway, of Reedy Flat, have had a great portion of their fencing destroyed, and the grass for miles around has been consumed. It is presumed that fires have been wantonly lighted in various directions to prevent owners of sheep from bringing them hither. Assuming this to be the case, the incendiaries will themselves be great sufferers, as the only food for cattle, &c.;, is now com- pletely destroyed, and must necessarily occasion an advance in the price of butcher's meat,
