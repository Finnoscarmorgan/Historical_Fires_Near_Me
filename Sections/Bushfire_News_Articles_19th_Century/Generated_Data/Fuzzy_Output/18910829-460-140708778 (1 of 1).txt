ets, is ' shown. The iield sprayers, which will noj rtoubt interest farmers, commands attention. This arrangement is the idea and design of Mr. Pearson, the Government agricultural chemist, and lias been fitted up by John Danks and Son Limited. The spray ing arrangement is connected with a pump, driven from one of the wheels of a cart, on which is carried a tank containing the necessary solution, and consists of two long arms 20ft. long, which are fitted witli a num ber of sprayers. It will be easily seen that in spraying fields at the rate of 40ft. each journey a very large area is soon covered. The bush-fire pump is quite a handy and sightly affair. A low tank holding 200gal. is placed upon a light cart frame, the whole of which is made of iron. By an ingenious arrangement one of the wheels is con nected with a pump, sc that as the cart moves along a steady stream' of- water is delivered from the nozzle of the hose. The pump is so fixed that by simply pulling a lever the driving gear is disconnected, and ! the puÂ»ip can be used for filling the tank from pny stream or dam. llvtlraulic rams are shown in all sizes. These machines should be more used throughout the colony than they are at pre sent.
