osphere was most oppressive and un breathablo. There is no doubt that considerable damage has resulted from these fires. Since the above was written we havo heard that about eighteen homesteads, lying between the mount and the Junction, havo been totally destroyed. Mr Dainty aud Mr 'White have been considerable losers by the fire, nnd it is reported that the child of Mr Thomas was burned in the flames. A valuablo racehorse was also killed. Wo give these additional particulars exactly a3 they reached us at a late hour last night.— M. A. Mail, February 28. NEWSTEAD. Newstead was yesterday surrounded by bush fires, and many of the inhabitants are apprehensive for the safety of tho town. As a girl was washing in Marsden's yard, sparks from a fire lighted outside flew on to a dry dung heap, the straw immediately ignited, and hnd it not been for the strenuous exer tions of a score of men, several of the houses would most probably have beon consumed. The bush fire on the rango near the Bridge Inn was, at three o'clock, towering yards high. Some horses, startled by tho blaze and smoke, broko away, and tho resi dents were in a state of excitement and dread. — M. A. Mail, February 28. MOUNT MORIAC. Moant Mb
