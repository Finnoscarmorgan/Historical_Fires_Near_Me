AFFAIRS IN THE BUNGAREE DISTRICT. FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT. Sunday was the hottest and moat disagree able day experienced here for many years. A hurricane-hike wind blew from the north during the whole day, which brought up dense clouds of dust. Towards evening the atmos phere became thick with smoka from bush fires in the forest. No reflection of fires could be seen in any direction during the evening or after nightfall. It is reported to-day that several tons of splittersâ€™ firewood caught fire in iho Eorweinguboora forest and were totally destroyed. The thermometer in the shade during the afternoon registered 98 5 degrees. The high winds that prevailed yesterday afternoon had the effect of blowing down a large quantity of the hay stacks in the fields, but this mishap will only take a little time to remedy, the corn not being damaged owing to the absence of rain. In the Navigators district water is very scarce. Many of the farmers have to drive their cattle long distances to water.
