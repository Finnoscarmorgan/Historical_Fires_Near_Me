 wrote agniu. Since my last letter we have been on our annual holidays and wo spent part of our time in Melbourne near the Red Rluff and not far from the two sailors’ graves, I saw mentioned in one of your little friend’s letters. Wo spent the remainder of our time in Gippsland, Ncerim South, and the scenery is beautiful. The lovely hills are so steep and the valleys are full of ferns which grow to a great height, and creepers of every description twine around the trunks. We drove from our friend’s house to Neerira, about five miles and saw an immense tree, the centre of which has been burnt out by a bush-fire, and the hollow is so largo that if the open ing wore big enough one could drive the phaeton aud ponies in easily. I am sorry to say my little sister’s sightisnot improving. She is under Dr. Jackson, of Melbourne, and has to go down once a month. To make matters worse she is just recovering from searlet fever. I went to the jubilee treat and enjoyed myself very much. There were great paius taken to make the day enjoyable for the children. I think my letter is long enough, so with best love, I remain, yoqr little friend, Daisy Hughes, aged 11 years.” “Tragowel, June 28. “ Dear ‘ Red Riding Ho
