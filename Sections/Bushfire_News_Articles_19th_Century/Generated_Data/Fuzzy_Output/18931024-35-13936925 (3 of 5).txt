For that we may be grateful, but it would not be amiss to look rather beyond the immediate occasion for gratitude and con- sider the possibilities of the near future. It already seems likely that the season before the country will be found exacting. Though early, the summer begins to be hot and dry. What this means is that in a short time we may have every condition conducive to damage through bush fires.
