 good wide belt of land burnt over around them. This should be done on a perfectly calm day, and with plenty of attendants to keep the fire from spreading too rapidly. It is easily beaten out with a green bough while kept under proper control, but many of the disasters of Black Thursday arose from the flames getting the upper hand which were origi- nally kindled as a safeguard. There is a very stringent act directing due notice to be given to neighbours when this pre- caution is to be adopted. But after the warnings which have been given, and with the horizon even now daily lighted up by the glare of bush-fires, no sane man who has property to guard will delay the most vigorous measures of pre- caution. The circle of safety should be quite complete, so as entirely to isolate the property to be secured ; it should be very wide, so as to guard against the conse- quences of great heat and a high wind : it should be formed during a calm day, and with ample assistance at disposal. We trust that our up-country brethren will aid us in averting serious disaster by echoing our warnings. There is not a day to spare.
