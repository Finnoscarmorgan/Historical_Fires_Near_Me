 to us. Suerrso.-We direct attention to the appearance of Professor Wyman in the Gawler street Rink to-night, when he will be assisted by the accomplished lady skater Miss Roberts, as also Master Ajax. Vanous novelties are promised. On Wednesday the Professor's second appearance at the New Orderly Room was hailed by a large audience. â€¢ Again some clever trick skating was introduced, including skating on the head, jumping over chairs with skates on, &c.; The applause was again frequent, and those who have not seen the Professor should not allow the opportunity to pass.
