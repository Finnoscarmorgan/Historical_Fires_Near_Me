. We trust such egregious errors will be at once noticed and rectified at the coming collection of the roll, in February next. The election is now in statu quo, awaiting the appointment of a returning officer, which we hope will take place immediately-there being several gentlemen in the neighbourhood quite ready and com- petent to undertake the duties so satisfactorily performed hitherto byMr. Dangar. The report lately in circulation that the residence of L. P. Doyle, Esq., of Killarney Plains, was stuck-up by bushrangers, is, we are glad to hear, without foundation. The weather is now very hot, and bush-fires are fre- quently noticed. We have just been told of a large sheep station, huts, yards, &c.;, &c; , the property of W. C. Slyman, Esq., being lately totally destroyed by one of them; and should strongly recommend all persons having properties unprotected to burn all the grass for a short distance around its immediate vicinity. Wee Waa, Dec. 4, 1864.
