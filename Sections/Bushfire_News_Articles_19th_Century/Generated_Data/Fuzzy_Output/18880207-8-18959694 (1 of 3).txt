 bank of the creek, where they were found, during recent floods. At this stage the inquiry was adjourned for a fortnight to enable the police to obtain further information, if possible, to lead to the identification of the remains. THE RECENT FIRE.-The police have arrested an aboriginal named William Saunders on suspicion of having set fire to Messrs. Gould and King's saw- mill on Sunday morning last. The prisoner will be brought up at the police court on Tuesday next. THE WEATHER.-Hot and muggy weather has now prevailed for several days. Appearances denote that we are on the eve of a heavy rainfall. BUSH FIRES.-An extensive bush fire has been burning for the last two days towards Dochra and Rothbury. Should the dry weather continue doubt- less more bushfires will follow, as the long dry grass in the ringbarked country especially offers every encouragement for the rapid spread of fires. Singleton, 4th Feb., 1888.
