have had their flour ground or a bag of flour sent to them when they most wanted It, and no charge made, When a disastrous bush-fire ruined half the people on the creek a few years ago, Mr. Hutcheson was the first to move in getting up subscriptions in their aid, and we are justified in saying that when the committee left the distribution of the funds to him, all were satisfied. Mr Hutcheson was a very retiring man; he loved the hum of his mill more than the bustle of the town, and although he was one of the first mem- bers, of the Dundas Road Board, he soon retired, and never again took office, although frequently solicited to do so. He was a fine mechanic, and could make anything in wood or metal, the old Hamilton Mill remaining a monument of his skill in that direction. Mr. Hutcheson was twice married - firstly to a sister of Mr. Geo. Robertson, of Warrock, who died child- less, and secondly to his widow, by whom he leaves a family of four sons and one daughter.
