vation of our forests, since the removal of piles (saplings), both in the felling, and subsequently in their haulage to port, is so destructive of growing timber. But the mischief does not atop here. It is a very common practice on the part of hewers to discard a sapling as worthless — perhaps too unsound to risk its chance of passing the contractor. 'The tree Iteth where it falls' is realised here ; but it does something more. In the process of decay, its branches rendered highly inflam mable, this mass of debris is just the thing if not to start, at least to feed, a bushfire. Most of us know what a bnshfire in a jarrah forest means ; but there are not so many who, in looking into the future, have reflected upon the immense destruction of young timber trees by fires — not that in all cases they are killed outright by the names. but the sharp scorching by the undergrowth is generally found to be bo effectual that the tree seldom regains its former vigour. Therefore, in a word, I think we might seriously consider whether it would not be as well to abolish the pile trade altogether ; to make it penal to cut jarrah for any purposes below a given girth ; and, lastly, to make it compulsory upon sawyers
