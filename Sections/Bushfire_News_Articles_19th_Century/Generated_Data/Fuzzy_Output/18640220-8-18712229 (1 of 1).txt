n the interval the sergeant found where prisoner had disposed of the bridle. Remanded till this day for the evidence of Knight's son, when prisoner still adhered to the old story, but acknowledged to finding the bridle on the road, and spoke largely of his character since being in tho colony near forty years. Pri- soner, who appears to bo about sixty, elected to be dealt with summarily, and was sentenced one month to Maitland gaol. The late rain has done a deal of good here. Everybody appears thankful for what we have had, as it will secure a plentiful supply of grass for the winter. We hear the late bush-fires made great havoc. Our main creek has not been moro than half bank high, though that was suf- ficient to delay several travellers, through the want of a bridge at Stockyard Creek. Tho distriot is still in want of a medical man, but as yot I hoar of no sickness ; but should au accident happen the want will bo sorely felt. Feb. 13.
