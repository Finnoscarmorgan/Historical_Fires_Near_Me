PASTORAL AND AGRICULTURAL.—Reports from all parts of the district continue satisfactory. The unusual luxuriance of the pastures of course tends to increase the risk of danger from bushfires, and damage from this cause has been occasioned in various places, though happily not to so large an extent as in the recent conflagrations down the river. The harvest reports show a yield considerably over the average, and it is estimated that the total output will be over 300,000 bushels.
