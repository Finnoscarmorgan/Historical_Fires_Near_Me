TERRIBLE BUSH FIRES. On Wednesday last a bush' fire, which speedily assumed extensive proportions, broke out near Stratford, in the Taranaki province, N.-Z. A telegram - said : â€” The whole country is covered- with dense smoke, which envelopes everything, obstructing the view for more than a few yards in any -direction. From the en trance to the bush at Normanby, some ten miles from Stratford, all along the railway line there is nothing I left but smouldering fires, which need but a puff of wind to fan them into flames, and work farther destruction. (-Sourly burned-out families arrive telling -of more disaster.
