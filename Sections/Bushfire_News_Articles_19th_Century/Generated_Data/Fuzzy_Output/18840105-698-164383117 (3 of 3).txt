night, and week after week, without any polar variation, the mischief done is very great. Not only is the heat intense, with no chance of any thunderstorm, but isolated bush fires, spring up, and, spreading east and west, as well as driven southerly, they, in course of time, if the northerly blasts continue, gradually unite ia one vast body of fire, 20 miles or more in frontage in place of only a few hundred yards, and then a degree of heat is engendered which, borne before the northerly blast, is enabled to. overleap all ordinary barriers, suoh as rivers and clear spaces, that would stop an ordinary bush, fire ; and a destruction of property takes place and a stifling heat is evolved which is never paralleled in any usual state of the weather, and where thermometers cease to mark even the heat ' in the shade ' (so called). A break came in Brisbane on Christmas Eve, when the polar wind beat back the equatorial at last, after an innings by the latter that has not been equalled at midsummer since 1850-51, when half the colony of Yictoria was swept by fire, and the burnt leaves and Bmoke clouds travelled, on 6th February, 1851, across Bass's Straits with the aid of a real old-fashioned equatorial gal
