s a day at the Court House, winch must have been a heavy tax on a man who hod come out for a holiday to regain his health. He takes with him the Rood wishes of all. and had times been more prosperous the people of Melrose would probably have given him a farewell dinner or some other public acknowledgment of esteem before his departure; but in the present state of affairs no ions has spirit to start any such movement. I have been informed that Mr. Tolmer, jun., has been appointed Crown Lands Ranger of this district, in the room of Mr. McKliister. The summer has now fairly set in with intense heat, and bushfires are already prevalent. Small fires have occurred on the Jiartygunia and Wirrab bara Runs, and for tbe last two or three days there has been every appearance of large conflagrations on Crystal Brook, Booyoolee, Bundaleer, and Ca nowie. Last night there seemed to be signs of fire in the neighbourhood of Baroota.
