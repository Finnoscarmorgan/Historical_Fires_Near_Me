About five or six days ago, in -consequence of the bush taking fire, Clarke's Sow-mills were burned to the ground, nothing being left but the ironwork connected with the machin ery. On Thursday, the hush near Brown's Saw-mills also took fire, and the mills were burned down, though luckily the machinery was removed ont of danger before tho flames reached the place. Both these fires have been continuing, and yesterday (Fri <lay),the whole of the bush near MountWarron help seemed blazing away at a fearful rate. Ho less than seven fires could be seen and at night the flames wero distinctly visible from high gronnd. We have not heard the preoise amount of the damage done, but it must be very considerable.-Star. NEWSPAPEB LlTERATtTBB IN IHH WEST.
