ROUSE HILL. A succession of thunderstorms pissed here during Saturday and Sunday, and were generally accompanied by vivid ligttciug and very heavy rain. I have not beard of any damage done in this district as yet. A great many of the creeks and ponds around are filled. The bush and herbage are also rap:dly resuming a more pleasing aspect; but they have of late presented a very gloomy appearance through the ravages of the recent bush-fires. Our orchards are also looking splendii, and we may anticipate a very good summer crop. Even the earlier kinds of fruit, euch as nectarines, apricots, plums, etc., stem to be greatly benefited by the welcome rain.
