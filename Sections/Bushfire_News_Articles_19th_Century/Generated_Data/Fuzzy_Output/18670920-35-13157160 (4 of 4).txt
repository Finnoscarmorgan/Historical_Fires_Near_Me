ich their fore- fathers must have occupied before they were driven by the stronger, intelligent, and lighter races of Protonesia to take refuge in the northern parts of this continent - spreading thence over an almost unlimited extent of territory, wvhere it has for centuries been difficult for them to maintain their individual existence. With a poor, inexpressive jargon, out of which almost everything has been stoned or forgotten - except means for the necessary interchange of a very low stock of ideas - natives like Macomo and Eumerella are, to say the least of it, wholly ideal. The realisation of such fidelity as was displayed by Jackey Jaekey (who was with poor Kennedy in his dying moments) is not beyond the ordinary capacity of that ill-fated race, but the character of the great Chief of the Maroo, in " Fifty Years Ago," is certainly more that of the Red man of J. FeniMore Cooper, than that of the Black Man of Australia. Notwithstanding this material defect, the book is very readable one, such as may fairly claim for itself a place on our bookshelves for Fifty Years to Come. We have, therefore, great pleasure in recommending it to our readers.
