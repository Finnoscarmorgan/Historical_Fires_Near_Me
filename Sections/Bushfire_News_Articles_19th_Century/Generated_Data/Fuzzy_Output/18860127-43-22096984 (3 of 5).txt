ft to cover us, in answer to my prayer. It was too hot to go into the house, and I stayed under the blackwood tree, and the wind changed, and the drenching rain came and doused the fire. If the rain had not come, there is no knowing where the fire would have stopped." The rain which will be remembered as one of the greatest downpours ever ex- perienced in the colony, did indeed save the forest selectors from annihilation. It came just when the fire was at its height, when the trees were crashing to the ground in all directions, and when the fire, not merely scorching and singeing the bark of trees as bush fires usually do, was consum- ing thousands of huge boles of charcoal, and the ground, as can still be seen, was at white heat, like a smelter's crucible. The mournfulness of the gaunt, weird scene which the fire has left is peculiarly striking and depressing. Such a mingling of night and day as the sunlight lighting the pitchy blackness of the landscape, as far as the eye can reach, is indescribably grotesque and desolate. It is hard to conceive anything like this contrast of the sunshine sparkling brightly upon the wide inky, silent waste. It is almost like a smile upon a ghastly death's-head.
