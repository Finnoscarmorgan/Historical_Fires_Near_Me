Dalby. Duahfires (says the Dalby Herald) are raging in all directions around Dalby. and at night the sky Is illumined hy a lurid light, whilst in daytime clonds of smoke obscure the horizon. We hear that the fire extends from Jimbour paddocks to Eumkillenbar, and tfocatty's Corner. At Loudoun station the grass caught fire too, and, we learn with regret, that the grass in. some of the best paddocks was destroyed. Humours are also afloat of miles of fencing being burnt, and that at Marnhull some hundreds of sheep shared the same fate, hut these rumours require confirmation. At any rate the country looks a waste
