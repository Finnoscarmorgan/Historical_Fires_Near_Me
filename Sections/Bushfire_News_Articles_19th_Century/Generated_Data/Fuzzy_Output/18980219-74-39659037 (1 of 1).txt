DAMAGE AT ROSEVEAR'S. ROSEVEAR'S, Thursday. Bush fires were observed on Goetze's, Plummer's, and Hunt's runs on Tuesday, and were fairly burned out, when the strong wind of to-day aroused the smouldering embers, and the fire is again burning actively. Many willing hands have been assisting Mr. Hunt to- day, although I am afraid little could be done against such fierce flames. I cannot ascertain the extent of the damages, but am sure Mr. Hunt will be a heavy loser.
