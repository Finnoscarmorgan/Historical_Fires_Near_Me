(under the oare of Dr. Smith) progressing, eatisfaftÂ» torlly. - i Distruction of Sandy Cheek Bridge.-We leant from a reliable source that the pile bridge over Sandy Creek, on the Casino Road, about nine miles from Myrtle Creek, has been almost entirely destroyed by fire, with the exception of about one span. Upon it being ascer tained that the bridge was on fire, some persons, whose names we have not learnt, proceeded to the spot in the hope of saving it, but only succeeded, after considerable exertion, in saving the small portion that now remains standing. The fire is supposed to have been caused by bushfire igniting an accumulation of drift-wood, lying alongside the bridge. Our informant states that the greater part of the country between Grafton and Casino has been burnt, and that a small culvert between the Travellers' Rest and Myall Creek, has also been destroyed. The destruction of the Sandy Creek bridge will cause a considerable impediment to tbe passage of wheeled vehi- cles along the Casino Road, and as a mail coach is to commence running between Lawrence and Casino on the 1st Januaary next, it behoves the Government to take im- mediate steps for the replacement of this bridge.
