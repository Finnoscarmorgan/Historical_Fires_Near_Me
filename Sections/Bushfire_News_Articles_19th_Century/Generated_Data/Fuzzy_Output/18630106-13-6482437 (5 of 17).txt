ed at Â£150; for not only is his grass destroyed, but a small house in the paddock, and some fifty tons of split firewood, together with all the fences, have been totally de- stroyed. Between seven and eight o'clock the fire spread a lurid glare over the whole of the north-eastern horizon, but a sharp fall of rain, accompanied by a lull in the storm of wind, soon led to the subduing of the wide- spread conflagration. A portion of Mr. Dowsett's crop, near the railway, was ac- cidentally fired on the same day by the sparks from a passing locomotive engine. It was, however, soon subdued. A con- siderable bush fire also raged at some distance from Kyneton, in the direction of Kangaroo Creek. We have not received any particulars from that quarter. The total loss from bush fires during the past fortnight in this district must be very considerable. Every care and precaution should be taken to avert such conflagrations. We hear that Messrs. Ewart and Shepherdson's Saw-mills, situated in the Seven-mile Forest, were destroyed by a bush fire on Wednesday. The water-wheel was saved by the water being turned upon it, and the steam-engine was also got out. Several cottages adjacent to the mill were destroyed. Ac
