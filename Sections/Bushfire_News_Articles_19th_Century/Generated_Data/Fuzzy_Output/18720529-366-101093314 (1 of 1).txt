ars if carefully preserved. In many places I observe large areas where the axe of the splitter is yet unknown, and where the timber averages from 100 to 150 trees per acre, with a diameter of from 2 feet to 6 feet and from 250 to 300 feet in height, the most of which are as straight as an arrow, with very few branches. In some places, where the trees are fewer and at a lower altitude, the timber is much larger in diameter, averaging from 6 feet to 10 feet, and frequently trees of 15 feet in diameter are met with on alluvial flats near the river. Many of the trees that have fallen through decay and by bush-fires measure 350 feet in length, and with girth in proportion. In one instance I measured with the tape-line one hugo specimen that lay prostrate acros: a tributary of the Watts, and found it to be 435 feet from its roots to the top of its trunk. At 5 feet from the ground it measured 18 foot in diameter, and at the extreme end, where it was broken in its fall, it is 3 feet in diameter. This tree has been much burnt by fire, and I fully believe that before it fell it must have been more than 500 feet high. As it now lies it forms a complete bridge across a deep ravine."
