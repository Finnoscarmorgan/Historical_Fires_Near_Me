sts that only a small portion of this thriving agricultural district has suffered. The Carngham correspondent of the same paper states as follows :â€” The most intense heat has been experienced in this district during the last two or three days. On Saturday the thermometer in the sun ranged during the day from 1400 to 145 degrees (Faren heit), and from 100 to 105 in the shade. During Sun- day afternoon a cool breeze sprung up, and black clouds, indicative of rain ; towards evening the sky gradually brightened, and the night was most sultry ; yesterday (Monday) was nearly as hot as on Saturday ; several bushfires wore seen burning in the distance, and huge columns of smoke were ascending in every direction. A strong wind, blowing from the north, coupled with the glowing heat generated by the fires, rendered the atmosphere perfectly intolerable.
