mosphere. ? The heat of ihe weather (says the Maryborough Ad v ertiier) on Saturday, Sunday, aud Monday was ex treme, and its effects were plainly visible iu the jaded faoes and languid carriage of every oue we met. We have never, during a lopg residence in the coloDy, known three such hot days follow oon seoutively one ou the other. On Saturday, at ' 1 o'clock, the thermometer stood in tho shade at 116° ; ou Sunday the temperature was slightly lower; and yesterday it was more intense than either. Even so late as between 4 and 5 o'clook^the thermometer stood at 109 ° in the Bhado. - About Benalla tbe bush is on fire In every direc tion. The fire oovered . more than six miles of ground. The Daylesford correspondent of the Mail re ports : — Bush fires are raging all around us — at Stoney oreek, Doctor's gaily, Spring cieek, the dry. dig gings, aud indeed in almost every direction. From the Wombat hill, look whioh way you- will, the country seems in ono universal blaze. The heat is almost suffocating. Many have declared this day (Tuesday) to be the moat oppressive they. ever ex perienced. Information of damage done has not yet reached this, but great fears are entertained relative thereto.' .
