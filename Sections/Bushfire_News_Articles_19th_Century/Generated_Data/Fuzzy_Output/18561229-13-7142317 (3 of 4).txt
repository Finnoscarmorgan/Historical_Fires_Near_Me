is body was discovered in a water-hole by some diggers on the Back Creek side of the Bendigo Flat, in a line nearly opposite to Barrow's Bee-hive Hotel. Information was at once given to the police and a shell procured, in which the body was removed. We understand a sum of money and some papers were found on him when taken out of the hole. His horse has been in the possession of the police some days, having been found straying. No clue whatever has as yet been found to account for his being dis- covered in such an out-of-the-way spot.— Bendigo Advertiser.
