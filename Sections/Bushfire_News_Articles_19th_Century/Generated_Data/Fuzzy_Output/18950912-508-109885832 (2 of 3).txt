The Bush Fires. MILTON, Thursday — The bush fires have been urged on by a strong westerly gale, miles of country being alight. At Yatteyattah Messrs. John Whatman, Jacob Deal, and J. Adcroft had their residences and contents burnt, leaving them with very little more than what they stood up in. Mr. John Moore had his sheds burnt, and with difficulty the house was saved. Others also with difficulty saved their homes. Mr. S. See, at Kingerman, had his piggery and sheds burnt. A great deal of damage has been done, fencing and grass being destroyed in all directions. The homestead of Mr. Barbour has been totally destroyed. GULGONGi Thursday.— T
