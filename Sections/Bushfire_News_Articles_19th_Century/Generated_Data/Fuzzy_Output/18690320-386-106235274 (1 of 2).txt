o the number of 200 again seated themselves in rows under the shade of a large tree, and were regaled with Seed, Plum cake and fruit. The teachers, the friends of the children and other neighbors united in partaking of the plentiful repast, and by their active interest in the recreations of the day, seemed to enjoy themselves as much as the juveniles. The day was cool and delightful and all as they went home at sundown agreed that the re-union had been a very pleasant one.I -o0--- IT is with sincere regret we hare to notice the total destruction of Mr. Hi. Hall's house and premises at Mandurrah, by a bushfire, as also that of Mr, Peel and the Church; bushfires had been raging in the vicinity for some days. It is supposed that the high wind prevailing carried a piece of paper-bark to the thatched roof of the Church. Mr. Peel managed to secure some por tion of his property-it was while engaged in trying to rescue the Harmonium of the Church from the flames, that the fira reached his own house. Mr. H. Halls is we fear a total loss.
