FORBES ITEMS. [From Our Own Correspondent.] Forbes, Saturday. A welcome change came up on Thurs day night with a few light i-howers, which made the past few days quite pleasant , but there has not been sufficient rain to cheek the bushfires which are burning all round the district. There is an immense cloud ef smoke hanging out to the westward of Forbes, which means that there is a large fire out in that direction. The Quarter Sessions were finished this morning after taking up the whole week, and Judge Docker, in adjourning tbe court, said he hoped it would be a long time before there would' be such a heavy list again. ? The following sen tences were given this morning : â€” For horse and buggy stealing, Claud E. Bryant, 2 years each offence, con current.'' Robbery with violence, Alfred McCar thy, 7 years ; Joseph Kelly, 7 years
