as inexorable. Judge my sur- prise then when I daily saw the bridge being constructed by the contractors, under supervision of a Government engineer, of the trees growing in the swamp alongside the bridge, of all sorts of even the perishable kinds of timber, unsquared, and not even barked! The result was that this costly piece of work went very quickly to pieces, and becoming dangerous, had to be superseded by a more costly bridge. I made some inquiries. and received the reply that palm 'oil' judicially used smoothed all difficulties as to inconvenient conditions of contracts. Unless some devastating bush-fire has removed the ruins and wreckage of this first Moe bridge. there must be ample evidence of its faulty construction of inferior mater- ials there to this day.
