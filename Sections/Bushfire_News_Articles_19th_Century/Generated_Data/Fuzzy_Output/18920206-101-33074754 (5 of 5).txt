He, therefore, thought no fur- ther legislation was necessary. He thoughl it would bo well if the Government would inquire whether it was possible for th« farmers to consent to legislation imposing upon them, in the way of clearing or plough ing round their boundaries, which would teni greatly to prevent bush-fires from spreading as they did. He doubted, however, whetbei they would be willing, as if they wero thîti was no need for them to wait for legislatioi on the subject. The motion was agreed to. Mr. PATERSON said that ho lived near i railway owned by private people and he was constantly suffering from fires. He though provision ßhould be also made against sucl fires, at the sarao time as they were legielat ing for the prevention of fires on Governmen linos. Mr. RICHARDSON contended that no only on the Government Railways but oi private lines it ought to bo made compulsor to carry a spark catcher.
