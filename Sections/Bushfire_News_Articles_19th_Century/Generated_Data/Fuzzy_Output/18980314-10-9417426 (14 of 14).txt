d, and the smouldering logs and burning trees never have been left to be fanned up by sudden wind gusts, and the sparks blown everywhere to start fresh fires, it is very evident that much country would have been saved. A constable camped at every fire, with 10 working men under him to watch and stay the progress, would have saved all the after fires. But all was foolish confusion, a simple looking on and reporting, and as if the flames would stay themselves, no effort of work was made to stop the onward spread. Sir, in the mass of the losses both in Victoria and in this country the lawlessness of the bushfiring illegally has been the root of the disasters. The saving of some trouble and of a little money by burning in the hottest summer months instead of the late spring is "the penny wise and pound foolish" policy of the lazy and the selfish. Sir, it is only right that such unwisdom should be punished by the State in the proper protection of the more considerate and just-minded people. —Yours, etc., March 12. WARNING.
