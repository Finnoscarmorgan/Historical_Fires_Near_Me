 Water is scarce on the roads now. There is one stage of 35 miles, and also between Mingi- new and Nanakine a distance of 22 miles with out water. The Nanakine well is reported to have gone dry. Messrs. D. McPherson and F. Nairn arrived here on Thursday on their way to Geraldton with a mob of horses. I hear the plans for the building of the school house here are at Linthorne's Hotel. It is nearly time a move was made to get a place so much needed. Another great want is also being attended to, namely, a telegraph line here. A party of surveyors are busy surveying from here across to the overland line. Bushfires are raging all around every day. The Midland Company have a team carting stone for the station, I believe it is their in tention to put up a stone building instead of an iron one. With a school, a post office and a railway station put up, Minginew will in deed be going along. A horse belonging to Mr. M.J. Morrissey was badly ripped by a bullock last week. Minginew, January 20th, 1894.
