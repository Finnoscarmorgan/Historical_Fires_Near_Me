the result was that the fire, being favored by an exceptionally high wind, rapidly gained the mastery. It would be hard indeed if owners of property injured by fires started under such circumstances had no remedy at law. But it is to be hoped that Wie decision arrived at in this case will bring home so forcibly to the minds of people proposing in future such operations as those carried out by Mr. Sabine the importance of the re sponsibility they incur, that 'occasion Jwill not often arise to chronicle shniliar cases of neglect. At present there is reason to believe that the salutary provisions of the Bush Fires Act are not observed so generally as they ought to be. Con victions under that -Act involve the imposition of penalties which alone should be sufficient to secure compliance with the law ; but when it is seen that the careless may also be punished by having to pay compensation for wrong done to private individuals through their neglect, it is reasonable to hope that the effect will be to ensure much more ready obedience to the requirements of the Act than is now exhibited.
