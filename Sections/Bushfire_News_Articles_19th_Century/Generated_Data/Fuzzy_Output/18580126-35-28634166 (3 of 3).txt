TWO CHILDREN LOST IN THE BUSH. -On Saturday last Gunning was thrown into a state of excitement on it becoming known that two children of the respective ages of five and seven, the sons of Mr. Timothy Buck- ley, bad not been seen all day, although search had been made in every part of the town for them, and it was not till late on the following day that any infor- mation could be obtained concerning them. Great was the joy of the parents, when Mr. Wav returned from the bush with one and Mr. Walter Woodhouse with the other, in a wet and forlorn condition. It appears that the children had strayed from home on the Saturday morning into the bush and were unable to find their way back, and consequently were ex- posed to the frightfully heavy rain of Saturday night and Sunday morning.
