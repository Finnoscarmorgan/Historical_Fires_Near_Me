 some distance further on, where there is a road going off to the right, towards the Kin gower diggings, a lofty black range of mount ains is almost in front of us and the road turns their left flank. These are Bryant's Ranges We are now on the tableland, which is tolera bly level; but the road is remarkably dusty and continues so , into the diggings, where the climax of dustiness is reached. This want of firmness in the ground, and its tendency to pulverise, is a remarkable feature in the country about the ranges, as compared with that about Bendigo. The district seems to be one peculiarly liable to bush-fires which constantly destroy a very prolific underwood. and hence the prevalence of dust. This is the idea which is suggested; but there are other ex planations just as likely. The ground seems to be of that description which in wet weather is rotten and boggy, and of course in dry is easily broken up. As the Tableland begins to descend, quartz appears along the road, and we gradually enter into a district where all the auriferous indications are strongly manifested.
