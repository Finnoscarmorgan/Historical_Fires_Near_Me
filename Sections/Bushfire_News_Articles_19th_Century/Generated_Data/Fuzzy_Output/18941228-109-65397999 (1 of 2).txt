A LITTLE GOOD ADVICE. If your clothes or these of anyone else should catch fire do nct rush about for water or attempt to beat it cut as if it were a bushire, but roll the burning stuff quickly in a tight mass and it will be ex tinguished instantly. Should this be impos sible then cover it with any woollen article at hard and crush it out. If this is done calmly and quickly you need not so much as blister your hands.
