 or tank by hand labor. Attached to the off wheel is a toothed driving wheel about two feet in diame- ter, and on top of the tank next to the seat of the driver, is another toothed wheel of smaller dimensions on the axle of which is a crank which works the force pump in the interior of the tank. The machine is drawn by one horse, and as soon as the horse commences to move the pump is set in motion. When in use a horse and branch are fitted to the outlet pipe, and the pressure is sufficient to send a stream of water 50 feet. The driver from his seat on the tank can direct the stream of water on to the bush fire, and the faster the horse is made to travel the greater is the pres- sure set up. The machine may be used, either when in motion or when it is stationary, but in the latter case the pressure is exerted by manual labor. It should be a most useful machine during bush fires, and its adaptation to the work should be of much interest to those who are liable to such visitation.
