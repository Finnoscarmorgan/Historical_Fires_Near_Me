miles of fencing were destroyed. Messrs. Jas, Snodgrass J, W. Clune, M. Cluue, and J. Anderson, selectors on the runs named, alto lost either grass or fencing, and in some cases both. I cannot close this without expressing the thanks of the owners of Mangoplah, Pullitop, and N.E Mangoplah and the selectors on the three iuus, to Messrs. Best Bros, and their staff of men from Sandv Creek, who arrived at the fire at a very critical time and rendered most valuable assistance s in fact, the amount of work done by the Sandv (Seek party is something to look back upon with pleasure, and to be spoken of at future fires for the rest of the season.
