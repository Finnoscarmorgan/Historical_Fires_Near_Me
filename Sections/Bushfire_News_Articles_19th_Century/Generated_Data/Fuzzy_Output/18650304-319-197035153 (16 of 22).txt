f Messrs M'Mahon and Beau mont have been destroyed, but we believe in both of these cases the crops and bnildiDgs were saved. The above are the fullest particulars we have been able to collect, but there is every reason to suppose that the injury sustained by the farmers and othors is considerably above what we have recorded. Un der any circumstances it is a terrible visitation, and we trust that tho public of the district will take steps to alleviate the sufferings of those who have been rendered houseless by this frightfnl calamity. —M.A.Mail, March 1. NEWSTEAD. Newstead was yesterday surrounded by bush fires, and many of the inhabitants are apprehensive for tho safety of the town. As a girl was washing in Marsdon's yard, sparks from a fire lighted outside flew on to a dry dung heap, the straw immediately ignited, and had it not. been for the strenuous exer tions of a score of men, several of the houses would most probably have been consumod. Tho bush fire on the range near tho Bridge Inn was, at three o'clock, towering yards high. Some horses, startled by the blaze and smoke, broke away, and tho resi dents were in a state of excitement and dread. — M. A. Mail, February 28. MOUNT 1IORIAC. Mount
