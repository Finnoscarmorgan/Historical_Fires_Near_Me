l Nations ground, and in passing through one of the drives the two armed men were found asleep. Two of the party, armed with waddies, were detached to prevent these men from creating a disturbance in the event of their awakening, whilst the remainder made a careful examination of the terra incognita. This done they left, and it appears the party was so quiet in carrying out its examination that the two Dog berrys. were not awakened. We are informed that the party who explored the drives came across some rich ground during their careful inspection of the All Nations works. — Talbot Leader, February 2. Bush Fires.— Several bush fires raged about us on Sunday last. One in German Gully, near Gib raltar, was unusually fierce, and threatened at one time to spread far arid wide, but owing to the exer tions of the residents it was eventually extinguished. Beyond the Adelaide Lead there was also a similar visitation, which was not put out without consider able difficulty. The rank condition of the grass just now renders bush-fires of more than ordinary im portance. Too much caution cannot therefore be exercised by those who are in the habit of making outdoor fires. — Talbot Leader, February 2.
