blic should strongly protest against its continuance. If it is the duty of the Government to erect buildings for educational purposes, it is equally incumbent upon them to take necessary precautions to protect them. An unfenced building is neces- sarily a greater risk than one which is suitably enclosed, and on grounds of economy alone, the Education Depart- ment is bound to see that every structure under its control is suitably protected by a fence from outside interference. It was the want of forethought that brought about the destruction of one of the State schools in the Heytesbury Forest, by the bushfires of January 5th, 1886, and in other respects the depart- ment will be the sufferer if it counten- ances unfenced buildings. There is no doubt that the children are benefitted in a case where there is a fence around the State school building; but their convenience cannot be fairly used by the department as a plea for getting out of a just responsibility.
