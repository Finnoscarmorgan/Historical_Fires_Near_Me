BOWNA. We are enjoying pleasant weather since the cool change which occurred last week. Great disappointment was felt at the disappearance of the rain after only one'day's showers, which had threatened to be a splendid downpour of many days. The country about here is bearing* very parched look, but I am glad.to My that no stock has been' loBt through tne scarcity of grass or water. Great consternation was occasioned here a few days ago, I believe, at what might have been a large bush-fire. Some' imprudent people set fire to a stubble paddock, and a high wipd having ariBen, carried. the fire a little further than the intended ;spot. However, it was quite got under before any great damage was done, with the exception of some fencing being destroyed ; but Btill the termination of suih a fire-could have' proved mos^isafltrorfs: The Alb'ury xaces are' always an 1 ^attraction for the residents of many outside. districts. This one iB not an exception, for I noticed a goodly, number of our Bowna friends present. Some " got up" in great style for the occaaipn.
