Sons of Freedom, the Sisters of Freedom and the battery at the Galway. I am glad to see that the Bairnsdale people take more in- terest in this locality, and a better field for prospecting does not exist in the whole of Gippsland. Mr Jorgen- son is still prospecting, but it is a great drawback that there is hardly any water to try a prospect, unless going for miles. The weather has been exceedingly hot and unbearable lately, with not the slightest signs of rain, and if no change occurs, things will look gloomy indeed as regards water for drinking and for cattle and horses. Everything is dried up, and bushfires are raging. Such a state of things has never been known here before. Strangers from different parts are arriving, attracted either by the reefs or in search of alluvial gold, and it keeps Mr. Hollensen pretty busy with his coach.
