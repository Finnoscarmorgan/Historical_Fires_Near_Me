BURNT TO DEATH IN A BUSH FIRE. LOCH, WEDNESDAY, Jan. 12. Patrick Connelly, of South Melbourne, a married elderly man, who was assisting Mr. Callanan in the survey of a dense scrub land between Loch and Jeetho yesterday, is thought to have been overtaken by a bush-fire while Mr. Callanan went a mile away for water. Large search parties were out after him yesterday and to-day. Connelly's instruments were found burnt, but no trace of Connolly himself has been discovered, and it is now feared there is no hope that he has escaped burning. The fire has obliterated all the tracks. Black trackers would not avail to find Connelly
