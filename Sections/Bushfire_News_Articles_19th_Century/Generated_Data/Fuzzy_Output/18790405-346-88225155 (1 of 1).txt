A New Way to Burx Stubelk.—The fanners of the Wimmera seem to have inven ted a peculiar method of getting rid or their stubble, preparatory to ploughing the ground for a fresh crop, or, at any rate, the plan, if not now, is one we have never before wit nessed. la many of the paddocks along the line of railway, a pair of horses may be ob served dragging behind them what appears to be a portable bush-fire. On closer inspec tion it is seen that the horses are harnessed to an iron harrov.- clogged with burning straw. The harrow gathers up all the stubble as it goe3 along, and the straw is consumed as fast-as it conies into the harrow. This mode of preparing the ground seems to an swer remarkably well in fields where tho stubble is too thin to be removed by the ordinary method of burning off. — Hamilton Spectator.
