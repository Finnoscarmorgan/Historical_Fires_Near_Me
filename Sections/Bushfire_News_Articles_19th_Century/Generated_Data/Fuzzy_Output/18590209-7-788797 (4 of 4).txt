 further extension would be marked by the mo3t disastrous consequences. The late fires have ruined many a poor hard- working man. He has stood by and seen the fruits of his hard toil reduced to ashes in a few short minutes ; or has been himself compelled to fly from the death that else awaited him. Some- thing should be done to check this sacrifice of property, which, if left to the carelessness of the smoker, the camp fire-lighter, or the log blaster, will every summer be in increasing jeo- pardy. The strictest laws should be enacted and enforced against any act which involves the risk of creating a bush-fire ; but as, after all prohibi- tions and penalties, these ,oSence3 will occur, there ought to be proper measures taken for at least averting the march of so destructive an enemy as fire in a parched and inflammable land. We shall be glad to be furnished by our friendsÂ» jn the country with further d-taibiof the late disastrous fires, and especially with parti- culars of the property consumed. Something should be done for the relief of those whose losses are the most serious, and whose prospecta have thus suddenly disappeared in the flames.
