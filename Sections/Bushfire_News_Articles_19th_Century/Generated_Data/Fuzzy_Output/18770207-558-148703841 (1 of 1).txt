SOUTH AUSTRALIA. Adelaide. Tuesday. Duffield's mill, which was recently destroyed by fire, was re-opened to day. A bush-fire at the Government farm and the neighborhood did considerable damage. Captain Barber's new river steamer, Victor, has been launched at Goolwa. A valuable presentation has been made to Mr Sinclair, Mayor of Port Adelaide, in recognition of his six years' mayoralty. The steamer Victorian, when starting for Melbourne, ran into the new dredge AVilltinga, and sank her in the channel, at a width of 250 feet. The Victorian and Claud Hamilton returned to port. The channel is said to be blocked. The accident is very serious as the Willunga was depended upon for large harbor improvements at Port Adelai
