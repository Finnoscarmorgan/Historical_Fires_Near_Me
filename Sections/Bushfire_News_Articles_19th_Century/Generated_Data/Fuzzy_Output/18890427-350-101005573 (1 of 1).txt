at the present time about 150, it having increased by 100 in the last three years. The only two roads cleared are the Bathurst Road and Benara-street. The others badly need clearing. In fact some of the allotments it is difficult to get at at all. A rather good story is told in proof of this. It seems that a gentle- man who came down last Anniversary Day, offered a resident a guinea to find him his two allotments. One was discovered, after a couple of hours' diligent search; but the other has not been found up to the present time. The difficulty of tracing these allot- ments has been increased by the bushfires that took place last November and which removed the pegs. For the past twelve mnonths efforts have been made to induce the Government to clear the roads, through Mr. S. E. Lees, M.L.A., but hitherto without result. Part of Wentworth, it may be mentioned, is in the Nepean and part in the Hartley electorate, a creek here dividing the two. The drive from the Railway Station to the Falls is one of the finest in the moun- tains and it is claimed for Wentworth that when the ground taken up is all laid out it will then be one of the nicest places in the mountain district and no doubt it will be.
