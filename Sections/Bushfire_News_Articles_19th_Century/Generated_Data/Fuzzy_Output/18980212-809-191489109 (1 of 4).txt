DREADFUL FIRE IN THE BEECH FOREST. APOLLO BAY TOWNSHIP IN RUINS. A RESIDENT BURNT TO DEATH, SCORES OF PEOPLE HOMELESS. COLAC, Friday. A terrific fire has passed over the Beech Forest, clearing almost everything before it, and effecting the greatest devastation within its precincts ever inflicted by such a visitation. The seat of the fire was the Gellibrand River country. The creamery out houses were burnt, and only with ex treme difficulty was the creamery itself saved. From O'Brien's Hill to near Cape Otway the country has been swept by flames. Heavy losses resulted to selectors. Messrs. J. H. and G. Congr
