Fair looks thy land to the eye of the stranger, With sun brightly shining o'er valley and. hill, Kissing the face of thy lakes, 0 Tas mania, Tossing a smnile at each bright little "i1l. Chorus.-Farewell Tasmania, thou 'home of my childhood Blessings rest on you where ever I roam, Prosper your valleys, your hills, and your wildnwoods', Farewell Tasmania, Tasmania my hfome. Away on, yon hilltops the cattle are grazing, They'll graze on the same there when I'"n far away, Aind bright In the distance the bush fires are blazing, And the air all around me is scented with hay. Shall I see this bright island of ours again ever, I think as I look at its wave-beaten shore. But down in my heart a voice seems to say, "Never," Thou wilt see fair Tasmania again ,never more. Then good-bye for ever, thou home of my childhood's, I'll think of you ever when far, far away, I'll pray for your. valleys, your hills,. and your wildwioods, At the opening and close of each swift passing day. P.S.-I am very fond of composing poetry, and have other pieces far nicer' than this one; but they are either too long or unsuitable
