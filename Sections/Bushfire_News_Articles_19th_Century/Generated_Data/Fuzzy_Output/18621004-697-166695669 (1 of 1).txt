e has also been some refreshing rain in the Hunter River Valley. But near Sydney there has been little more than a few occasional showers. The crops in many cases will be a failure, and market gardens in dry situations are almost unproductive. The wheat crops are in some instances already being cut for hay. Oaten hay has risen to a very high priceâ€” so high indeed that it is not at all improbable that there may be importations of pressed hay from other colonies. Within the last few days the unusual sight has been seen of hay being sent inland from Sydney for use on dairy farms. There have been several bush-fires of consider able extent, which have in some cases still further reduced the available pasture. The poultry show took place in Sydney this week. It was not quite so good nor quite so well attended as on previous occasions, though by no means deficient in interest. There is a growing number of enthusiasts in poultry, and it is well that Eome should take this department under their care. There is a great difference in the quality of different kinds of poultry, both as respects laying and fitness for the table, and annual exhibitions tend both to diffuse informa tion and to improve the breed.
