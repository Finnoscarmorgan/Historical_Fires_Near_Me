 The erstwhile cabbage gardener has now become a prince of orchardistB, He has 12 different kinds of cherries at present. Of these he says the Margaret is by far the best for eating. After that he places the Florence, tl e White-heart, and the Black- heart. We shall not soon forget the feast of Margarets we bad. FirBt there was the feast to the eye, as they hung in clusters upon the treeâ€”large* luscious, almost jet black, nestling under the tender green leaves. It was something quite new to us to see a tree of black cherries, and it was no small treat to the palate when upon that burning-hot, sultry, bushfire, hazy day, we had the pleasure of eating some, Our orchardist, in common with his confreres, has been troubled to 80.ee extent by his cherries at an early stage turning yellow and falling off. He could not tell us what was the canse, as tbe affected trees, so far as he knew, were sound and healthy, and situated auaongst trees that have ripened their fruit satisfactorily.
