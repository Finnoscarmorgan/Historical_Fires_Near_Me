flames from spreading. On Mrs. Homersham's property, near the Eagle-on-the-Hill, the fire which swept the hills and gullies last week, and was thought to have been quenched, broke out again early on Thursday morning. Some labourers, however, saw it in time and stayed its progress. A fire was raging in the scrubby hills near the Greenhill-road, but from all accounts had not done much damage except to fencing and timber. There is every reason to believe that the worst of the bush fires is over, and on Thurs day night there were signs of a change in the weather. No reliable evidence of the origin of the bush fire which threatened Hahndorf has been obtained, but it is 6et down to unprin cipled persons, who wish to reap the benefit of the tons of charcoal which would accumulate all over its track. The fire along the range bordering the road from Adelaide to Echunga is attributed to a swagman's revenge for being refused work. Several mounted troopers have been sent to the various places visited by the fire, and are seeking evidence.
