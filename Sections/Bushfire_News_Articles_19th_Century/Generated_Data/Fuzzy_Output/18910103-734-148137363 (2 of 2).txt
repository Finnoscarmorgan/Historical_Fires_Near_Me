hed. In l he letter signed "Tom Tit," I said that I had no ill-feeling in making personal remarks, biit that I wished for people to have the fore thought not to put off until to morrow that which can be done to-day. If Mr. Parker and Mr. Hamersley had arrang ed to have sent but two men each to have released us that night the fire would have been extinguished, and Mr. Hamersley would ^ow have had his grass for his stock, and the Messrs. Par ker would have had the hay in rick which was consumed by the bush-fire. I may write again so that the public might glean some useful hints how to combat and subdue bush-fires, and per haps prevent some from being ignited, and detect those who wilfully and ma liciously set fire to them. I am, Sir, yours, etc., WILLIAM BURTON. Millbrook, Dec. 26, 1890.
