the Hoe. I have pleasure in visiting and shaking hands with him. Three miles down the river at Scott's Creek, and six miles off at Cowley'B Creek, there are settlements. But if better means of getting to market were provided this magnificent country would be opened up. A rail way or tram-road through from Camper down to the sea could easily be constructed, j It wonld be a public as well as a private benefit For the sake of the pioneers I hope some facilities in this line will soon be afforded them, tor of the many very pleasant memories I carry away with me from the West that of the trip to the Heytesbury Forest and the Hoe will not be the least pleasant
