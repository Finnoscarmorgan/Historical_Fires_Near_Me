FIRES. Oar exchanges teem with notices of fires, chiefly arising oat of the late drought and beat. The Mercury writes:—" Very large bush-fires continue to rage in the forest south and east of Daylesford, the strong winds giving increased fury to the flames. Every now and' then a heavier squall than usual causes the fires to leap forward on their prey like some devouring monster. On Thursday especially, the country was enveloped in thick volumes of smoke, espe cially in the neighbourhood of Musk Creek. A resident of that neighbourhood informs us that the fire there presented a front fully a mile in width, the trees being alight from bottom to top, and the roar of the flames audible for a considerable distance." .• The Kyneton Guard
