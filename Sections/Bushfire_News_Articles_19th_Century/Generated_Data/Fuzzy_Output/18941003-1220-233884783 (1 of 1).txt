Davies, District Registrar. Mr. I.' R. Boardman was examined with regard to a bill of sale given to him by bankrupt, and Messrs. S. Bond and A. Cochrane concerning bank rupt's dealings with them in respect to certain farm lands. The examination was then declared concluded. Fires. — The hot weather of one or two days of last week assisted in again fostering bush-fires. One outbreak up the river destroyed a large quantity of scrub, and extended to the culvert just beyond Skillion Flat, which will have to be repaired with new planking. A barn on Mr. J. J. Keough's farm, Gordonville, North Arm, was also destroyed by fire the other night, together with about 700 bushels of maize. How the fire originated is a mystery. Messrs. Hayward and Jen nings' sawmill at Port Macquarie likewise suffered last Tuesday, but the blaze was extinguished, ere much damage was done. Presentation for Bravery. — Capo.
