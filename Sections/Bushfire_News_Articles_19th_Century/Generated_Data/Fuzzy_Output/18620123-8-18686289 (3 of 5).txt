n destroying the monster, whioh measured 6 feet 6 inches.-Jfonaro i/ercury, Jan. 17. BUSH FIRE.—DEATH BY BURNING.—A rumour was in circulation through the town this afternoon of the death of a young woman, aged 22, daughter of a farmer named Steenson, residing at Kurrajong. The accident appears to have been caused in an attempt to suppress a bush fire, which endangered their property. The deceased, with other members of the family, became alarmed at the near approach of the fire, and while endeavouring to keep it back, her dress caught fire, and she was speedily enveloped in flames. The smoke from the bush fires for some weeks past has been almost suffocating in and-around the town. For some hours the town would be enveloped in dense columns of smoke. Notwithstanding this, the announcement of this young woman's death has caused astonishment; for, in the present civilised state of the country, it is surprising that homesteads like this one where the accident occurred, so many years established, should be in danger from any bushfire.—Empire's Windsor Correspondent, THE LATE CAPTAIN LAMB, R.N.—We regret to an- nounce the death of Captain Lamb, one of our most eminent, useful, and respected colonists.
