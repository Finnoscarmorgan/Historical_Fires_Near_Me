 rendering it impossible that they can run away in any state of the wind ; that they are auto- matic in their action, that is that they do their work without any other aid than that which the wind supplies ; that they are less complicated, and therefore more easily erected and put in operation than any other windmill eyer introduced; that they require no attention beyond an occasional visit with the oil- can; that, being, constructed, entirely of iron, they are unequalled for durability, and will regain unaffected by the weather for any length of time ; beside which they are necessarily proof against bush-fires ; and, finally, that they supply the cheapest power in the world. They can be applied to any depths up to 200 feet, and according to the depth will lift from 200 to 500 gallons per hour. In many cases, however pumps, are required for situa- tions where intermittent action is out of the question, and to supply this want Messrs. David Munro and Co. manufacture from their own designs a centrifugal pump possessing many novel features of design. A specimen of this was also in tho late Exhibition, and moving, as it did, a perfect Niagara in minature, was noted at the time as the most remarked, an
