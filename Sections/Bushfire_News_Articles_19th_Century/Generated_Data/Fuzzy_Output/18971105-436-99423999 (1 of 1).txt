The crops in this district are, on account of the scattered rains that have fallen during the last month, very variable. In some places the wheat is 5ft. high, and expected to yield five to six bags per acre, while in others the late sown is not 1 foot high and parching up. Grass is abundant, and bush-fires will have to be guarded against during the summer. The weather at present is dry with rain threatening.
