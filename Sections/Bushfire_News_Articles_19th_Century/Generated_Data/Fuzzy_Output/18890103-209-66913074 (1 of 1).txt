state. The surface is well covered with small tussooks, clover is plentiful in places, and during good seasons doubtless grows luxurian tly, but I did not notice either ryegrass or cooksfoot, and all the land I drove over appeared to have never been broken up. At the far end of the broad valley, and close under the foot hills that stand like tie advanced guard of the higher ranges immediately behind,is situated the farm I had come so far to see. The site is a charming one, and the view towards the moun tains must be a most attractive one on a clear day. When I visited the place the haze of smoke from bush.fires half concealed the outlines of the hills, but I saw clearly the form of Mount VWel lington; at whose foot lies the beautiful little lake discovered last year by Mr. Riggall. A trip to this is becoming a favourite outing by the dwellers in this part of Gippsland, and as the scenery is said to be very beautiful, there will doubtless soon be numerous visitors from other parts of Victoria. The lake is as yet unnamed, but surely the right of the discoverer to name it will not in this case be o erlooked. In the neighbourhood it is called''" the new lake" by sonme, and by others , 'Lake Riggall."
