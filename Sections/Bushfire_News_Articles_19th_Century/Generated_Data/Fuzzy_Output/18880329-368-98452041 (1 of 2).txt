Tait, and W. R. Riley, and driven to the Commercial Hotel. The Minister called at Binalong, Yass, Fish River, and Broadalbane on the way from Harden, and inspected the station accommodation at each place. Certain departmental matters of no publio importance were also dealt with. Several bush fires were observed in the hilly country on both sides of the line, between Binalong and Bowning. A fierce fire was raging close to the railway, and fanned by the wind the flames were apparently carrying ovorthing before them. A largo bush fire was also burning on the hills about a mile from Yass station. Unless rain falls speedily the forest fires will prove exceedingly disastrous in thebo southern and western distriots, as the tall grass is everwhore as dry as tinder, and liable to ignite at any moment and devastate the country for hundreds of miles.
