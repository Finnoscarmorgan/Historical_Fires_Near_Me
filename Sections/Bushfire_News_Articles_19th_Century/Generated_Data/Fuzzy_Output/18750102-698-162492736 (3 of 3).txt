f land, or equal to, say, twenty-four bushels to the acre. At Goulbura (says the Herald of Wednesday) the weather oontinues hot and dry. It. is now a long time since we have been favoured with rain, and the waterholes are dried up, and the grass is becoming brown and like tinder. Bush-fires have been very frequent, and have approached the town more closely than on any previous occasion, burning off the grass in BlackBbaw's paddock. Mr. George Cole, of Malton on the Wollondilly has. suffered damage by the destruction of grass ' and fences to tbe amount of about £400. Showers that | would extinguish these fires are much needed ; but as harvest is. now in progress, it would perhaps be as well if continuous rain were not to fall just yet. There is, how ever, no doubt that the conntry is beginning to suffer from drought, and that with the amount of stock now on most of the holdings, this has become a serious matter. Prayers for rain have been offered up in the churches on t£e last \ two Sundays. Since the above remarks were written, namelv at 7 o'clock last evening, we were visited with a good Bhower, accompanied by thunder and lightning.
