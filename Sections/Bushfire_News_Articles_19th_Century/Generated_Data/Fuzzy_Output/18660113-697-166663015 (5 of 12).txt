 around them are illuminated by an advancing line of fire extending for miles ; leaving behind it thou sands of blazing logs which light up th land scape so as to make it present the appearance of an im mense city after nightfall. Wo are sorry to say most of these fires are the result of gross carelessness. We look upon the man who starts a bush fire as being equally cri minal with the man who thrusts a firestick into the farmer's haystack. The grass is the sole dependence of the grazier ; it is as valuable to him as the standing wheat crop is to the agriculturist. Moreover there is no saying where a bush fire may stop. It may sweep over the country for scores of miles, and it changes its direction with the ever-varying changes in the wind. Perhaps by great exertions a num ber of people may beat it out, but it usually bursts forth again two or three days afterwards to scatter fresh desola tion around. Of course when the grass is dry as tinder, fires may be accidentally caused. The friction of dry branches agitated by the breeze, against one another, or the concentration of the sun's rays into a focus through the bottom of a broken bottle â€” causes like these have been known to produce bush-fires.
