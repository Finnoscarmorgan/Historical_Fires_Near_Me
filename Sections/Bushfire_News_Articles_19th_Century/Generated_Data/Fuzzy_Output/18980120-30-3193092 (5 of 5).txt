A strong wind had fanned the smouldering embers into flames and sparks were flying in all directions, threatening danger to a number of buildings which escaped destruction last week. Happily the wind changed, and turned the flames away from the town back into the bush. The danger is by no means over yet, and the settlers are becoming ex- hausted by the strain of watching their properly day and night and beating out the flames started by sparks and other flying debris. Dangerous fires are raging at Gordon and Pakenham, and are doing great damage to fencing and grass.
