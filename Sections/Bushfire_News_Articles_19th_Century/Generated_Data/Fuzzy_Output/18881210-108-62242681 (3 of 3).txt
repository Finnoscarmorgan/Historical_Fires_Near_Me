pushed on to Mr A. G. Traill's, the popular member of the mining board, when we found that gentleman, who is one of the greatest lovers of cricket, and one of the best men the Dargo cricket club posseses, awaiting us as usual, and he invited us to take lunch, which was very acceptable on such a summer's day. We had a few miles to go, so on we pushed and arrived at our destination soon after 3 o'clock. After tea we adjourned to the mechanics' institute, where a dance was got up by the young folks of Dargo for our reception. There being none of the Dargo young men present, as they had to go and put out bush fires, the young ladles were left to take charge of our team and make us enjoy ourselves, which we did. During an interval of ten minutes, light refreshments were handed round by the ladies; and, when we had done these justice, dancing was again commenced and kept up till three in the morning, when we returned to our quarters for a few hours sleep. At about 12 o'clock the following day (Saturday) the match com- menced, and Forbes, our captain, winning the toss sent our opponents in to bat, and in a very short time the eleven men were out for total of 31 runs, A. Traill being top score with 13. Af
