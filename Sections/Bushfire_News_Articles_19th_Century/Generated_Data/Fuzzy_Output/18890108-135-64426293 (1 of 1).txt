Mr. A. Harris has been with us and met with a rery cordial greeting, for we can all testify to his being a hard working and zealous member at all times. We are to have a children's picnic on Wednesday next About £7 has already been collected, besides heaps of promises of cakes, tarts and other good things, so our young folks are sure to enjoy themselve
