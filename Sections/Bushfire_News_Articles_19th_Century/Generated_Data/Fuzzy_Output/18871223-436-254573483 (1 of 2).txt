TO THE EDITOB OF THE ALBUBY BANNKB. SIB,â€”With regard to the fire mentioned in your Warmatta correspondent's letter, the disaster in question, upon a raging hot-wibd day, originated upon the holding of a selector two miles Irom the nearest part of the Momolong estate, and 20 miles from the homestead ; and before it was perceived by those in charge it was upon the run. Then, sir, it was the bounden duty of employes to put it out upon their employer's land if possible. Squatters are not perfect by a long way, nor their station bands either; yet their record of causing bash-fires is not neatly so heavy a one as that of the selectois. The selector, I suppose, relies upon his neighbors coming to bis assistance, and Is not so careful in iiis use of fire. All the large bush-fires of recent years have originated upon the lands of the selector, mainly through the carelessness of themselves or their employet. With regard to the charge made by your correspondent about the rations, the reputation of Momolong stands so deservedly high in that respect that the insinuation can be treated with contempt. For twenty-five years and more it has been the subject ot eulogistic comment
