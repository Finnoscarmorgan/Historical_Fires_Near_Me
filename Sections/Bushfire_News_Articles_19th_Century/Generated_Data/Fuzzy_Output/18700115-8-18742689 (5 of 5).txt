nt fire seeming to be behind the farther peak of the twin eminence known as the Sugarloaf mountain. Comparatively near to the town, in a direction that will be best indicated by saying that it appeared to be in the bush beyond the hills that flank the Dagworth estate, a very large bush fire was pursuing its destructive way yesterday afternoon; although when we saw the smoke at half past ten from the gaol hill in East Maitland it seemed that a very trifling area was being burnt. But at two o'clock huge volumes of smoke were rolling up over a large expanse of ground, and it was evident that the largest bush fire of the season had its place there. Some small spirals of smoke were as- cending from among the Paterson mountains during the forenoon, but there was in the evening no fire of any con- sequence perceptible in that direction.

Owing to the ex- cessive heat of the weather the attendance was very small, only about 43 men having been present. It was an- nounced that the ordinary Commanding Officer's parade (undress uniform) will be held on Thursday evening nex
