e the worse for the adven- ture. The passengers were, of course, a little frightened at the thought of being roasted to death, and the driver of the coach was much scorched about the face and hands. The coach, top, was slightly scorched, and the horses just a little bit singed. Credit is due to Cobb's driver for the plucky manner in which he met the difficulty. On getting out of danger, the coach was stopped close to a gang of men and Mr. Hopkins's charge, who were endeavouring to check the progress of the flames, and Mr Hopkins kindly showed every attention to the affrighted travellers. An extensive bushfire has been raging at Khull's Range during the week (reports the Goulburn Advertiser), and over 10,000 acres of grass and Â£2,000 worth of fencing has been destroyed. The Messrs. T. and D. Webster, English, and Thorn are the prin- cipal sufferers. The bush also adjacent to the township of Toolamba was on fire on Tuesday, but as Mr James Winter received timely warning it was, we believe, speedily extinguished. The Ballarat papers report that bushfires are raging in that district. Out Cheswick, Bungaree, and Smythsdale way the forest is on fire, and daily records of disaster reach Ballarat. News fr
