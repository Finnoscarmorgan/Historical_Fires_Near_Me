THE WEATHER AND BUSH-FIRES. Yesterday was one of the most pleasant days we have experienced for a long time past. During the day the heat was by no means op- pressive, and at night the temperature was decidedly cool. The late rains have evidently extinguished the bush fires to a great extent, although yesterday there were indications in several directions that they are not yet entirely got under. From Eaglehawk a fire in the direction of the Whipstick was observable, and during the afternoon dense volumes of smoke arose towards Marong. However, none of our country correspondents have communicated with us, and it, may, therefore, be taken for granted that there are no serious conflagra- tions in any of the districts surrounding Sand- hurst. The following telegram from Beechworth, dated Monday, appears in yesterday's Argus:â€”The weather is still terribly sultry.
