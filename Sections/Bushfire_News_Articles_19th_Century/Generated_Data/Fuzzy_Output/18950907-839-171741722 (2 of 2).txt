In connection with the destructive bush fires, which occurred nearKempsey, (N.S.W.) last week, a very pitiable case is reported. A settler named Donnelly, at Piper's Creek, had his house and everything destroyed, except the clothes the family had on them, and they were obliged to go into a ploughed field and remain. While there the wife gave birth to a baby, the husband putting a few slabs around her and leaving her, to come to Keinpsey for provisions and coverings.
