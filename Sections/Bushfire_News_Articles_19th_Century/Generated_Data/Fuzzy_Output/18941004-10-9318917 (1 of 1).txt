litting, staves, etc; also sassafras trees. A dense scrub over all the land - peartree, musk, tree fern, and the usual description of scrub. The land -Two or three thousand acres of this description would do well for the ordinary Farmer, but not for the village settlement. The land is well watered by creeks, with a westerly aspect. 27th.-Proceeded to Hastings in company with Mr. Hay No. 3. Inspected No 1 as marked on the chart. It is good land, and fairly level, and in time, when cleared out, would make a good dairy farm, as there are several hundred acres, bottom land. The trees dead from effects of bushfires; it would take some trouble to clear it for grass. The timber where green is principally stringy bark, but not of much value. Well watered. North and Eastern Aspect - Adapted for the ordinary Farmer, but not for the village settlement. No. 2.
