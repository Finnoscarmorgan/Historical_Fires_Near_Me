rings they lay bare are controlled by the right hand of Godâ€” Not a new god with all the improvements, but simply the old-fashioned Lord Whom our unscientific progenitors knelt to o' nights and adored; If the backwood old fogies who yet fancy Christ our pre- eminent Friend, In defiance of Science and Reason should hold all the trumps in the end, It may be the rouseabout swiper who rode for the doctor that night Is in Heaven with the bishops and priests robed and sceptred, and splendid with light; It may be that Freddie and Nabbage roam abroad o'er plains shining and wide, Where wings take the place of bush horses and boundaries are spacious to ride!
