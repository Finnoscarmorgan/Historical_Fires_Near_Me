It may be remembered it was stated that a bush fire or wrecker's light was mistaken for tbe light at Cape Agulha?, and the vessel went ashore. An inquiry into the loa« was held at Bredasdorp, in the colony, ami the Court held the plaintiff, the captain, mates and crew to be free from blame, attributing the cause of the stranding of the ship—first to the disarrangement or deviation of the com passes on board ; secondly to the unsteadi ness and uncertainty of the currents in that direction ; and thirdly, to a bright fixed light or a bush-fire that was burning before the accident, which was calculated to mislead the managers of the vessel.
