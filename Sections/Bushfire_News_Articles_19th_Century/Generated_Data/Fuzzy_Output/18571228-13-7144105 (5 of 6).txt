Many a digger's tent suffered the loss of its fly; and not only private buildings, but public ones also felt the severity of the gale The Wesleyan Chapel, although roofed with zinc, did not escape, one-half of the roof being taken clean off. Part of the fly of the hospital was carried away, and many other places suffered damage. All day long exten sive bush-fires filled the air with a dense va por, making the rays of the sun appear of a bright orange tinge, and objects at a distance almost invisible. It was reported that a large store at the Alma had been burned, but on inquiry the report was found to be incorrect. About eight o'clock in the evening, the wind suddenly veered round to the south-west, accompanied by a few drops of rain, and to wards morning a brisk breeze from the south completely cooled down the over-heated at mosphere.-Ibid.
