EDENHOPE. (from our own correspondent.) March 24. The rain that has Dtely faen (some 70 points) in this put of tbe district has done much good in many ways, bat especially in estjngnisliing the bash fires that had been raging in various parts. Although no serioas damage has been done by tbe fires, stall several thousand acres of bosh and grass have been consented. It is commonly rumored abont bete that these fires owe their origin to the rabbit inspectors: if this report be troe (and I have every reason for crediting it), it will give rise to serious reflection on the part of landowners whose properties sre situated in tbe vicinity of Government lands infested with rabbits. We can cope with the harassing rabbit, thongh it be at great cost and with macfo trouble, bnt with the raging bushfire,
