houlder while attempting to arrest a man named William Wil liams. The struggle. must have.bsen a . severe one, although the oonitable was assisted by Mr. Lawson, Of the Serpentine, who was himself stabbed between the forefinger and thumb of the right hand. The man Williams is now lying in a critical condition in the Inglewood look-up, suffering from severe contu sions on ihs hill, received during the struggle. From what we have been able to learn respsoting the particulars of the afiray, it appears that Constablo MoGnire had been absent from ths Serpentine polioe station on Wednesday last, visiting a bush fire. Wben near the station on his return, about seven o'clook in the evening, he was aooosted by Williams, who stated that bis boras, saddle, and bridle were missing from the poat-oEoe store, where he had left them. The constable told him to look about for tbem; but Williams rafnssd to do so, alleging that it was the constable's duty, and making nse of some opprobrious epithsts at Us same time. He left ths constable, however, but soms time after wards went to the polios-station, and informed the oonitable that he had found the missing property, at tbe same time demanding lodgings for the night.
