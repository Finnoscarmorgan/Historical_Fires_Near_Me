within half a â€”ITeraM. A destructive fire broke out on Wednesday in the Ironbark Ranges, between Mosquito and Myrtle creeks, caused, it is supposed, by the careless use of matches. Commencing among decayed timber and rank grass, it caught J. Slaven's paddock, destroying pasture, fences, &c.; Despite the exertions of all the available residents it spread to O'Douohue's selection, burning 60 chains of fencing. 200 acresjof grass, and valuable timber. Thence it spread to T. Wright's, iialf^a .pule distant. Mr Wright lost 100 acres of >grasB with the surrounding fences. Young's selection adjoining also caught fire and 200 acres of grass, and a large quantity of fencing and timber was burnt Towards evening the wind changed, saving Messrs Steane's and J. B. Watson's property. On Thursday the fire travelled towards Mount Alexander in the direction oi another farm of O'Donohue's, on Myrtle Creek. The country in this locality is heavily timbered, and therefore it was almost impossible to check the fire, which is now extending over seven miles of country. Incalculable damage will be done unless heavy rain falls.
