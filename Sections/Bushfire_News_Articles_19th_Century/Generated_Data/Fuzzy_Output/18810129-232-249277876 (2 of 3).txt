BUSH-FIRES. Another serious fire occurred on Tuesday on Mr Samuels' Mount Greenock estate, b; which that gentleman lost about 100 acres of splendid grass. Mr Samuels was absent from home when tbe fire took place, which it supposed to have been caused by some lads who were shooting in the paddock. AsBoon as the news of the fire reached Talbot Messrs Stewart, Wilson, and Co. closed their mill, and, -with their workmen and other assistants, after great exertions, beat out the fire. Tbe grass destroyed was of cspedil value, as, being a splendid crop, it irss being saved for autumn feeding, and was the best on the estate.â€”Talbot L
