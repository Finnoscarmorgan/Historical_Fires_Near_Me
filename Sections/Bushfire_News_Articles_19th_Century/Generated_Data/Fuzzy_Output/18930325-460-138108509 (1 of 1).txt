SSLEATON AND WEROXA. Ma.ncH 20. On Saturday, March 4, the hot weather was partially broken by a cool change, and light showerd fell for sOme days at intervals in some parts of the district, but no rain ot importance has yet fallen, and we are now Buffering once more from theJ continued drought In many cases cattle have to be driven to water, and the outlook for the com ing winter is not very reassuring, as grass is certain to be scarce in the absence of early raius. During the summer this district has been very fortunate with regard to bushfires, not one of a serious character having taken place np to the present I notice tbut much is being said and written on the subject of the danger from tire attending the use of phos phorised wheat in the extirpation of rabbits, and I think a line here on that subject will not be out of place. I can speak from my own experience and that of others who have need phophorised wheat in large quantities and amongst dry grass in the hottest weather. I have never seen or heard of a case where fire has been caused by it. I have often thrown lighted matches into a can ofthe wheatafterithadstoodin the sun
