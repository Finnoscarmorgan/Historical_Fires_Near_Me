. This report has, we are glad to learn, siuce been contradicted. The following is from a Doodle Cooma correspondent, under date 18th January The fire is uow on the western part oi Doodle Cooma run. Messrs. Keighran Bros., their employes, and a number other men. endeavour to keep the fire within bounds, but as a strong north-westerly breeze has eet in I am afraid it will break through tbe line and sweep all over Doodle Cooma, Edghill, and Grubben. If this should happen, I think some of the runs on the eastern side of the railway line are in danger." Our Urana correspondent, writing on Monday says :â€”" Bush-fires have been pretty numerous in.thiB district of late, the sky having been lit up nightly with their reflections in all directions. The principal has been that which broke out the other side of Brookong on Tuesday last, in the direction of Bullenbong, and which was at length and with difficulty extinguished when within 200 yards of the Bullenbong Hotel on Friday, having in its course swept the selections of Messrs. Ditchfield, Bramhail, Thompson, &c.;, and altogether, as I am told, about 60,000 acres of grass, besides burning two horses. Another one broke out upon Mr. Rand's station at Mahonga
