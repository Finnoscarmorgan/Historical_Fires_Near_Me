BUSH-FIRES.-Several large bush-fires have been laying bare the country to the eastward of Kilmore, from the confines of the munici- pality to the Running Creek, and extending southwards. The fires have now abated, but we are sorry to hear that a party travelling across the country has seen the remains of two or three horses and some cattle which fell a prey to the devouring element. Mr. Fredk- Stander, a well-known carrier, had a valuable draught horse so severely burnt that little hope is entertained of his recovery.-Kilmore Examiner.
