ear, nor see, My poor old, aged mother Who nursed me on her knee. Time has wrought many changes In that good old home, so bright, Since my roving spirit led me To my lonely camp to-night. The moon's pale rays are sinking fast, The shadows long have grown ; The thoughts of home, and garden old, Have like a phantom flown, And the deadwood trunks of the boree Like spectres ghastly loom, Out of the lonely, dismal, brushwood. The bush, the rift of gloom; The dark and base charred brigalows, The desolate frowns they wear, Stand above the verdures remnants Like gibbets grim and sere ; Blasted by the sun and bushfires Their crooked limbs hang low, And burning winds of arid downs Wring their knotted hands of woe. No gleaming grace of the willow tree, The breeze no fragrance wear, No flower, or bee, or ferny glen, No form of beauty rare; But a lonely, lingering silence. Making night Uie tomb of day, Till scenes and brightest dreams of home In darkness fade awav. -ANON. Arainac, July 10th, 1893.
