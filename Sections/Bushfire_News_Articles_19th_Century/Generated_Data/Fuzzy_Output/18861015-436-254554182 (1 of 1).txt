 were occupied iu uie first instance, was the scrub now complained about there ? I do not refer, of course, to any mallee country, but to that now said to be overrun with pine and other scrub. I say from old experience, no ! How, then, is it the land has ot late years become so 1 The reason, sir, is overstocking— the greed and grasping system of trying to make tbe land carry three times the stock nature intended. I may he asktd how does this affect the scrub question ? The answer is simple : Do not overstock, and in the average of seasons you will have plenty of grass, and plenty of grass often means bushfires—no doubt inconvenient, and at tim^s severe and long sustaiued —but the quid pro quo is, no scrub for years. One busbfiie will do the work in twenty-tour hours that otherwise would take years to accomplish. In conclusion, fair play and no favor to the pastoral interests, bnt do not at any price let ibfm become the future e>ligarchy of this colony, by throwing into their laps tbe patrimony ot tbe people in shape of compensation for improvements.—Yours, Mr. Editor, Moorvvatha, October 9.
