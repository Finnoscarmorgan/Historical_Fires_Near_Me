ry, could not fail, if awake, to see the surface of the earth steaming and blazing from the burning coal, where by day, as in the case of Wingen, there are only smoke wreaths and steam to indicate the combustion. Nor in Australia is evidence wanting. Not far from Red Head, south of Newcastle, there are two places in the cliffs, where combustion has gone on, in one case, within fifteen years from this present time, and the traces of that fire are still evident in the natural brick containing burnt impressions of coal plants, and in other indications of the action of heat. In a country like this, where bushfires prevail, a fallen tree in flames might be sufficient to ignite a bed of coal or bituminous shale, and once ignited, such a bed would con- tinue to burn, if in such a position that the air could have free access to it. The Mount Wingen range is a branch of the mountains dividing the Page River from Kingdon Ponds, and this range is connected with the volcanic barrier be= tween it and the interior,'called the Liverpool Range. The Wingen Rocks consist of por- phyry, underlying an extensive series of coal beds, consisting of conglomerate, shale, sandstone, coal and lignite, which latter are natur
