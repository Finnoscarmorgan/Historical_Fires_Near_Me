less hardy but more nutritious grasses out of existence. Destroy them by fire before the seed is skaken out and they soon disappear from the pasture, and their place is taken by the more valuable grasses and herbs. Mr. Haly quotes authorities to show that the charred remains of the old grasses act as a stimulant to the pasture. The manner in which they act in this respect has been illustrated in this way:â€”Suppose a certain area of pasturage to be strewn over with leaves and twigs of trees, these would not improve, but, as is well known, tend to sour the pasture. When, however, they are con sumed by a bush fire, the charred remains act as a valuable stimulant, and the consequence is a speedy and improved flush of grass. Of course the improvement of grasses by means of burning is only advocated as an expedient in the case of our natural pasturages. Where cultivation can be adopted, and the quality of grasses controlled by that means, a resort to wholesale burning otf is needless. But periodical burning has been advocated on other grounds, and, amongst tho rest, for the destruction and prevention of scrub growth ; and several who have adopted Mr. Haly's advice have borne testimony to the value of the
