ire whereby two stacks of corn, the property of Donald Shaw, of Hazel wood, were destroyed on the 12th March. Mr. James M'Kean appeared to watch the case on behalf of Mr W. Northway. Donald Shaw deposed; I am a far mer residing at Hazelwood. I remem ber the morning of the 12th Marcb last. I heard a crackling noise as I was lying in bed. This was about day-break, about half-past four. I got up, and on looking our, saw a blaze in the stack yard and my corn stacks on fire. I went over to the stacks after alarming the household. I looked round when I was at the stacks, but saw no one about. There were no bushfires about. The stacks were alright the previous night, and if there had been a fire I should have seen it. There were no swagmen camping there at the time, and no children about except a child of my brother's, who was two years old, and who was at my house the day before. I made an attempt to put the fire out, but by the time I had put a ladder to the stack it was all in a blaze, and I could not stand at it. The fire, when I saw it, might have gone over both stacks in an hour or an hour and a half. The stacks ran south-east and north- west, and the fire started in the south-east end. Mr Marshall
