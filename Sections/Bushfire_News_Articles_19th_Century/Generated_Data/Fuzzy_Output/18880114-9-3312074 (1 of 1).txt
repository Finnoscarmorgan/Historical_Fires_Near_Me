abet " ar- rived in Hobart last Sunday. Great preparations are being made for the opening of the Broken Hill Tramway next Thursday and two special trains are to leave here to- morrow. Two aboriginals have been brought into Port Augusta from Erlduna Station, Alice Springs on a charge of having stuck up the station. The exceedingly hot weather now being experienced throughout the coun- try districts is very favourable for har- vesting operations. Port Lincoln re- ports that some crops are yielding from 20 to 35 bushels to the acre. A number of sunstrokes have been reported from the country, and several bushfires have occurred. One most destructive fire is reported from the Mt. Gambier district, despoiling many miles of the best pastoral country. It is estimated that 10,000 sheep have been burnt. Kemp and Clifford are now in full training on the Parramatta. Both are in good form but Kemp is at present considerably over his rowing weight. Hanlan is in training for his match with Neilson. It is probable that Hearn of Kew Zealand and Perkins of England» will be matched for a big stake shortly. The share market is now very brisk. Broken Hills sold here to-day for £215, and in Melbourne for £217. Eveleens
