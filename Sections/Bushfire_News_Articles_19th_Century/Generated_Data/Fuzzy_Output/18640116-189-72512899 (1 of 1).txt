o term it, was observed by several persons resident in different parts of this district, and even as far as Mary- borough, one of our residents determined to ascer- tain whether the color was the consequence of dust, as was generally supposed at the time; but curious to relate, although a certain quantity was put into a clean glass on Saturday last, and allowed to re- main quiescent until yesterday, not a particle of sediment could then be detected at the bottom. We have heard an explanation of the cause, namely, that as the rain clouds came to us from the north, they would have passed over the large bush-fire which was then raging in South Australia, and have be- come impregnated with the smoke arising there- from; but the absence of all sediment in the glass referred to, would lead one to dispute the correctness of this deduction. We cannot say whether this phenomenon is, strictly speaking, novel, but either way, it may be regarded as an interesting circum- atance for chemists.- Talbot Leader, 15th January.
