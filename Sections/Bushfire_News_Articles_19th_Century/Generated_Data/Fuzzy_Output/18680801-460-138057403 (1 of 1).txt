In. the first place, were they the work of the aborigines, it is scarcely probable that they would hare been so uniformly spread; and in> the second place it is not probable they would have chosen a loose pebbly beach on which to cook and eat their food in preference to grassy spots at hand. It has been urged that as charcoal has been found among these shells, it is evidence of camp-fires. What is more likely than that fragments of charcoal, would be strewed on an ancient beach, in a fan} where bush-fires are so numerous, to say nothing of the camp-fires of the blacks? It is well known that they opened the bivalve* shell-fishes by partially roasting them, while they crushed the shells of the univalves. Now,, while the bivalve shells are, as I have already stated, in a comminuted condition, the univalves* are generally entire, and too small to have* served for food, as the greatest proportion of" them are small turbo and trochus. The frac tured state of the shells is probably due to the ravages of predatory fishes, for the dredge re veals how great are the numbers destroyed* by their finny an
