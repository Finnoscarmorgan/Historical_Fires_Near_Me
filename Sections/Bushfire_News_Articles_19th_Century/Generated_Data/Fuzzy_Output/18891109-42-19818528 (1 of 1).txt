ed with Mitchell, blue, and Flinders grasses, studded With pebbly ridges lightly timbered with white wood and bimerab, the river frontage being heavily timbered with good useful timber for building and fencing purposes. There are now eighteen paddocks containing together an area of about 380,000 aores enoloeed by substantial sheep-proof fencing, and it is a pleasure to Bee fencing kept in such admirable repair. Some of this, whioh Mr. Bartlam informed me waa erected last year, struck me as being the most suitable sheep fence I have seen for this country where timber is scarce, carriage expensive, and bush-fires prevalent. There are 110 boree posts 4in. in diameter and 330 iron standards 1 Jin. by *}in. to the mile. The boree posts are sunk 2ft. in the ground (strainers 3ft.), and the iron stan dards, 12ft. apart, are driven with a sledge hammer 18in. into the ground. The standards are punched for six wires.
