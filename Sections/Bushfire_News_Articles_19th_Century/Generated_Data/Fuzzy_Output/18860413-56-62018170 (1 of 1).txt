 been con- structed down the mountain, though it is not of sufficient width to admit of driving a vehicle down. There is one spot which urgently demands attention, and doubtless has not es- caped that of the Under-Sccretary. A few yards off the track is a large hole some twelve feet in diameter, opening into the Devil's Coachhouse, with a clear drop of 500 feet, into which the unwary may easily fall, and to make matters worse the track in this particular place is indistinct, so that one is apt to deviate from it in the dark. The hole has been covered over, but the covering has been burned away by the bush-fires. There is also another hole of a similar character, though not so awkardly situated, with a drop of 270 feet. We mention this that visitors may be upon their guard.
