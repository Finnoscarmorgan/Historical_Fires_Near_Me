n of Mr. Dowsett's crop, near the railway, was ac- cidentally fired on the same day by the sparks from a passing locomotive engine. It was, however, soon subdued. A con- siderable bush fire also raged at some distance from Kyneton, in the direction of Kangaroo Creek. We have not received any particulars from that quarter. The total loss from bush fires during the past fortnight in this district must be very considerable. Every care and precaution should be taken to avert such conflagrations. We hear that Messrs. Ewart and Shepherdson's Saw-mills, situated in the Seven-mile Forest, were destroyed by a bush fire on Wednesday. The water-wheel was saved by the water being turned upon it, and the steam-engine was also got out. Several cottages adjacent to the mill were destroyed. Accounts have reached us of the destruction of some 800 acres of various crops on the Loddon, belonging to Mr. Bryden. The bush fires in the Kyneton district are still raging : even as we go to press, pillars of smoke may be seen rising in different quarters. —Kyneton Guardian, Jan. 3, FIRE AND LOSS OF LIFE AT EPSOM.—A fire took place on Saturday night, about nine o'clock, at the house of a miner named Duncalf, living on Epsom
