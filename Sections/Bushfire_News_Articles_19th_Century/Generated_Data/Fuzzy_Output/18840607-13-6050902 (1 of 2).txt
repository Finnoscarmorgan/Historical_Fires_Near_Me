The first glimpse of the blue sea through a eucalyptian trellis of gold and green is worth the whole journey, and from this alti- tude it looks vividly blue. In different places along these ocean slopes we find large patches of young wattle scrub springing luxuriantly, and may conclude from this that within the last few years a bush-fire has swept across this part of the country. Wattle scrub is brought into existence by influences just the opposite of those that induce the growth of other trees. The seed of most of our forest trees germinates when a sufficiency of moisture is provided, but excessive heat is the raison-d'etre for the wattle. The black seeds, which seem to retain their ger- minating power for many years, are preserved in the mould, without being in any way affetted by ordinary climatic conditions.
