The peculiarity in the) pastures was that though it was winter the grasa and herbage was as dry as fchoy are in Victoria at the end of December, and in tin' wide i»i*wpect dis- closed there were to be seen the smoke of numerous bush-fires. The train stopped .it the little station of Hendon, where I was mel. by Mr. Charles Clark, I of East Talgai, and my long northward journey o£ over a thousand milos wa» at an end.
