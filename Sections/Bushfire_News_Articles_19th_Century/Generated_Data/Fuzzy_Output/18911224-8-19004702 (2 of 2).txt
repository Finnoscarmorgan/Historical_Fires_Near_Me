DENILIQUIN STOCK REPORT.-Friday evening^ December l8, 1891.-The weather has been fine and cool during the week. The pastures are now drying up rapidly, and every breeze of wind drives clouds of grass about. A good fall of rain would be welcome, but there does not seem to be any in. dication of a change for some time to come. No more bush-fires have occurred this week and none are wonted. Those of ' last week were particularly extensive and disastrous. They were burning on North Deniliquin, Perricoota, and Woorooma, three different directions from the town, almost simul-r taneously. The wool season is over, but there are still a few odd bales of wool dribbling into the rail- way station. The stock passings are falling off, but the stock routes remain in fairly good condi- tion.
