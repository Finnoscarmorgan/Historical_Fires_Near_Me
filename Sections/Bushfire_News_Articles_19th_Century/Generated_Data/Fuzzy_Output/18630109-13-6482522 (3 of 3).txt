BUSH FIM√èS IN THE WEST.-During tho past week bush-fires have been very prevalent, and we expect fat cattle will soon bo at a very high price, as many of tho stations are en- tirely cleared of feed. It was reported on Saturday that the stations of Mr. Whitehead, Spring Creek, of Mr. Joseph Ware, Muston's Creek, and of the Hon. Kiel Block, Glenor- miston, were all on fire. The camp of Mr, Cooper, Government survoyor, at Castlu carry, near Glenormiston, was completely de- stroyed by the devouring element. The Wood- ford Forest was also all m a blaze on Saturday night, nnd wo expect to hear of damago amongst tho farms. -Warrnambool Examiner, Jan. 0.
