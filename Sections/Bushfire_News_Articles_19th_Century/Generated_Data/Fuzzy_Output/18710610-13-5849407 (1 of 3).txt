 we first sighted land about Cape Recif. 1 think we were about 35 miles distant. Not having worked out the observations, I cannot say positively. There was a haze over the land at the time. I cannot say how we were then steering, although it was my watch on deck. We were steering along the coast a littio off. At sundown we lost sight of land, and made tho land again the following day a long distance off, scarcely visible-cer- tainly moro than 30 miles. An hour after we were out of sight of land again, and keeping off. On Friday evening, the 17th inst, at 8 o'clock, I observed a large fire on shore, a bush fire ; also a very bright, fixed light, which 1 supposed to be tho light of Cape L'Agulhas; it was to the westward of the bush fire, and about 12 miles off. We lost sight of the light at about 11 o'clock, when it was bearing four points abaft the beam. There were two men on tho look-out, one on either bow. The look-outs had not reported land. I fancied I could see land, but as it was hazy and a cloudy sky I might have been mistaken, particularly knowing that land was to starboard. I reported my opinion to the captain, who altered the course about two points and a half by our compasses dead to sea
