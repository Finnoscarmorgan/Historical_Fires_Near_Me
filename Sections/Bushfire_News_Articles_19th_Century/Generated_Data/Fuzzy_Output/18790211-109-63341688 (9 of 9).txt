e fruit on the trees. In Ballarat there has been almost a counter- part of Black Thursday. The heat is in- tense, and the smoke from bushfires resembles a thick fog. The Warrnambool Guardian of Saturday says. â€”Large bushfires have been reported on all sides during this week and last. Throughout the district most of the large estates have suffered more or less, some being very heavy losers in grass and fencing. Along the coast to the eastward several fires have also been burning. The funeral of Mary Turnbull, John Miller, William Miller, Charles Turnbull, and Annie Turn- bull, all victims of the great bush fire at Irrewillipe, took place at three o'clock on Sunday afternoon, in the Colac cemetery. About six hundred persons were present, of whom more than two hundred followed the bodies. Andrew Turnbull, the husband of the deceased, and the sixth victim of the fire, died on Sunday at two o'clock. Ellen Miller, the only remaining child, is still in a dangerous condition. Mr. Standley is get- ting on well. Fierce fires are raging in the forest at Gerangamite and Irrewillipe.
