ught up the young herbage, which will soon afford better sustenance. All kinds of stock are reported to be in excellent condition. In the country liable to- inunda tion from the Talbragar River great obsos of sheep and fencing have been sustained. At present, however, the waters having receded, there is a prospect of fine pasturage on the lands recently flooded. It is reported from Wagga by the Express of Saturday that the weather has been unaltered during the past week. The heat iB still very great, and although upon one o itw o occasions there have been indications of a change, no rai n has fallen. Bush-fires have been prevalent, but if we ex cept one at Mangoplah (Mr. John Cox's) by which some fencing was destroyed, they have been unattended with dis astrous results. Feed is plentiful, but dry, and water is still abundant. Down the river the rains have effected & most beneficial change. The grass is springing beautifully, and stock are in capital order. This fine change has been experienced as far down as Eastern. Hot and dry weather has again set in on the plains. Heavy rains have continued intermittently over most parts of 'Western Queensland. The weather upon the Darling continues unsettled.
