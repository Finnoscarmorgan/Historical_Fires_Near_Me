rence here. Fires to the north, fires to the Bouth, east and west have been started within this last week. Owing to tbe gra8B being a bit green very little damage has been done, but should a fire break out at the end of the year not only animals in hundreds bnt human life will surely be lost, as in tbe present state of the country it would be impossible for footmen to get clear. A fire broke out on Tuppal yesterday (Sunday) about 1 p.m,, and burnt about 30,000 acres of grass on Tuppal, Coree, Hartwood, and Wonamona stations. It is now nearly under command, but the burning trees are likely to start fresh fires if they are not well watched. The Irish delegates aro to visit Jerilderie on the 23rd of December, and I hope to see a strong contingent from Tocumwal and Berrigan, as the cause is good.
