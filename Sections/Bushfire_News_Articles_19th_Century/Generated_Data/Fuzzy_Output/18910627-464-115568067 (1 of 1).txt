From the fact that there are to be no ' camps' ia this colony, and that the destination or ambition of so many labour leaders just now seems to be, not prison, but Parliament, it may fairly be hoped that here the lesson has not been without effect, and that all danger oÂ£ the Queensland bush-fire spreading to New South Wales may happily be averted.
