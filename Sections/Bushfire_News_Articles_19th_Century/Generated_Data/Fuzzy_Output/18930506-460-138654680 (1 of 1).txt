I think, the first to run sheep through a trough filled with a solution of that drug to cure foot-rot. The arsenic remedy was tried by many Riverine flockmasters, but it did not prove the success that was anticipated. The dis ease has spread over Riverina. and has ad vanced through Western New South A Vales till it has approached the Queensland border. The type of foot-rot prevalent in Central Aus tralia is highly contagious ; even a bush-fire has failed to destroy the germs of the disease. A flockmaster in Central Australia lately gave me a strong proof of the readiness with which the ground may be infected.
