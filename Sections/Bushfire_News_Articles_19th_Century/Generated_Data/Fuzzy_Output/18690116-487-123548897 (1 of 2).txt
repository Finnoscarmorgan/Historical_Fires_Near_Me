TUMVT. (raou oub correspondent.) January 14th.â€” A very welcome change in the weather took place on Saturday last; towards evening the climcta gathered up in the west and on the following morning a fine eenial rain fell till near noon. It then cleared up, but the rain that had fallen produced a very beneficial effect by cooling the atmosphere and damping the dust of our streets, though it was not sufficient to extinguish the bush-fires which continue to rage with unabated fury. The abnvenientinncd change on Saturday was accompanied by a violent gale of wind, and shortly before 6 p.m. the inhabitants of Tumut were suddenly startled from their serenity by a series of indescribable sounds, which some compared to cannons fired at iron targets, sudden thunder, or falling trees. The commotion was caused by the whole of the corrugated iron roof, all of the battens, and some of the rafters of Mr. Mandelson's store being carried off by a whirlwiud, which crossed Russell-street and struck tho store at the corner with full force.
