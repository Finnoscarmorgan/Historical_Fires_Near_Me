ull swing, and, except in the mallee, where the crops have failed badly, the wheat re turns are fairly satisfactory. The oat crop is generally light, and barley yields are poor, while at the same time the grain is very thin, though of good colour. Over the whole of the northern districts, where dairy ing is practised, the milk yields are shrink ing daily, on account of the parched condi tion of tie pastures. In the coast districts the heat- wave, has done a good deal of damage to the grass, by causing it to dry up, and a reduction of the output of butter fac tories may, in consequence, be expected. . Bush-fires have already begun, and unless j great precautions are exercised, much damage is likely to be caused before the end of the summer, as there is a consider able quantity of dry grass in most localities. The Government experimental bore at Bando Station struck a flow of 2J million gallons of water daily at a depth of 1,000ft. The shipments of butter during the cur* rent season amounted to 52,000 boxes, re presenting 1,300 tons. It is estimated that at the close-of the year the exports will exceed that of 18W, when 80,000 boxes were shipped. Some months ago the Ministers of Agri culture for Que
