Nullawarre, July 26th. 1895. DEAR CINDERELLA,— I have noticed in The Leader, which we have taken for many years, that you have started a column for the children. I am going to tell you about the part we live in. It is called Nullawarre, and is a very wet place in Winter. It is in Heytesbury Forest ; and water is about the ground most part of Winter. Summer-time it is very dry and warm ; and bushfires are very plentiful. We did not always live here; we came from thr Wimmera. We have been here fourteen months, and I go to Nullawarre North school, I am in the sixth class. I got my certificate when I was eleven years old in the fifth class. I should like to be one of your little writers if I may. I have a nice flower garden, but I will tell you about it next time. I have nothing more to tell you so I must say good-bye. — I am your little friend, EVA SMITH. Age, 11 years 10 months. Try again for the letter prize Eva. I am very pleased to have you for one of my writers.
