ses, Mr. Cratchett, junr., having received a telegram from Willunga. left Moonta on Saturday morning to proceed thither. The proceedings at the Moonta Police Court on Monday were of unusual interest The first case was one in which a man named Bawden, residing at Moonta, was charged with committing a most heinous offence. The evidence adduced was of a revolting nature (probably without a parallel in the records of the Moonta Court), and the prisoner was committed for trial at the next criminal sittings of the Supreme Court. Mr. Wilkinson, of Weetulta, was charged with manslaughter, in connection with tbe fire which recently occurred at Kalkabury, and which had such disastrous results. A great deal of interest was taken in this case, and a number of farmers residing in the Kalka- bury district were present. Fourteen witnesses were examined, and Hr.Wilkinson was committed for trial.
