To the Editor of the Herild SIR, I hope you will pardon the liberty I take of addressing the public about the lamentable con dition the York Road is in: at present, also the Beverly Road, except where A. W. Smith's party is located. That officer is deserving great praise for the substantial road he has carried through the swamp to the Dale Bridge, and for the alacrity with which he at all times brings his party to bushfires on beiug summoned by the settlers, thereby saving valuable home steads from destruction. I remain Sir, Yours respectfully.
