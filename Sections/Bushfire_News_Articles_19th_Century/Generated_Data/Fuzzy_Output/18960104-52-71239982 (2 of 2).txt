ild- ings, so as to reduce the chances of a fire to a minimum. In the wheat-growing districts much straw is still left standing where the strippers have been at work, and in many places it certainly would pay to cut this with reapers, and stack it for .future contingencies. When cut into chaff and mixed with oats, crushed beans or peas, it makes tolerably good winter feed for stock. If the straw should not ba required, it would be advisable to carefully burn it off, and the ash would fertilise the land. In its present state much of the straw is a standing menace to both homestead and fencing should a bush fire take place, which is not an unlikely thing at this season of the year. Land that is intended to grow next year's wheat crop on, whether it be virgin soil, or land that has been under cultivation, should be broken up as soon as it is in a good workable condi- tion, so that it may receive the full benefit of the sun and atmospheric action. This will decompose any plant food that may be stored up in the soil, and render it more easy of assimilation by the crop. Land that is intended to grow the winter crop of potatoes on should now be worked, and enriched with manure if not naturally fertile. I
