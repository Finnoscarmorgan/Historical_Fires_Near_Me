COUNTRY LETTERS. WILLIAMS RIVER January 1. Harvest has commenced, but I regret to say that red rust has made sad havoc amongst the grain, oats as well as wheat. The weather, as usual at this time of the year, is very hot, and several bush-fires have started within the last few days, but as far as I can learn, have not caused any losses beyond a few miles of grass..... On the 19th ultimo we experienced a slight shock of earthquake. The effect was noticed over a distance of twelve or fourteen miles, causing panes of glass to vibrate in the windows. This following so closely upon the shock at Champion Bay, will lead us to expect such visitations.
