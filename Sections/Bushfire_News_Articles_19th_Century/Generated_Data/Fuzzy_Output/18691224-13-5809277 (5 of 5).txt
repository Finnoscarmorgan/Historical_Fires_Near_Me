 the east, black and threatening clouds mounted towards the zenith, covering half the beavens :the centre space was filled with a yellow light, into which the sun (which hung in the midst luce an incandescent globe) seemed ever to be darting vivid streamors of brighter light.

Our own observation of tho pheno- menon lends us to attribute it to the com- bined influence of an immense bush fire and a terrible dust storm. As we have said, a hot wind was blowing with tremendous forcef rom tho north, and it swirled up the dust in clouds, mingled it with tho smoko of a dis- tant fire, and so filled our atmosphere with tho lurid glare that at once attracted atten- tion and excited astonishment.
