tter I must give you some account of a number of old Catholic pioneer families who live in the neighbourhood of Rockhampton, with whom of course it was hardly possible for ' Kil leevy' to come into contact. And reverting to ' Killeevy' reminds me of an error he made by saying that Mr. E. V Reid was an Irishman, but not a Catholic. Mr. Reid is not only an Irishman, but a model Catholic besides. We had news yesterday that he was about to leave London by one of the P. and O. boats for Aus- tralia. The weather, which so far has been comparatively mild, is becoming rather hot. The country is very dry, and bushfires are numerous about the town.â€” November 4, 1898,
