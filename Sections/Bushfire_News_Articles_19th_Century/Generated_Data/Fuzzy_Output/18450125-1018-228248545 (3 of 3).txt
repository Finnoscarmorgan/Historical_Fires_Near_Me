Amongst other casualties, we have heard that at Mr. Austin's station at the Leigh, one of the shepherds was so severely scorched that he is not expected to recover, although he has been brought to Geelong for medical aid. At the same time forty sheep were killep by the flames. It. is reported that Mr. Carfrae of Lake Colac has lost no less than a thousand sheep from the same cause. The agriculturalist ought to guard against these fires with the greatest care, for he is still more liable to loss than the sheep farmer. His property lies within narrower bounds, and he can therefore the more easily provide for its safety ; but it would be vain for the squatters in many localities te attempt to arrest the course of the conflaguation, from the great extent of the boundary of their runs, and the luxuriance of the grass which during a hot wind will ignite with the slightest spark.
