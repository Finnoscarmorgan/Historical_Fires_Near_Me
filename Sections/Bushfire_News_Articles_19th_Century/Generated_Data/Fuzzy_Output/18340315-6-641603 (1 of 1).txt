FIRE. A BUSH-FIRE,—the dread of which has long haunted us—occasioned by the natives, but not with any malicious intent, on Thursday last, com- municated with a flat loaded with hay, which had been left secured in the rushes a short distance above the flats; in a few seconds the whole of the property in the flat was destroyed; which con- sisted of half a ton of flour, and 3 tons of hay, belonging to Mr. Gresswell, of Fremantle. The loss is considerable. The flat was the property of Mr. Tanner, known as his large flat, and was worth at least 60l. The flour at the present mar- ket price, may be estimated at 25l.
