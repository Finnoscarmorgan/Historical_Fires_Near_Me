ourse it may be concluded that fine gold has been lost, both in a state of amalgam with the quicksilver and otherwise. Too little skill and too much drink produce the worst results. Drink seems to be one of the worst of curses at Stringer's Creek. A number of men may be seen all day long playing at quoits in front of the shanties and public-houses. All the hills or ranges in the neighbour- hood of Stringer's Creek consist either of clay slate or sandstone. In some places, both are highly indurated. Where the sandstone is soft, a good soil has been formed, and it is covered either with scrub or, where bush-fires have destroyed the scrub, with grass and strong weeds. I may, in conclusion, remark that I have hitherto understood that Mount Useful was a hill of conglomerate. Such, however, is not the case. Masses of conglomerate exist on its flanks, but the western half of the mountain is composed of clay slate, nearly in a vertical position, and trending N. 42deg. W. ; whilst the eastern and more elevated half is com- posed of basaltic rock. But I must leave till another opportunity a description of this locality, and of the reefs of the neighbour- hood, so far as I have yet examined them.
