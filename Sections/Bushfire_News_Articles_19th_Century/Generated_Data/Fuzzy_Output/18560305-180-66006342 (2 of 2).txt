James Brown has been appoint- ed surrogate for granting marriage licenses; the ap pointment is, however, very recent, several applica- tions for licenses having been made some time ago, and the rev. gentleman had not then the power of granting them.

Martelli, Roman Catholic chaplain, is now in York, and I understand is likely to be per manently fixed here, it being long in contemplation by the members of that persuasion to erect a chapel and endow a clergyman. I am happy to state that we have not heard any thing in York of the destruction, by fire, of the pro- perty of our respected neighbour Mr J. Sewell, jun. we conclude, therefore, that the report must have arisen from something else. The statement appear- ed in the Gazette of Friday last February 23, 1856. â€”
