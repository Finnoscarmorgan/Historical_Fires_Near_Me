THR! T\'*CA\T1'KCTT A FLOATED. BRISBANE. October 5. News from Bowcn to-day states that an attempt which was made to refloat tlie -trÂ«uled steamer iniraciincka last night nrm-nil ineffectual, but that a further at tempt, made it high tide this morning, was mere successful. The steamer was taken into Bowen to coal, and if seaworthy she will most probably proceed direct to Syd ney. Captain Grahl, of the steamer Barcoo, which took tbe liastsengers and mails of the Intiiimincka, stated to-day that bushfires had been raging in the country along the coast between Mack'ay and Townsville, and the smoke on the coast was quite thick enough to embarrass one's judgment of dis tance. . _-?
