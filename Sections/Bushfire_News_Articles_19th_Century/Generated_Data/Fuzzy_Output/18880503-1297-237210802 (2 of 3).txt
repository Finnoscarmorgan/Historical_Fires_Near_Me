id to the communication. After some discussion, the following motion, moved by Mr. J. Kldle, of Walbnndrie, and seconded by Mr. E. J. Kernan, of Drumwood, was carried :— That provisions should be Inserted requiring per mission to be obtained from tho board to bnru off from October 1 to May 1 ; that M days' notice be given by advertisement of the intention to aopiy (or such permission. The penalty for any breach of this sec tion to be £100, or six months' imprisonment. The suggestion submitted by the Govern ment for drawing plough furrows around land whs considered ineffective, and the proposal that a Busbfire Brigade Bhould be formed was also regarded as ineffective, the board holding that .at present all neighbors would assist to extinguish fires likely to spread in the direc tion of thdir holdings without joining in a regularly-organised brigade, and that they would not be likely to do more than that if the brigade were formed. It was mentioned that the loss by the recent bushfires in this district could not be calculated at less than £10,000, and that their occurrence would considerably affect the prosperity of the district daring the forthcoming year.
