or even hand some villas, nestle among flowers, or under tall poplars, firs, or willows, suggesting happiness and peace; alas, not always pre sent where expected. At last we are in sight of the ridge that forms the watershed. We leave the devious road and make a straight cut up a shallow swampy dale. Here we find the first novelties for us, mind! Two or three lowly plants closely pi-essed to the ground; the one with rooting stems and branches, and partly submerged in water, turns out to be Tillaea intricata. Two others with similar habits, but under trees— where during the previous summer an in tense bushfire had raged so fiercely as to destroy almost all other germs of plants—are found to be Claytonia brevipedata (F. v. M.), with fleshy leaves, and Galium aperine, L. (?), the leaves of which are small and arranged in whorls of five or six, and in the axils of which the minute bluish white flowers peep forth, the plant forming dense cir cular pads several inches in diameter. At the ridge suddenly dense clamps of Banksia marginata appear among the taller cucalypts. On its stems the orange-colored Tremella mesenteria (a jelly like fungus forming intricate convolutions) is found, above an inch wide s
