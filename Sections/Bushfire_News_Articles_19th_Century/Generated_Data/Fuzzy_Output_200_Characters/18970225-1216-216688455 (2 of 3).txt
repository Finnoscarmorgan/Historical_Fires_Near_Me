TERRIBLE WEATHER. Fearfully hot weather was felt all over the colony to-day. The grass and crops are failing through want of rain, and bush fires are extensive. At Dungog an immense bushfire extended to the western portion of the town, and for two hours the town was in imminent danger. The fences of the hospital were destroyed and several buildings ignited were saved by the efforts of the townsmen. Thousands of acres of grass werÂ« burned aud miles of fencing destroyed. In the Maitland district considerable damage was done by bush fires.
