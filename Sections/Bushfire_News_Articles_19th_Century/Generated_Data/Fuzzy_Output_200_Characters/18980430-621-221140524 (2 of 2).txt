OUR LETTER BOX. . Enjoyable Holidays. — Yeo, Colac, 2Sili March, 1SSS. — Dear Uncle Ben, — "We live about .six miies from Colac, at Yeo. It is a very nice place and we get a beau- tiful view when on the hills. "We have had a. bad time of it here lately between the bushfires, -grasshoppers, and the dry- season. There is not a biade of green grass yet, through not having any rain. We aie getting pretty short of water for the stock. We got a great scare with a bushftre about a month ago. It came within a mile of us, and then the wind changed and stopped it quite suddenly. The grass-hoppers ate up everything that was in our garden, besides eating a lot of grass. They ate all the leaves off the fruit trees, which are cut in blos som again now. Fruit is a good price this year, although most of it is not very- good. My father, my brother, ana I spent our holidays at Ballarat, and we had a splendid time of it. We had a fine long drive going up, passing through Beech, Itolcewood, Cornidhap, Napo leons, Sebastopcfi, and Redan, and then io our grandmother's place.
