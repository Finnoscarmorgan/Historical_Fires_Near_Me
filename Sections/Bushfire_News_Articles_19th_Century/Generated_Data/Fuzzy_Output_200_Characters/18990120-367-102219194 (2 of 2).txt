delivered a very interesting and instructive address to a large and attentive audience in the Oldfellows' Hall, the subject being "England in 1897 and what I saw there." The address which lasted for nearly two hours, was illustrated by lantern views. At the close a hearty vote of thanks was ac- corded to the lecturer, also to Mrs. Kelloway, Mrs. Ranken, Mrs. Anderson, and other ladies who gave assistance. MINING.-Work has again commenced at the Bonarius mines under the management of Mr. S. Smith, and several men are being employed. Teams are also engaged drawing ore to the railway station. BUSH-FIRE -Bush-fires have been raging in various parts of the district and have done considerable damage. Among the heaviest losers are Mr. Edward Tickner of Wattle Vale, Jerrara, who has lost almost all his grass and fences, and Messrs. T. Latham and T. Shepherd, who have also lost some fences, and grass. The rain will check the progress of these fires.
