day the 7th instant, and had been engaged in felling timber for the embankment of a dam. On examination of the trees about where the body was found the conclusion was come to that deceased had first cut one pine-tree through, and this in falling had rested on the limb which afterwards killed him. He then appears to have cut another pine-tree to dic lodge the first, and falling in effecting the dislodge ment, had made up his mind to cut down the box- tree—marks of the axe being visible on it—when the limb must have given way. The body had a charred appearance which was accounted for by the fact that a bush-fire had been in the neighbourhood of the body, and the flames must have passed over it. The body of the unfortunate man was in a fearful state, the result of the action of the fire, the examination and handling of the body being a difficult and most painful duty.
