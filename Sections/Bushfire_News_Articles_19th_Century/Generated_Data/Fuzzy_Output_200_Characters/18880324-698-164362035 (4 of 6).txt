We are still having a dry time, and thingp would be much better if we had a nice fall of rain. About this district we have had our share of bush fires, and some selections have suffered by loss of grass and fencing. On some of the runs, too, a good deal of fencing has been destroyed. This is the usual penalty for abundance of dry feed. It is difficult to advance a cause for these fires, and ie peculiar manner they originate, sometimes in different directions, leads up to the opinion that carelessness is not the cause. Fortunately feed is abundant, but rain hanging off so persistently does not make things look too well, ana the long dry grass which has been consumed would have stood to stock splendidly 6hould the winter not be favorable.
