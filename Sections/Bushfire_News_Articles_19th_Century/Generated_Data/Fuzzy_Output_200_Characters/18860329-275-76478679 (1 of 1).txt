is to be hoped that Mr. Withers may boo his way lo remain nnioug us, aud that ho will bo content to wait for 'tho good times coming.' The aerated water manufactory of Messrs, I1. & C. Piesso is in full SAving, and it is iioav our privilege to obtain a supply of really good aorated waters at Perth prices. Mr, May (Mr, Hordern's surveyor) has gob as far as tho Crossumu River, Avhoro ho is surveying sonic poison land. I believo ho intends going as far back as the 80-mile, but uo farthor. Some of tho land, notably tho block betweon Bannister station and Wandering, contains some nieo patches of good soil. Bush-fires have been very severe. One settler, Mr. John Stevens, sustained damage to the estimated amount of Â£1,000. Others have suffered by the Ioss of fences, runs, &c.; The loss to stock and sheep will doubtless be heavy, as nearly all the runs have been burnt, and, consequently, young poison is springing up abundantly.
