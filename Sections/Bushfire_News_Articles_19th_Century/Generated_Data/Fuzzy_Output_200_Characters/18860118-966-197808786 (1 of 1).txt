FIRE AT PORT VINCENT.—We are informed that on Friday last Mr. W. T. Waterhouse's residence at Port Vincent was completely destroyed by fire, A bushfire had been iaging in the neighbourhood, but it was believed to be extinguished, and between 2 and 3 o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Waterhouse and family, seeing that everything was safe, went to the beach for a bathe. On their return they found their house razed to the ground, and all their belongings consumed. It is believed that a whirlwind swept up some living embers from some distance away and deposited them on the building which, being of wood, quickly caught alight with the result already mentioned. Much sympathy is felt for Mr. Waterhouse, as he is only partially insured. LOCAL COURT AT HERGOTT.—T
