y of notice: the natives must, and will, have fire to cook and steep by, and the only means they have of carrying fire is by lighting two or three pieces of bark, which they hold in their hand like a torch. Now what can be more dangerous than this in the summer, when the grass and every thing is as dry as tinder; let them be ever so carefu1, it is almost impossible for them to prevent the bush taking light. To prevent this, I would propose '.hat the Govern ment do issue to the head of every aboriginal family one box of matches every month. Thip, I think, would have great tendency towards stopping the bush-fires, and at a very trifling expense to the Government. I remain, Sir, yours very obliged, A York Settler. York, June 10, 1850.
