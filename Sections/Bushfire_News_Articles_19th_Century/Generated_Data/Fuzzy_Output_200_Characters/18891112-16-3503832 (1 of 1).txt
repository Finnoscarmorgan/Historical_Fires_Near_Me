d with Mitchell, blue, and Flinders grasses, studded with pebbly ridges lightly timbered with white wood and bimerah, the river frontage being heavily timbered with good useful timber for building and fencing purposes. There are now eighteen paddçoks containing togother an area of about 380,000 acras enclosed by substantial sheoep-proof fencing, and it is a pleasure to see fencing kept in such admirable repair. Some of this, which Mr. Bartlam informed me was erected last year, struck me as being the most suitable sheep fence I havd seen for this country where timber is scarce, carriage expensive, and bush-fires prevalent. There are 110 boree posts 4in. in diameter and 330 iron standards 11/4in. by 3/4in. to the mile. The boree posts are sunk 2ft. in the ground (strainers 3ft.), and the iron stan- dards, 12ft. apart, are driven with a sledge- hammer 181n. into the ground. The standards are punched for six wires. This fence cost £38 per mile, and the boree posts had to be carted from twoenty to twenty-five milos. I expect to see fencing of this class largely adopted on the Downs sheep stations where timber is so scarce. All the paddocks, except those on the Flinders frontage, which have permanent ho
