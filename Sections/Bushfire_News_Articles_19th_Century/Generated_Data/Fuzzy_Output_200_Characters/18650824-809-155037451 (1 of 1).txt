And hero attention might bo drawn to tho circumstance how wood ushes, immediately after bushfires, whorover ranges are near, could profitably bo collected.

For root-crops especially, an application of potash to the soil will always prove of great benefit. Though tho quantities of potash is varyiug in different plants lo somo extent, according to the mineral constituents of tho spot, it will bo of in terest to observe that tho results of tho cxamina tioH of some specimens, kindly contributed by Mr Johnson, proves a
