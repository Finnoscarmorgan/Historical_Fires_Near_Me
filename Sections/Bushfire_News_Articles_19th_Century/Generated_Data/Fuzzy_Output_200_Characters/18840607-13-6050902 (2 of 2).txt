crub springing luxuriantly, and may conclude from this that within the last few years a bush-fire has swept across this part of the country. Wattle scrub is brought into existence by influences just the opposite of those that induce the growth of other trees. The seed of most of our forest trees germinates when a sufficiency of moisture is provided, but excessive heat is the raison-d'etre for the wattle. The black seeds, which seem to retain their ger- minating power for many years, are preserved in the mould, without being in any way affetted by ordinary climatic conditions. But the fierce heat of a bush fire cracks the hard outer casing of the seed and in the fol- lowing spring the young trees cover the land thickly, where, perhaps, for half a century the air has never been sweetened with the fragrance of a wattle blossom.
