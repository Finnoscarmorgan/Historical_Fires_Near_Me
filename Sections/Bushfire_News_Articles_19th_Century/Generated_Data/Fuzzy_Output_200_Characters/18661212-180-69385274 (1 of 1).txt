Mr. Thomas Wilding is sow erecting a fine steam floor-mill in this township, which was much required, and when completed, will prove of much benefit and convenience to the inhabitants. Oar harvest prospects are good, and some of the farmers near Newcastle have already reaped a few acres of the most forward crops. * A few days since a bush-fire occurred, homing Mr., Dempster's run, and doing considerable injury to the wheat-crop of two small farmers named Perry and Hoddie. The latter had also several tons of hay consumed by the devouring, element. I am happy to report a better sociable feeling in Northam than existed some months since, which, allow me to say, your own columns, by correcting abases, greatly contributed in bringing about. Northam, Bee. 1.
