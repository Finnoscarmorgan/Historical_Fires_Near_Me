He ex presses himself satisfied that deforesting has not the effect of diminishing rainfall. The influence which bush fires exercise prior to settlement is made the subject, of some very interesting remarks: â€” 'Most of us know tie great alteration which a bush fire makes in the tract burnt. The coarser undergrowth is destroyed and does not reappear for a long period of time, and the annnal and herbaceous plants have a better chance of flourish ing in such an area the next spring.
