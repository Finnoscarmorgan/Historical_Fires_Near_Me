The losses ?which have taken' place in the colony from fluke during the last fifteen years have been enormous, aud on many runs the deaths of sheep are iu advance of the number of lambs weaned. 11. No cure for fluke is known; but drainage, the avoidance of swampy pasturage, a plentiful allowance of tiutritious food (the restoration of our better grasses), with a full supply of ; salt, will certainly bring the evil within very narrow limits. 12.
