o the subduing of the wide spread conflagration. A portion of Mr Dowsett'e crop, near the rail wayv was accidentally fired on the same day, by the sparks from a pa'sning locomotive enging, 16 was, however, soon subdued. A considerable brish fire also raged at some distance from Kyne toii, in the direction of Kangaroo Creek. We ,hayG not received any particulars from that ; quarter. The total loss from bush fires during the '.past fortnight, in this district, must be very consid erable. We hear that Messrs Ewart and Shepherd i son's ' Saw 'Mills; situated in the Seven-mile 'Forest, were destroyed by a bush fire on WedneB jday.1 'The' water-wheel' was saved by the water jb'eing turned upon it; and : the steatn engine was ?also got- out: Several cottages adjacent to the jmill were destroyed. - Accounts have reached us lof the destruction of some 300 acres of ^yariqus 'erops oh the Loddbn,' belonging: to Mr Btyden. ;The bush fires in the KLynetoh District are, still, 'raging; even as we go to press, pillars of smoke imay be seen rising in different quarters'.— -Kyneton \Guardian,' San.
