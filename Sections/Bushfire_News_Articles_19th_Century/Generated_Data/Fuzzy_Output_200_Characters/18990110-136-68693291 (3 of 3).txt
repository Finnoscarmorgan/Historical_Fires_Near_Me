 this number will shortly be largely increased, as the farm is well adapted for dairying, there being abundance of grass and water. Among other experiments Mr. Crisp tried hop- growing some years ago on the site of his orchard, and the quality of the article produced was pronounced by good judges to be equal to anything grown in the colony. About two acres were devoted to hop-growing, but after a few years trial, it was found that the returns were not sufliciently remunerative, and Mr. Crisp aban- doned its cultivation; but not before he had the misfortune to have all one season's crop destroyed by a bush fire after it had been picked, which means a very serious loss. Elizabeth Creek — a fair-sized stream — runs through Applegrove farm, and on the north bank, on Mr. Crisp's property, a brown coal seam has been found, from which about 50 tons was taken some years ago and sent to Melbourne for the purpose of being tested. The seam is 40ft thick, and the soil is somewhat darker than the Morwell brown coal. Mr. Stirling, the Government Geologist, expressed an opinion that the quality would improve as it went down ; but, as it would be expensive and difficult to cart the coal to Thorpdale, the mine has
