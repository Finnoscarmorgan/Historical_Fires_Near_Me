 are held together by tough rope-like-stems of climbers. Most of the larger trees possess great spurs or flanges at their base. The faller surmounts these obstacles by a slight staging 8ft or 10ft. high. When scrub-falling, the fallers need a liberal supply of food, and usually have meals four times a day-at 6 o'clock in the morning, at 11, at 3, and at dusk. The scrub is fired about Christmas, or before sum- mer rains set in. There is no fear of the fire overlapping the fallen dry scrub. The avenues of the scrub, with their wealth of green foliage, cannot he penetrated by the fire-fiend, therefore a bush-fire is unknown in virgin scrub, and consequently such a place is an excellent collecting-ground for a lichen- ologist or other such collector.
