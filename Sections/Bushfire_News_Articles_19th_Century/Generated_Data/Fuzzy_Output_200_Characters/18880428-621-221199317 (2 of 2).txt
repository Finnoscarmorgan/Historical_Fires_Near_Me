e destroyed. There are several raoges in. the direction of Lome, upon which all- the young timoer was hopelessly destroyed bv those fires, which -ccnld nnh hÂ« checked, as much on account of the immense quaniity of dead timber lying about the ground as anything else. But for this timber, much of which had been left scattered about by splitters and others, there is every reason to believe that the fires would not have been anything like as destructive or widespread as they were. A scheme, therefore, which would prevent, to a very large extent, timber from being scattered so carelessly about as food for bueh fireB,. should be of great service in these parts, i am pleased to observe the increasing interest that is being taken in the subject, and feel sure that, now that the importance of conserving the timber in our State forests as mqch as ie practically possible Is realised nearly everywhere, such steps will be taken, and, especially for the protection of young trees, that there will be ever growing up in our forest quite sufficient young timber to take the place of chat which willof necessity b a removed from time to time.
