Three fires have occurred during the past week, for which no cause is assigned, except in one case at Meckering, where the fire was due to a severe whirlwind which was seen to encircle hay-stack, which immediately burst into flames.

The sufferers are Mrs. Jessie Hammond, resident at Seabrook, who lost about ten tons of chaff already bagged and sundry improvements; Mr. Fred. Combly, Meckering, who had sixteen, tons of hay, sheds and implements destroyed; and Mr. Charles Matthews, Northam, who had 40 tons of hay and stables burned.
