presented a very striking appearance lately, although at present we have the Forget-me-Not, Flying Foam, Argo, and Arabian ; but as the only colonial produce we have for shipment is sand, there is no inducement for coasters to visit us, as most of them are obliged to return to Fre- mantle in ballast. The Forget-me-Not has made a trip to Port Gregory since arriving from Fremantle, aad returned with 95 tons of lead ore. - : There are three cases for the sessions on Wednes- day, the worst ot which is for the murder of Messrs. Brown's native (Charlie). We have had some very seasonable weather lately, and bush-fires have been burning in all directions, but I have not heard of any serious losses from them. We decidedly want something to stir us up here. I think if the Galatea had called in it would have had the desired effect (at least, it appears to have done so in Perth and Fremantle). Between those that did go to the ball, and those that did mot, it appears to be stirring times, but I believe that 'after a storm comes a calm.' Geraldton, Feb. 28.
