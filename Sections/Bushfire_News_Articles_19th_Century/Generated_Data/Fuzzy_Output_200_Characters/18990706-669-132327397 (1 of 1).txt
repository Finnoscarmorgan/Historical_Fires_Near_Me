an enlightened system of local government. In -New Zealand local governing bodies are established through out the whole colony. Even South Aus tralia, 'where there is still a greab area un incorporated, is immeasurably in advance of New South Wales, for, in the settled portions of tho province, local govern ment prevails, and the district councils have the control of such matters as public health, roads, dog registration, rabbit and thistle extermination, pound keepers, unleased Grown lands, drainage, lire brigades, weights and measures, slaughter-houses, sale of foods, drugs and poisons, cemeteries, bushfires act, width of tyres, lights on vehicles, game acts, lodging-houses, fisheries, brands, orna mental grounds and places of public amusement acb. It stands to reason that such matters as these can be better attended to by local authorities than by the State Legislature, and ib is much to bo desired that the worthy examplelongsince shown by the younger colonies may be followed by New South Wales without further unnecessary delay.
