ll the ground is thickly covered with a coating of leaves full of potass and organic matter, forming, before their decay, a warm covering to proteot the perennial horb age from froBt, and afterwards supplying a rich tap-dreBsinglof leaf-mould, superior ta all other manure- Now, in the forest lands wbero this rich top-dressing has been annually repeated for centuries-aye, for thousands of years, it is easy to perceivo that the land must be very different from that in any part of Australia, whero wo have .only a scanty supply of potass from the annual shedding of the gum- tree bark, and from occasional bush-fires. As soon as the Ameri- can farmer can get hfs plough among the tree-stumps in his clearing, his rich leaf mould soil will at once yield him ample orop√§, for the plant-food Is already prepared; but it is not so In Australia, whero thero is soldom. if ever, any leaf-mould soil ; and where a field has been cleared and burnt off, the first crop here is almost uniformly very patchy and un- equal-the thin patches Indicating a defi- ciency of potass to dissolve the quartz-sand, which has only been well effected in spots where the burning of the stump3 has set free the potass in tho timber and in t
