e reaped corn in the field. Cross-examined by the prisoner — People may be stock- hunting in the neighbourhood, and they might not be seen. William Fred. Seymour deposed — I am a small farmer at Dunsbro', Vasse. I had in January a small crop of wheat at Kungenup. The prisoner Targett was in my service. I had him assisting in carting and fencing in that neighbourhood. I went home, leaving Targett to reap the wheat. I returned to my house at Donsbro' about 8 o'clock at night. I saw the prisoner, who told me that my wheat at Kungenup had been burnt. I asked him how it came there. He said that he saw the bush- fire coming towards the field, and afterwards come down the hill like a racehorse. The wheat runs along the hill. He did not say that he had lost anything. I went to Kungenup. I saw that a great deal of the wheat had been burnt, and but few patches of standing corn remained. At the place where he said the fire came in like a racehorse, there were no signs of the fire having come in that direction. I saw several places where it had been attempted to fire the bush outside the field, and many burnt rushes. The hut is at the other side of the gully. William Curtis deposed — I am a farmer at Cape Nat
