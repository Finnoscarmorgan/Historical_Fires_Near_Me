These fires not only consume the trees which are still left standing, but they also destroy the young saplings, which, if preserved, would in the course of a few years replace the trees which had been cut down, and would thus restore the forests to their original wooded condition. Even where fires do not take place, the ground being littered with the refuse, branches and brushwood, the young saplings are choked in their growth, and all restitution of the forest is clothing. thus put a stop to as completely as if a bush-fire had [passed over the locality..
