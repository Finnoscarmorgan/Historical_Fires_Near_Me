The passengers having all alighted, and the remaining three horses unharnessed, the guard and driver, with the assist- ance of sovoral gentlomen passengers, raised tho coach with a number of slip-rail levers, and backed it free from the fallen animal, who immediately rose with' no moro formidable injury than a slightly scratched knee.
