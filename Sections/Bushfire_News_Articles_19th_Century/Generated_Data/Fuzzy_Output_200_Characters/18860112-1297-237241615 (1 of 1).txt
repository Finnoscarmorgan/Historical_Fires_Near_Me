 Leiehhardt, and lie possibly lias more information than we are possessed of, it would be satisfnotor y before passing judgment to know of what the remains consist. Are thoy actual remains of theexplorer himself, or have ourold friends thu relies turned up again I It seouis scarcely likely that human remains could be left uu- buricd in the hush for so long a time und es cape destruction, and that in a country where so much prospecting lias been done as the Cloneurry.
