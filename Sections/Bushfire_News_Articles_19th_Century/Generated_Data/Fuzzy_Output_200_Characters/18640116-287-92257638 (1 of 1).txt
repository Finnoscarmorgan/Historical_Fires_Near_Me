o me about 9 a.m., and told me of what had occurred. I sent all hands on the station to ;the fire. We were two days and nights in trying to put it out. Asked Gostello how it occurred, and he said the same as he has already explained to tbe jury. I have visited the place since, and can trace no origin of the fire. It was extinguished by the help of the settlers. The quantity of graBS consumed was from 13 to 14 miles iu length and 6 or 1 in width. Cannot tell as yet how many sheep were destroyed. There has been another fire since, which burned about a square mile of feed. We have no means of preventing bush- fires. The Coroner left the matter with the jury, who returned a verdict 'That the fire originated from accident and not otherwise, and no one was to blame in the matter.'
