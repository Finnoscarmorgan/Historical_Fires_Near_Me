cate .to the use of the public, without the slightest consideration, a road cutting his. freehold land in twp ?" The fact that be had placed placards up on his land, cautioning trespassers, , was sufficient evi dence that he had not dedicated the road to the, .public. He said that he never granted the use of the road to the public. The. freehold was fenced in, and in 1880 a bush-fire burned the fences. New fencing , was erected, and completed in April, 1881 ; and during that time the public travelled aoross the paddock. So they would see that it. was , not Mr Fergusen who opened the land ; it was the bush-fire. There was therefore no evidence of leave and license, and aiso 110 evideuce'qf dedication. Then what didthecase ampunt to ? Plaintiff lost ten head . of cattle, " valued at Â£6 per head. Strange cattle had eaten bis grass; but he could not claim for tliat, as it was not men tioned in the declaration. He had been scarcely fairly treated, in his evidence on tho question of loss not having been chal- lenged, although the other side were afforded every opportunity of doing so, had they so wished. A more unsatisfactory lot of witnesses had never been produced for the defence in a curt of justice.
