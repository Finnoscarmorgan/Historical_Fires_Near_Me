yed on Thursday. Mr. Frazer's mill only escaped through the exer tions of the workmen, aided by a number of men from Anderson's mill. Several huts close to the mill were burnt, and the build ings over the Try Again Company's claim were with difficulty saved from a similar fate through the exertions of the mining manager." The Pleasant Creek News reports that a party of miners working on the Ironbark Ranges suffered a heavy loss by a bushfire on Friday. They had left work the previous day, and as usual had lowered all the tools down the shaft, leaving the rope on the windlass: During their absence the bushfire reached the place. A brush miamia, which had been erected for its shade, was an easy prey for the flames, and as the shaft was well " logged up"' the logs and windlass were soon blazing merrily. As they burnt they slipped out of position and fell down the shaft, where they and the tools, rope, &e.;, were all burning when the miners arrived. So utterly was the face of the country changed that they had some diffi culty in finding their claim, and when they did so it was only to find their entire mining plant destroyed, and flames almost filling the shaft as they rushed up from the blazing heap
