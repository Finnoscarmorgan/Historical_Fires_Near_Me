ve received the current number of the A uslralasian Sketcher, which is as interesting ns usual. The “ Monster fish at the bow of the steamer Wakatipa,” “A hot corner,” the " Phoenix Company’s Foundry, Ballarat,” ” Scenes from ‘ Youth’ at the Theatre Royal,” and ” The Victorian Naval Reserve,” are among the best of the illustrations. In the scene at sea a portion of the monster fish is represented as pressing against tho bow of the vessel, while the sailors are getting ready to try to secure the monstrosity. “A hot corner,” is a fearful sketch of a spot into which a mob of horses have been driven by a bushfire, their progress being arrested by a post and rail' fence, and tho flames bursting up around them. The picture of the Phoenix Foundry works ia quite realistic, and pour trays in an admirable manner a variety of operations in progress in the interior of the establishment. There are several other good engravings in the number, the “ Bicycle race meeting ” supplying a racy sketch in the hum ourous line.
