The crops are consequently thin, light, and smothered with weeds ; the yield under such conditions could not be otherwise than low.

The country is covered with grass to a greater depth than ever knovm ; the danger from bush-fires has correspondingly increased, but though a few have been started in Riverina as we 1 as in this colony, thty have fortunately been mas tered before they attained ft serious magnitude; the danger, however, will not be past for another six or eight weeks.
