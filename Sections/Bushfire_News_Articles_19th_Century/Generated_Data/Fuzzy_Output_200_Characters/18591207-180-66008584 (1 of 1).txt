, In every age, in every clime The willing slave of vice and crime, No more can check his vile desires Than wood can stay the summer fires: Then lift thy voice to Heaven in prayer, There yet is peace for sinners there â€” Pour out thy soul to God above. For he is still a God of love: And as the smoking lines of fire, Quench'd by the dewy night, expire, His grace shall melt thy heart of stone, And give thee feelings not thine own. The sway of angry passions fied, By faith and new obedience led, Regenerate spiritual life Shall soon succeed to stormy strife: So waving herbage, fresh and green, Repairs the bush-fire's raging scene.
