When these peaty swamps become thoroughly dry, unless means are used to flood them, in cnse of a general bush-fire, some of the farmers will one day And themselves minus their area. Had these swamps been left to nature, the pent would continue growing until it would attain to the wntcr-level, tho mollusca could proceed no further, the subsequent increment would be pure loam, free from tho caloarlons element, nnd ready for the growth of timber, &o;, I regard these peaty swamps as coal in its earliest Btnge of formation, but aÂ» the theory of conl formations, as as taught by geologists, is well known to your leaders, eaoh may mentally carry out the pro cess, nnd ncoopt or rejuot the idea as suits him.
