aint the million shapes And unimaginable freaks of Fire, When holding thus its monster carnival In the primeval forest, all night long? NOTE.â€”The descriptive detail of the text may appear overcharged to all those persons who have only witnessed such Bush Fires as occur on our ordinary commons. But in the earlier colonial times, before the wilderness generally was so thickly stocked with cattle as even the remotest locations are at present, our natural grasses attained to the height of five and six feet, and several kinds of spear-grass (or grass trees) even to double that height; and this gave to the Bush Fires of those times a character alto- gether tremendous in comparison to any affairs of the kind that may be seen now-a-days within the compass of at least three or four hundred miles. It has been my fortune, however, to have witnessed several very great ones, and I have thrown together in the poem the more striking aspects and circumstances of each and all of them.
