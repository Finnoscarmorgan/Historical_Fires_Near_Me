Bush Fires. Small bush fires were burning to the north east of Goulburn on Monday evening, and the flames were distinctly visible. Reports have reached us of most destructive fires in the Crook well district. One, which took its rise near Junction Point on Sunday, is said to have extended right to Laggan, a distance of some 30 miles, doing considerable damage. The residents near Binda have also suffered heavy damage from bush fires, it being reported that some of the settlers have been burnt out, and that the fire is extending in the direction of Crookwell.
