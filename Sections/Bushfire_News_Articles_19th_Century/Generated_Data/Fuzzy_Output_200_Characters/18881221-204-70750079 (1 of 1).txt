LENEVA. (FROan OUR OWN\ COItRESPONDNST.) No bushfires this week, I am luhappy to: say, but something hetter-somoething - which has refreshed the worn-out fire bjaters, and has proved a killing superior to the monsteru which has boon doerns tating our surrounding ranges lately. Weo have at last been blessed with a down-.. lpur, of the long-looked-for rain, which. will dol an iSmolenso amount of good to. the tobacco and other crops, and will fairly be the making of the grape crops. A well-kno'wn' sayisg runs thus:-" It is. an ill wind that blows nobody any good;'" but it sioms to'melit is im oextraordinarily good wind that blows nobody any harm.
