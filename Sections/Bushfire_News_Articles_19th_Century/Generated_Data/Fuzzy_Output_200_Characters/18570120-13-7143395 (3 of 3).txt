 last the hot winds were insufferable, and the bush must have been very ignitable. It is with great regret we have to record the loss, by Mr. Cochrane of a field of wheat and some oats. Mr. Dugald M'Pherson has been burnt out. Mr. McLeod and Mr. Purrier have also lost large portions of their crops. Miss Gavin, at Mount Piper, had her crops burnt, the last year's hay, oats, and wheat in stack, and much fencing. Others have been sufferers, but not to such an extent as the above. Mr. Andrew Beveridge, of Woodburn, has also been a sufferer ; his wheat crop, stable, and out-houses have been destroyed by a bush-fire which started in that neighbourhood on Mon- day last. Parties camping should be com- pelled to extinguish their fires during sum- mer. We have no doubt this latter destruc- tion arose from several camp fires, left by bullock-drivers on the Kurkurruc Creek, which we saw burning on Saturday morning last.â€”Kilmore Examiner.
