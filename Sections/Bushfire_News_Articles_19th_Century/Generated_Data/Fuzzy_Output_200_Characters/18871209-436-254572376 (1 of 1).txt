LATER YER0NG CREEK ITEMS. (FEOM A COBBBSPONDENT.) The gauge registers an inch of rain for the week. The weather is at present very boisterous, though fine. Several bush-fires have broken out in the district, but fortunately no great damage has been done as yet. Our enterprising townsman Mr. Plunkett has organised a day's sports on the 26th January. The programme includes a Â£30 Sheffield Handicap, which should entice a goodly number of runners. The children of the public school are a]pl to have a picnic at an early date. Their energetic, teacher, Mr. Bickerstaff, evidently has their welfare at heart, and will leave no stone unturned to make the affair a success. I have not yet learned the exact date of the feast.
