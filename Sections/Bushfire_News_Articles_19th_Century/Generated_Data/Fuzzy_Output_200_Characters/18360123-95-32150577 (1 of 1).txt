 endeavours to gain such inform- tion as will enable him to make choice of an allot- ment altogether suitable to his peculiar views. The nature of the Territory and the consequent mode or location almost preclude the possibility, and in reality render it useless, to mark the section lines on the ground as in Canada. Even in parts of the Colony (as in the County of Bathurst) which, on being first opened, were partially surveyed with a view to location, it is found that allotments ap- plied for in terms, of the previous admeasurement, have to be surveyed afresh. The natural growth of the timber and the bush-fires soon obliterate the labours of the Surveyor, and would render futile, therefore, any minute survey of the General Terri- tory previous to selection.
