of my tent, which was the furthest out. Our camp being safe 1 started with six men for Major O'Hallornn's, as the five was very rapidly progressing in his direction. We went at the double, and arrived there just in time. It was no easy job to keep the wooden buildings from catching fire, for pieces of burning twigs would fly aeross ocasionally from the she oak trees which were blazing a short dis tance away. What with heating the fire hack in one direction and setting fire to the grass to meet it in another we managed to save the place. Jn after years the Major would often, when we met, refer to this hush fire, and say "If it had not been for you and your men my homestead would have been utterly destroyed, and myself and fa mily placed in a position attended with great risk to our lives." About a mue and a half away from our then camp was one occupied by seve ral passengers of tbe Surry ship, and they were also in great danger from the tire, so a strong party of our men started to render assistance. The grass was short in that locality, so that the fire was not so furious, and the camp was saved. The oc cupants' had been in a great fright, and were much relieved when our men arrived.
