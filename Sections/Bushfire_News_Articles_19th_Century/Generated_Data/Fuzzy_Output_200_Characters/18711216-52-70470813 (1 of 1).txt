GRENFELL. December 12. TUE heat has at last subsided, rain sot in last night, though not continuous but at short intervals. If it so continues, it will cool the air, extinguish the bush-fires, and otherwise effect immeasurable benefits to the district, if not the colony at large. During the adjudication of Mr. F Dalton, P.M. on, Tues day last, in divers mining disputes, had occasion to com ment upon tho inaccurate nature of the entries in the Mining Register, and stated that the books of registration ought to bo carefully kept, as they aro tho only reliable sourco to prove or trace ownership. Mr. Dalton has conferred a great boon upon mining communities by awaking attention in this direction, and it is hoped that all benches will not falito push matters into the proper channol.
