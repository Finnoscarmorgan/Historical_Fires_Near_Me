the tug which took the ship through Port Phillip Heads remembered noticing that the vessel had a pair of headbords on her bows when he parted from her. Another board, having the name Sobraon cut on it, was picked up on Saturday on the beach to the eastward of Cape Douglas, and it is very probably the companion headboard to the one found near Portland.

Co., while endeavoring to survey a track along which to bring in the machinery, lost his way. It appears that the smoke from the bush-fires was so dense that he was unable to see where be was going. After being in the bush three days his horse knocked up, and being very hungry, and seeing no other way to get food, he killed 'the horse and cut off about 30 pounds of flesh, and started on foot. Happily for him, he fell in with an old man, who directed him to his home. He was, I am told, in a fearful state, and entirely exhausted from the exertions he made up hill and down, to discover some track that would lead him out of difficulty.
