The fire was pursuing a direction in which there are few or no houses ; but there is much reason to fear that, from the causes before alluded to, the sphere of its destructive influence may be extended, while the slightest change of wind may carry it in a direction where it may produce incalculable injury. All those who have a low and inflam- mable scrub in the vicinity of their habitations should lose no time in preparing for the fearful visitation of a bush fire. A little exertion at the present time may perhaps save them from utter ruin a month hence.
