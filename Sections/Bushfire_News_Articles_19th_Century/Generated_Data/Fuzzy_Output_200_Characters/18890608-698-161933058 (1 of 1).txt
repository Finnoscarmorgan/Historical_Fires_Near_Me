WAGGA WAGGA, June 3. The pastoralists are all in raptures. There has not been too much rain for them ; indeed, they predict that next spring will be tbe grandest ever seen in the Mur rumbiugee district. Will they cut and ensilage the rank growth of surplus grass or leave it to feed bush fires ? is asked on all sides.. The stock sates iu this diBtrict.are now reverting to their old style in the best seasons, and one is quoted as a fair example. During tho last week J. B. Wood and Co. sold 13,000 ewe hoggets for Robert Rand,' Mahonga'; 5000 8-tooth wethers for William Wood, Benambra*; 3000 2-tooth ewes for G. J. Mulholland, Oura ; and 6000 wether hoggets for G. P. Wilson, Big Springs, at such high prices that, if anyone could have foretold the rain a couple of months ago, and purchased the lot, he could now retire upon a very fair little income. Stock are moving in all directions,
