fires on the Peninsula. A eoi respondent, writing from Port Vincent under date January 14, says:â€”"Near Port Vincent large bush-fires nave been raging for two or three days, endangering crops and other property. Valuable feed has been destroyed on Mr. Waterhouse's section, and at one time fears were entertained for his house. The fire is now worst in the scrub between that section and Stans bury, and is burning in several places very fiercely and making westerly. The origin of the fire is believed to be the careless throwing away of a lighted match by a passing smoker.
