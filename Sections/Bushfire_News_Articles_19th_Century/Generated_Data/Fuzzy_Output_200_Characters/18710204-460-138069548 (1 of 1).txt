In'no previous seasoh have the rye grass pastures thrown so fine a yield as in the present one, and owing to the abundance of the feed, the live-stock has interfered but little with the seed stems. Thus the ground is literally'covered with seed; which, it is to be hoped, will lie secure until the autumn, when dewy nights and a lower temperature, even though unaccompanied by a copious rainfall, will afford it a fair chance of grow ing and becoming established. The showers that have freshened the young growth of rye grass have rendered the old wordless as feed, but should it escape bush-fires, it will fonri a most valuable mulching, and pro duce an effect on the winter pastures such as Victorian farmers have little concep tion of.
