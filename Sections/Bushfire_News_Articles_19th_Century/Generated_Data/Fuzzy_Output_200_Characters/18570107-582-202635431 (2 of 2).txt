 The cause of quarrel will likely be in quired into to-day. A new rush has taken place on Manchester Flat, close to the roadside. One parly last' Friday bottomed a shaft, and washed 3 ozs- off the bottom. Yesterday others had bot tomed, and were washing fromadwt. to a quarter of an ounce ; others had sunk shicers. - The ground is wet. It is reported that a party of Chinese obtained 67 ounces last week, out of a paddock in the bed of the creek, at the west of Turk's Hill. A party of Englishmen worked all last week close to the same spot, and scarcely made more than a bare living. The Bush Fires. — The bush-fires on Friday and Saturday seem to have extended to all portions of the district round Ballarat. Buninyong forest to the sou'h was blazing away at a fearful rate. In the agricultural district to the north and west, besides the damage done on or near Messrs. Rankin and Douglas's farm, there was a large ex tent of ground under fire in the neighbourhood of Coghill's station, and it was generally rumoured on Saturday that at Clunes there had been serious damage done, and that some of the out-buildings at the home station had been burned down. — > Ballarat Star.
