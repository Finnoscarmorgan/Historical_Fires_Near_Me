Goodwin as revenue officer at t√Æiis place. Bush- fires are playing sad havoc in the ranges around Toongabbie by destroying the iiard-earned property of the splitters, there being large quantities of sleepers, posts, and piles, in the bush. Bash-fire.- mean ruin to these men, although sometimes they are the result of their oxn carelessness. Nor do the selectors and land-owners escape the ravages of fire, ami frequently fences, homesteads, and property to tbe extent of hundreds of pounds worth, are destroyed. The careless use of fire can not be too strongly condemned at this season of the year. There is to be a public meeting here on Tuesday 2is
