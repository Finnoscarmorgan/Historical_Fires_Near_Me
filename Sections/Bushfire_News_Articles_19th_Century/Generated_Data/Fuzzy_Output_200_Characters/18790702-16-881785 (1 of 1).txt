PORT CURTIS. June l8. The season continues to be exceptional ia character, a moderate rainfall at short interval» having been the rule now for many months past. As a matter of course, with Buch a season th« country looks its best, water being very plentiful everywhere, and grass long, abundant, and too green to burn. Hardly a bushfire worthy of th« name has been seen this year anywhere in this neighborhood. The most astonishing feature of the season throughout bas been the frequency of rain and the absence of floods. Stock and station matters have as yet under- gone no change since my last. Signs of im- provement are, it is thought, appearing, as som« station properties are now under offer and in* spection, and business is expected to result tliorefrem. Some Bhow at anyrate of returning confidence is being manifested by stockowner», still as yet there is no improvement in prices; and sales are very hard to effect ; £3 10s.
