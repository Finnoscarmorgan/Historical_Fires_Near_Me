ound thom aro illuminated by an advancing line of fire extending for miles ; leaving behind it thou- sands ot blazing logs which light up th land- scape so as to make it present tho appearance of an iiu menso city after nightfall. Wo are sorry to say most of these fires are the result of gross carolessnew. Wo look upon tho mon who starts a bush fire as being equally cri- minal with the man who thrusts a firestick into tho fanner's haystack. The grasB is tho sole dependence of the grazier ; it is as voluablo to him as the standing wheat crop is to tho agriculturist. Moreover thero is no saying where a bush- fire may stop. It may sweep over the country for scores of mike, and it changes its direction with the ever-varying changes in the wind. Perhaps by great exertions a num- ber of people may beat it out, but it usually bursts forth, ngain two or three days afterwards to scattor fresh dosola tien around. Of course when tho grass is dry as tinder, fires may bo accidentally caused. Tho friction of dry branches agitated by tho breeze, against ono another, or the concentration of the sun's rays into a focus through thO' bottom of o broken bottle-causes Uko these have boon, known to pioduco bush-fires.
