forts to save buildings in the vicinity proved of great value for had it not been for their attendance Miss Walker's cottage in Riverstone Park must have been demolished. The fireman remained in attendance, at the direction of Captain Wallace, till a late hour last evening. The difficulty experienced by the firemen was the absence of water. Even the waterholes wore dry. At the Croydon-road an endeavour was made to intercept the fire by 600ft. of hose, and the manual from a spring, but as soon as the water was got the wind changed the direction of the fire, which was burning at a late hour last night. Bush-fires were raging also at Peakhurst and Oatley, an immense quantity of food for the fire being supplied by the dry timber.
