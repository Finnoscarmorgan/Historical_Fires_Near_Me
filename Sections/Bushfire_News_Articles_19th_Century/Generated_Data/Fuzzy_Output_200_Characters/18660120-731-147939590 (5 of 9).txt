 around them are illuminated by. au advancing line of fire extending for. miles ; leaving behind it thou sands of -blazing logs which light up the landscape so as to make it present the appearance of an immence city after nightfall. We are sorry to say most of these fires are the result of gross carelessness. We look upon the man who starts a bush fire as being equally criminal with the man who thrusts a firestick into the farmers haystack. The grass is the sole dependence of the grazier ; it is as valuable to him as the standing wheat crop is to the agriculturist. Moreover there is no saying where a bush-fire may stop. It may sweep over the country for scores of miles, and it changes its direction with the ever-varying changes iu the wind. Perhaps by great exertions a number of people may beat it out, but it usually bursts forth again two or three days afterwards to scatter fresh desolation around. Of course when the grass is dry as tinder, fires may be accidentally caused. The friction of dry branches agitated by the breeze, against one another, or tbe concentration of the sun's rays into a fo.cus through the bottom of a broken bottleâ€” causes like these have been known to produce bush-fires.
