although he has travelled a thresher for the last six years, this season's yield eclipses all previous seasons. Wheat has turned out, as far as he has yet gone, from 20 to 25, and in some instances, 30 bushels to the acre, and barley 25 to 40 bushels. Iguanas are uncommonly plentiful this year, and are departing from their old habits of living by indulging in some of the luxuries of civilisation ; Mr. John Fulham shot one the other day, containing inside of it a full- grown fowl and a hen's egg. The woolshed was burnt down at St. Jame's last week. How the fire originated is not known. There were also bush-fires raging in the vicinity of the Hill Plain, and near Mr. Tom's selection. I have not heard what damage was done, but I am informed that a considerable amount of fencing has been burnt. The good yield of this season will make the Murray Valley one of the most important farming districts in Victoria. The roads in all directions present quite a busy sight with the number of teams going to and from the railway station. At a future date I will give the relative re- turns of the different kinds of wheat, also what descriptions have been found to stand the rust best.
