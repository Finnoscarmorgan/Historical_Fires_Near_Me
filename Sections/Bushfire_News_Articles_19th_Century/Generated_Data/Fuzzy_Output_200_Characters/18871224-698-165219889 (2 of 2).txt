There has been no rain, except a light shower which ? fell this morning, but was not sufficient to lay the dust. The want of rain is again beginning to be felt rathe:.* severely, and bush fires are raging as badly as ever. Th' grasshoppers seem to have taken their departure, and it is to be hoped they will not return this summer. Harvesting* is nearly over .here— that is, as far as the hay is concerned , but the wheat is not yet all in. The river is about tho name as last week. Business generally iB improving, aid . things are likely to be pretty brisk until after Christmas. In the stock market fat stock are bringing very low prices, the chief sales being effected in store sheep. The followu1 k are the crossings for the week :— 313 bullocks on 9th De cember -from Boorooma station
