inson, and H. Bywater each lost a quan- tity of grass and fencing. It is estimated that about 100 people were assisting in ex- tinguishing the fire including Constables Dwyer and Jenkin, from Heathcote, and Con- stable Haydon, from Axedale. By evening the progress of the fire was stopped, though at times owing to the long grass and the strong wind, it was impossible to stand before it. Between 5 and 6 o'cock on Satur- day evening the wind veered round, and a strong south wind has been blowing since. The bright glare from the burning timber was seen by people here on Saturday night. AVOCA, MONDAY. The bush fire is still burning, but all danger to farmhouses is now averted. Messrs. H. Mills and J. Mills have suffered considerable loss of grass and fences since last report, but owing to the vigilance of the public the fire is now fairly well confined, and hopes are entertained that it will be got under in a few days. Mr. Archer, who was injured on Saturday night is progressing favouriably. OMEO, MONDAY. Delightfully cool weather is now being ex perienced here. Bush fires have done damage, however, to several farms, three stacks being burned.
