y willingly. By the committee put- ting off the regatta, great dissatisfaction has been caused amongst all aquatic mon, who condemn their deoision has been very frivol- ous. Bargcmeu, for instance, como to town, lay up their vessols on the slips to get them io firat-olass trim for a certain date, and that date is altered. I ask how can these men afford to lose their time, trouble and expense they are put to by the notion of the association. The Regatta Association ought to have learned a good lesson from their past experience in postponing regattas. Thank ino you for your valuable space. Yours.eto. I BUSHFIRE.
