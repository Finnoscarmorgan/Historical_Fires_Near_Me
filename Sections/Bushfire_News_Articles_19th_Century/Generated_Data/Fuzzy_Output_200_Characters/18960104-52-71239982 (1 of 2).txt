Through these columns we have so often impressed this fact upon farmers that most of them have now come to our way of thinking. Those who still cling to the idea of late sowing rarely harvest a good crop, even in what may be termed a good season. Farmers who have stacks of hay or corn would do a wist thing if they ploughed the land for some dis- tance round them, which will, in a measure, protect them against any probable bush'fires.
