RICHMOND. Mr C Iceley was rather startled whilst in Sydney on Tuesday, by a report which he received to the effect that his house and outbuildings on The Terrace had been destroyed by the bush-fires. He caught a train to Blacktown, drove from there to Richmond, and got home during the day, only to find—to his intense satisfaction—that the report was incorrect. The fires did a good deal of damage in the immediate vicinity. The stone-fruit trees on Mr C Iceley’s property on The Terrace look remarkably well, and with anything like good seasons should make excellent progress. Two or three seats in the Park are kicking about in all directions—similar to those in Windsor Park. They should be made fixtures, and be repaired. We have been shown the plans ot alteration and additions to Mr Vindiu
