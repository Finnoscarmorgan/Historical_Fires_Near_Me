kowners respecting feed for the winter appear to be exceedingly promising. As a consequence of the rain and the excellent headway made by the grass, store sheep are in great demand, and many saleB have been made of wethers for fattening purposes. The rain has also benefitted the farmers and caused several of them in the district to start the plough, the ground being in first-class order for that operation; and the ground is always benefited by being exposed to tbe sun's fertilising rays for some time before being sown. Owing to the green bottom now to be seen everywhere, all danger has disappeared of bushfireB for another year, and a pleasant feeling of security from that scourge is consequently adopted with gratitude. Our Literary and Debating Society had an unusually interesting meeting on Tuesday evening, when the subject for debate was "Free Trade versus Protection." There was also a good audience, including a fair proportion of ladies. The chair was occupied by Mr. Alex. BOBS, one of the vice-presidents, and the members present wereâ€”Rev. J. Walker, Rev. W. Scott Whittier, Messrs. Irwin Smith, E. Rowe, D. Byrne, P. Riches, J. Reid, J. Ross. J. Bruce, Jos. Lawson, J. H. Godfrey, D. Haynes, H. C
