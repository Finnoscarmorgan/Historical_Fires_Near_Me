BURNED TO DEATH. Maitland. November 22. At a fire which occurred yesterday at Kalka- bury, a young man, named William Murnane, aged 19, was burned to death. His body was found all charred. The deceased was suffering from heart disease, and was probably struck down and suffocated before he could get out of the way. By the same fire Mr. Murnane, sen., lost 15 acres of standing crop. LATER TELEGRAM. Mr. Henry Lamshed, J.P. held an inquest last night on the body of young Murnane, and a verdict was returned that the deceased's death was caused by a bush-fire, but there was no evidence as to the origin of his death. The funeral took place to-day, and Father Kennedy, of Kadina, officiated. There was a large attendance, the deceased being much respected.
