f to the sufferers. Tli? Government intends to grant loans to the burnt-out settlers at 3 per cent, and will not require the repayment of any portion of the capital until the lapse of five years. The losses of individual settlers are, with few exceptions, under £500, but hundreds are penniless and destitute. The Gippsland Municipal Association has called a meeting of all the Gippsland shires at the Melbourne Town Hall for next Tuesday, when the extent and measure of the losses will be ascertained, and steps taken to give effective help. Subscriptions to the fund for the relief of the sufferers by the bush fires now amount to £7,150.
