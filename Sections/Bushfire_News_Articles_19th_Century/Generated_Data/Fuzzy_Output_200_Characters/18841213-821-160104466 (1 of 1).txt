urhood of Stratbalbyn, and in the older-settled districts among the hills, would therefore be advisable. The climate and soil of these districts are suited to its cultivation. According to analysis made under the direction of the Victorian Wattle Board, the bark of A. decurrens yields from 29 to 34 per cent, of tannic acid. Upon the bark of a tree twelve years of age, grown near Mount Gambler, Mr. George Goyder's observations are as followsThickness of bark, 0 34 in.; per cent, of tannin, 27*5; and per cent, of extractive matter, 44*7. This species can be culti vated as readily as A. pycnantha. After bushfires run over any district composing its habitat, it springs np in abundance. The tree is somewhat branchy in its habit, and requires close planting in order to check this ana make it throw its woodmaking vitality into the stem. One pound of seed is said to contain as nany as 40,000 grains. These can be germinated with less hea1 and earlier than those of the broad-leaf species.' Acacia saligna, or tbe Western Australian Wattle.â€” This tree is now under experiment at tbe Wirrabara Forest Nursery, but nothing can yet be said as to its adaptability or otherwise to our conditions of soil and climate.
