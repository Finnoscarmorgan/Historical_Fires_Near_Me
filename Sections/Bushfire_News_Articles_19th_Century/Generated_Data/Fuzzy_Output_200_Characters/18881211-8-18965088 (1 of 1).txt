milar to that often heard passing between the line and earth wire plates of the Morse telegraph switch during thunderstorms, and not unlike that made by strik- ing an ordinary lucifer match. What is most curious about tho discharge is that there was not the slightest indication of a storm to be seen in any direction. The wind at the time, thirty-five minutes paBt ten a.m., was west by north and very light. The clouds were cirrus (mares' tales), moderately plentiful, and very high. The atmosphere was very hazy, like that generally seen in dry summer weather, and in all probability caused by smoke from bush-fires. The day was very hot, and there had not been much rain for some months. Circumstances seem to in- dicate that the discharge was a very strong one. The line wire referred to was the bottom one of six running on the same line of poles. The other wires were all in connection with Morse telegraph in- struments, and most of them were connected with an office within a distance of a quarter of a mile. I mention this fact because the top wires of a tele- graph line generally receive the greatest force of lightning discharges, they being the ones first struck ; and the fact of the office being so n
