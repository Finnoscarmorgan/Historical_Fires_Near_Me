nquiry, it is found that Mr Townsend' s duties do not include the com piling of the returns referred to. It is only due to that gentleman that this apparent neglect should be explained away, and the satisfaction of the Council expressed. It may further be men tioned that Mr Townsend does not possess the means of preparing returns of licenses, and that any information afforded by him on the matter was merely from courtesy only. Fire. — On Saturday evening a large fire was observable in a south-westerly direction from Castlemaine. We have not heard whether it was the destruction of premises or merely a bush-fire; but from its magnitude we fear that it will be found to be the former. Also, yes terday afternoon, a similar conflagration was observed at the back of Lady Gully, which proved to be a large bush fire. Sittings of Law Courts.— The next Cir cuit Court will be holden at Castlemaine, on Wednesday; 27th April. The General Sessions on 15th June. The County Court, April 1st. Court of Mines, April 1st.
