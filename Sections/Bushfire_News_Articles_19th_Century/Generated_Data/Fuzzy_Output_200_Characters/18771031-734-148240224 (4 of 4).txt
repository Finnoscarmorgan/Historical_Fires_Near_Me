what time it was when I left. When I got to Chimney Hut Gulley, Crouch and Byfield were there. If there had been any smoke about on my way down it would not have escaped my notice. They accused me of setting fire to the bush, and directed my atten- tion to smoke. Reached Juradine about dusk; found my stacks burnt down; they contained. from 26 to 30 tons of hay. Have bought hay at £5 per ton since the fire. Consider my garden worth £7 or £8, and some harness which was destroyed to be worth £4. Have lived about four years at Juradine. There was a very strong wind that day. I have had some experience at bush-fires. Cannot see that Lawnswood was in any danger. By the Defendant—You were at Lawnswood. when I came and left you there. I was mis- taken about the horse. Do not know why you made the fire. The original fire might have burnt my premises. Think it would. The Court was then adjourned until the fol- lowing morning.
