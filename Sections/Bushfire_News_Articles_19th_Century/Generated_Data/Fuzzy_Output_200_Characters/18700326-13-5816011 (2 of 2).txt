 the end of the week, holders of interests naturally began to be anxious as to the probable yield from the first crushing, and two or three gentlemen proceeded to the works to ascertain how things were going on. Arrived at the stamp- house, their astonishment may be moro easily imagined than described at finding that not a drop of quicksilver had been placed in the ripple-boxes. It is almost unnecessary to add that the further services (?) of those having control were at once dispensed with." It is related by the Gipps Land Mercury that some time ago, during the prevalence of the very hot weather and bushfires, a fire arose near Nambrok-house, the residence of Mr. W. E. King, which placed that valu- able property in extreme danger. Mr. King and the menservants were away on the run, but the maidservants, under the direction of Miss Butler, the governess, attacked the flames, and after great and prolonged labour they succeeded in getting them under. Nam- brok is insured in the office of the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company for a large amount, and on hearing of the narrow escape they had had of losing a large amount, the directors voted a sum of money to the extinguishers of the fire.
