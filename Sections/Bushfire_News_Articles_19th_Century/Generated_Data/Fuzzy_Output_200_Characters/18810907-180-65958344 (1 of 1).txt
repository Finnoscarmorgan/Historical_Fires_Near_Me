We think it would have been far better — and perhaps it is not too late even now to amend the bill this session — to pro vide that the occupiers of all land be compelled to plough on the inside of their boundary fence to the extent of a given number of feet, thereby obviating almost to a certainty the danger of a bush-fire. We have seen this followed in the other colonies wifch good results.
