COUNTRY NEWS. NORTHAM. (From a Correspondent). There ia nothing much to write about, beyond a slight allusion to that, which, is, at all times a stock topic for a few remarks, namely, the weather. It has been fright- fully not and relaxing for some days past, and a very extensive bush-fire has very con- siderably added to the tropical heat of the aun. On Tuesday there were very heavy, blacksand threatening clouds surcharged with thunder and electricity, and the peals of the former were, occasionally, exceedingly heavy and startling, while the flashes of the latter were, at times, extremely vivid. Some rain fell, but it was very partial,-scant in some places, and rather copious in others. On account of the excessive and long continued drought, water is, of course, becoming daily more scarce, and, matters, in this respect, present the most alarming and direful an- ticipations. "
