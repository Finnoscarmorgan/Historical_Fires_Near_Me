ach of promise case of Hales v. Fennell was again brought on, when the same damages were claimed. The case was heard by Mr. Scott, S.M., and a jury of four. The evidence on both sides was very conflicting and similar to that given at the last trial. The evidence was fairly summed up by the stipendiary magis trate, and the jury, after a retirement of half an hour, returned a verdict for the plaintiff for Â£75. Several cases of trespassing on travelling reserves were heard, and the de fendants were muleted in 2s. per head and costs. The weather throughout the day has been remarkably hot, and a number of bushfires have been noticed. Blackmore's Sheaoak Range Run with 15,000 sheep was submitted for sale by auction to-day. After a spirited competition, the offers not coming up to the reserve, the property was passed in at 13s. 6d. per head.
