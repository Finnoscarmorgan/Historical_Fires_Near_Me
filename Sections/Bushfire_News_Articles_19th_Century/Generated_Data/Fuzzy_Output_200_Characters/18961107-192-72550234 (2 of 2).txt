he oontinned dry weather (writes our Windsor cor respondent) is causing a large amount of anxiety among farmers. Everything bears unmistakable traces of the lack of moisture, b eed for etock is getting scarce on account of the dry time, and bush-fires are destroying a large amount of pasturage. Naw, as rain started to fall on the preceding Friday, and continued at intervals right through to Wednesday last, I fail to see that this state ment was any other than most misleading. Even before Friday's downpour, the crops looked well, and farmers did not particularly need rain, except tor grass. And as for bush fires raging, why there certainly has not been one in this locality this year. Exaggerated statements such as the above OHIV tend to create a false impression in the minds of people outside the district. Yours, &c; , BULLRJDGE FARMER
