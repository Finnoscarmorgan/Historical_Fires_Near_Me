ious damage has been done, except the loss of the feed. For many miles round this district it is quite destroyed, and but for the men at Gabberdine belonging to the road-party, Mr. Sinclair would have lost crops, buildings, and most likely a flock of sheep. The men worked well, and secured alL Mr. Wroth has two small farms near Newcastle, and it was mainly due to the assistance rendered by a few men of the depot, with others, that both crops and buildings were not destroyed. The men in both cases have been recommended, and doubtless the authorities will do something for them, as of all work, fighting bush-fires is the most unplea- sent. Northam has suffered, but to what extent I know not. Messrs. G. Monger and Whitfield have returned from the North-East, and report that they found plenty of water on the run discovered some months ago ; they have also brought in some specimens of rock-slate and flint, and from their report, this seems the most likely part of West Australia for gold ; and to this part of the country a party of practical men should be sent without delay. I regret to say that the Rev. Mr. Innes has been seriously- ill for nearly a fortnight, and still continues indisposed. Manna. Gum.
