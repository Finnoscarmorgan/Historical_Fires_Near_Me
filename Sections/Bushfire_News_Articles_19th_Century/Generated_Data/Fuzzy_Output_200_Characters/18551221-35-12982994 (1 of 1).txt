rms class A. Of these, when they arrive at maturity, scarcely any are sound at heart, and when sound the heart wood is of no value, from its extreme brittleness, Another serious defect arises from the gum resin of the tree extravasatiog in greater or less quantity among the woody tissue or suc- cessive layers of the Wood. Thra seriously injures the timber. Another characteristic of the hard woods is, that although the majority make ex- cellent fuel many of them are slow to kindle, and a few will scarcely burn at all. Class B. com- prehends the short stemmed trees of the arid stony tracts, where the " bush-fires" destroy them every four or five years, and arereproduced from the stem. The third class, C The tim- ber of this class is finer in the grain than class A., and is sound at heart; the heart wood may be used as in the case of the timber trees of Europe. Many of the trees in this class are very fine and beautiful in the grain ; one of the most beautiful is the " Cedrela Australis, used in joiners' and cabinet work ; but as the great majority have not been used m the colony, no correct idea of their value as timber can be formed. Many of the 'trees attain to gigantic proportions, such as the th
