On the following Sunday Mr. Moore; as he usually does on his visits here; conducted a religious service. Mr. Finlayson, of Strelley Farm, narrow- ly escaped being burnt out the other day through a bushfire.

Higgins, living up the Capel River, were sufferers to the extent of altoitt £100, through a bush fire, the other week f the principal property destroyed consisting of L'ay.arid other fodder, ete., and some outbuildings'.
