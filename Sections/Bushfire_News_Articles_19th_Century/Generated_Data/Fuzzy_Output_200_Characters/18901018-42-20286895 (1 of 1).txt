The School of Arts is a new addition to the buildings of Killarney. The hills shown in the background are in New South Wales. Christ Church is a building eleven years old.

The church stands on about two acres of land, and the house on the left of the sketch is the parsonage. The next sketch shows the bush-fire method of clearing scrub and timber. The meadow shown in the foreground is on the bank of Farm Creek, which is a tributary of the Condamine. In the foreground is seen a vineyard belonging to the Killarney Inn. The remaining illustration shows the local butcher taking his customers' supplies up the Barrier Range over tracks which most people would regard as impassable.
