ill avail them selves of these, as the bowling of Willey and his companions will require their greatest skill and patience to play it effec tually. On Saturday afternoon there were various evidences of a change in the weather. The tides were about six inches lower than usual, aud in consequence some of the works on the beach, which had to be suspended for a considerable time past, were able to be resumed. Shortly after mid-day the indications of an impending storm became plainly discernible. The mercury in the barometer fell several degrees, and a thick haze, so dense that many persons ascribed it to bush-fires, ascended from every point of the horizon. During the afternoon the wind blew in gusts, but the temperature was oppressive. Towards evening it calmed down, and appeared more settled. Yesterday morn ing the sun shone out, and the forenoon was close and warm. As the afternoon advanced, however, the sky became omin ously overcast, and by and bye a steady downpour of rain ensued. Showers fell at frequent intervals during the rest of the evening, and the change has been welcomed by everyone, particularly as the want of water was fa?t becoming a subject of general complaint in town and country.
