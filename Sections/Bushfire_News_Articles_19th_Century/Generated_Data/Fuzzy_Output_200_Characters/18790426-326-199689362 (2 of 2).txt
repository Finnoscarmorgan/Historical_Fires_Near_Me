On one side the foliage is dense, although dwarfed, throwing out branches near the ground in a parallel direction, and immense boulders con fronting us everywhere, so that it was sometime before we got to the top. We, however, were amply repaid for our toil, by the splendid view we had of the sur rounding country. In the distance, we could plainly see Wangaratta, Lake win ton, jroLupuiiKan, nuciaanu, ivan- diligong, Ovens River, and (but for flic bush-fires) Beechworth.

We also visited tlie " Cathedrals," an immense mass broken up into slabs of great height, and so disposed as to give at a distance some resnnblanco to a cathedral. Tlie largest detached rock is called ££ The Leviathan," and well it deserves its name. I did not measure it ; but our guide in formed us that it was 1G0 feot long, SO feet broad, and 60 feet high. What is most singular, is that it stands on one small central point of 12 feet square, from which it slopes upward and outward, and neitlier balanced nor upheld in any other way.
