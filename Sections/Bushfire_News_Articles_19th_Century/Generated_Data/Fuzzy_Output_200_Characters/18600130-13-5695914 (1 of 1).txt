. ». Saturday, Jnnuaiy 28. At thojPohce Ofiice yesterday Mr. Denton, of the late firm of Sanders' and Denton, brewer.-, was committed to tako his trial on a charge ot' stealing a 4-lb. tin of coffee, the property of his late partner ; the prosecutor being'Mr. Sanders himself. There is sorno talk of bringing Mr. QuaHor nir-.n, or Dr. Greeves. forward to fill the vacancy caubäd by Mr. Cowie s resignation of his seat for East Geolong. I do not" think >Dr. 1 Grooves would havo any chance here, however. ' Accounts _ continue to come in from vario as inland districts, of the great amount of darnaTe done by bush-fires during the late hot weather, many stations being said to.be quite burnt'out. Fortunately no lives aro reported to havo boen lost, and not many hui.ldings. Mr. Pettavel, tho vinegrower, estimates his loss by the hut hot Saturday and Sunday at not less than £5,000. Other vignerons aro' great sufferers also.
