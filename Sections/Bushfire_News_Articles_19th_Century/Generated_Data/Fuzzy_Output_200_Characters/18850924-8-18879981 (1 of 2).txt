 of Sept 14. The present severe drought serves to remind me me of a paper which I read 5th January 1864, before the Queensland Philosophical Society on on " Meterorology" and which led to the establishment in this colony of observing stations, till then unknown here, and as this paper, amongst other matter, contained a list of droughts and floods in south-east Australia since the year 1782, it may be of some interest to repeat that part of it now. From 1782 to 1792, Captain Flinders landed at intervals in various places on the south and east coasts of our continent, and he found traces of drought and bush fires invariably. The year 1788, when New South Wales was first settled, was a year of drought in Sydney; in 1797 a severe drought was observable at Western Port, in Bass Strait near where Melbourne was destined, forty years later, to be founded Then came a wet period, and in nearly every year from 1799 to 1800 there were high floods in New South Wales The Hawksbury River it is stated, rose 101 feet at the town of Windsor,crops were destroyed, wheat cost 80s a bushel and there was almost a famine as may well be imagined. Excessive rain ruled till 1810, when it stopped, and in 1811 water was sold
