BUSHFIRES AT LINTON. Bushfires have been raging around Linton lately, but beyond a little fencing in some places, nothing but scrub has been burnt. A strong wind on Thursday afternoon was driving tl>e fire towards tho .Clinton township, and the firemen were called one in conse quence. On Sunday afternoon an old China man was burning some rubbish near the Linton Cemetery, and the fire getting the better of him, burnt Â« good deal of the fence and spread over about an acre of the ceme tery.
