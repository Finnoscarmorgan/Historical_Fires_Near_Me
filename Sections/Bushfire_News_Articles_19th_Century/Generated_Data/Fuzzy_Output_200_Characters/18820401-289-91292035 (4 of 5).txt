Dropping lucifei-3 ? lighted or unlightcd, the carelessness of j smokers, the neglect of campers-out to ex- , languish their fires or prevent them fro:u igniting the grass, are all in tarn blamed, an I doubtless there is not one of these causes to which bush, fires may not justly be attri buted. There is occasionally also the work of the incendiary, and now and then stubHe-burning results- in the destruction of something, more valuable than- stubble. While, however, most bushfires are caused by the most shameful carelessness, it is extra ordinary how little pains some people take to guard their property. Any farmer could protect his holding by ploughing of burning round it^ whichever might be most convenient1 j and where fires travel great distances in farming country it is owing to this precaution not having been taken. With avery strong wind burning grass and piecas or burning bark or wood are blown across road; and ploughed or burnt spaces, but still thcs 3 breaks in the herbage lessen the danger very greatly, and in the majority of case3 stop the spread of a fife.
