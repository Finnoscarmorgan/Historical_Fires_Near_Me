It grows with wonderfull facility from seed, and pollard-trees shoot up with a marvellous rapidity. Its stringy bark is in our opinion its best protection against the fearfully devastating effects of bush-fires, although no doubt the young saplings would suffer and perhaps be killed by such a visitation.
