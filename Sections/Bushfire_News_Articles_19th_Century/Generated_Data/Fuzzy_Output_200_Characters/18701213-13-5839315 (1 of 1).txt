treams and springs. Countries which lind large surface deposits of vegetable earth, and forests consisting of pines and de- ciduous trees, were traversed by extensivo and never-failing rivers, aud provided with constant springs and lakes ; the climate was less variable than that of Australia, droughts less frequent, and floods not so sover ; in fact, the eli mato was moderated and ameliorated. Gum-trees shed their leaves principally during summer, and they did not then decay readily, being of a dry harsh nature, and chttTged with resinous matter ; but deciduous trees shed their leaves in autumn, when bush-fires were not pre- valent, during the rainy season, and, there- fore the leaves readily decayed, and produced vegetable soil. The vegetable soil on the ranges here was chiefly produced by the decay of tree ferns. It was questionable whether gum treo leaves respired moisture to the same extent as deciduous trcos. In the conversation which followed, it was remarked by the president that in nearly every case tho cracking of colonial timber . arose from fungus growth, which colonial timber seemed particularly subject to. One valuable tree Mr. Christy had failed to men- tion was the beech, which thro
