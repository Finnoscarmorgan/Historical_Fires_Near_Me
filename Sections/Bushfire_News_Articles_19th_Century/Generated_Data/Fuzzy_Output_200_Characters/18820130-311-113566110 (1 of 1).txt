His house was saved by the debris within a circuit of 30 yards being raked clear, and in this operation he was materially assisted by neighbors. Up till a late hour last night the fire ivas still raging, and, driven by a northerly breeze, was progressing in the direction of Tongala. The Rev. J. C. Johnstone, M. A. was to have preached at the Kanyapelia Sunday School yesterday afternoon, but when he got there at three o'clock, he found bush-fires raging all round the district. All tho adults were away saving the property,of their neighbors, or looking after their own homesteads. Messrs. Laurence and Goodchild and Mrs. Stewart represented the congregation. The scholars were, therefore, dismissed, and Mr. Johnstone and Mr. R. P. Scott, after ren dering all the assistanco in their power, started back to apprise Mi-. M'Bride of the danger to his paddock.
