ICHMOND, (from the Richmond Uiver Express, Sept. 9.) An inquest was held on Thursday last, by the Coroner (James Stocks, Esq., J.P.) and a jury of ten, to enquire into the circumstances attending the burning of a dwelling house with contents, and a barn used as a store and cart-house which stood near the residence, at Deep Creek. The property is owned by Mr. Zuill, of the Clarence, and was occupied by Mr. J. F. Anderson, who, however, waa in Grafton when the fire occurred, and no person was left on the premises. The place was burnt on the night of the 19th AugUBt, and from the fact that there were no bush fires in the vicinity on that date, and from other circumstances, it is evident that the place was maliciously set fire to. After a quantity of evidence had been taken, the jury brought in a verdict that the place had been wilfully set fire to by some person or persons unknown. The buildings belonged to Mr. Zuill, and the furniture to Mr. Anderson. The loss is eatimated at Â£150.
