Heat as a Motive Power. SOME gentleman has lately met with considerable opposition in advocating the use of " heat as a motive power," to the efficacy of which we can certify from experience, having frequently, on a hot-wind day, with clouds of dust and smoke blowing down from the bush-fires in the background, and the thermometer at 110Â° in the shade, been absolutely forced by the heat to seek the coolest quarters procurable (a cellar preferred, well stocked with cool drinks). We have also noticed the application of this force when the clown in the pantomime, by the employment of a red-hot poker, removes all his opponents most expeditiously. As these facts are incontrovertible, it seems absurd for sceptics to doubt the power of this force, which may yet achieve greater results even than those recorded.
