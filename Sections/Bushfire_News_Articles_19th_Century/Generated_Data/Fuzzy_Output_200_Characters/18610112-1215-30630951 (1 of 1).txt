I hope he may get ample employment for it. He deserves encouragement for the spirited man- ner in which he thus supplies the district with what was greatly wanted. The weather is all that could be desired very hot; but we must expect to get hot weather at this time of the year. The roads are hard and the creeks are all dried up, con- sequently, the grass will soon dry and we may expect to hear of fresh and disastrous bush- fires. Gundaroo, 9th January, 1861.
