A spark from the fire must lave blown across the river, as the grass on the opposite Bide took fire, carrying all before it. It burned all Mr.Kapeney's wheat, which, had just been reaped, about 10 acres, besides his fencing. It then spread to Mr. S. Ryrie'e wheat paddock, which had also been reaped, and destroyed about 35 acres, besides burning his house and also the fencing. Great sympathy is felt for the sufferers. COWRA, Monday.
