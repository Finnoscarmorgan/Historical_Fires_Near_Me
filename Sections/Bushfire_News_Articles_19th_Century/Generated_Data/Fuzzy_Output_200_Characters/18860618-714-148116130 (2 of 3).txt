| case may have thrown suspicion on Korber, but there was ne definite evidence that ho lighted the fire. The younger Wilstead said there was a I connection bet ween the fire in Korber's paddock | and that which passed over Wilstead's, but if | this had been tlio case, there would have been independent, testimony on the point. The evi I deuce for the defence would show that Korber burnt rubbish on March 18th, but that the fires were extinguished the same night. It will also be proved that someone was shooting among the ' dry undergrowth near Wilstead's an the morning of the 19th. It was natural when a bushfire damaged property for the owner to look about for some one to blame. He was confident, how ever, that in the present case the jury would be unable to trace the origin of the fire to liis client. John Korber, son of defendant, deposedâ€”On March 18th assisted my father in burning rubbish. My brother Charles was there too. Wc cut bushes from the dead stumps in one patch and burnt them. Left the fire at 8.30 p.m. and went to tea. There was one stump smouldering then. We threw dirt over it before going to tea. Went back after tea but saw no fire or smoke. Threw more earth on the stump to make sure.
