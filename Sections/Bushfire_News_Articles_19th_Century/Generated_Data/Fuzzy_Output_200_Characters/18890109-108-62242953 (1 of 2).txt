DARGO. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT). Monday. Dargo is beginning to put on its coat of green again, for we are having splendid showers of rain, and they are such nice gentle showers that it is barely possible to coceive the difference in the appearance of the country in so short a space of time. Four weekes ago we were surrounded with bushfires in every direction, almost like the account one reads of the last days of Pompii, and had it not been for the almost super- human exertions put forth by the energetic young men of this district in the way of fighting and keeping back the fires, I feel certain that there would have been great losses. Now the country looks more like flood than fires, but such is Australia, bush fires one month, and floods the next. Still the change from fire to water is a pleasant one and it is to be hoped that these splendid showers are visiting all parts of the country. The hop crops on Dargo look very well,
