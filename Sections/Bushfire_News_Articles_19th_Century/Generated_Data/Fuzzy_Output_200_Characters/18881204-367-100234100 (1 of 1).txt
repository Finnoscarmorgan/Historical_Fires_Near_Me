hey are causes of subsequent rain; and the more intense the heat, the greater likelihood of rain' soon following. Another point noticed by several obser vant'settlers is that a few days before the late rain, springs which had apparently dried up began to run. We do not know what the connection may be, probably some subtle atmospheric change, but the fact is regarded by old residents as distinctly pointing to an approaching fall of rain. The present instance appears to confirm the opinion. Yet another phenomenon is worthy of note. For a fortnight or more the atmo sphere had been obscured by smoke from bush-fires; but a few days previous to the rain, the smoke suddenly cleared away, without any apparent reason. We conceive this was in some way connected with a change in the condition of the atmosphere, and that such change betokened rain. The study of weather signs is most im portant to every one whose occupatiouns or interests are concerned in the yield of crops, the growth of grass, or the state of the markets; and every indication which may help to form a trustworthy opinion should be duly noted. The instances above given will therefore not be deemed trifling.
