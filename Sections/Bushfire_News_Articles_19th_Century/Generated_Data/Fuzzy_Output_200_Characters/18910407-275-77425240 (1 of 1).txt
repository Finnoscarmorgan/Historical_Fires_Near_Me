On Wednesday night says the Albany Advertiser a man named Walter Scott was brought down to Albany from .Round Swamp suffering from severe burns received on Monday night at the latter plac-?. It seems that Scott, who is a kangaroo hunter, had spent Easter Monday at the Raund Swamp Races and in the evening being somewhat intoxicated he laid himself down by a bushfire to sleep. By some means or other the unfortunate man's clothes became ignited and soon began to scorch his flesh.
