ad being duly deposited with the Vic torian Customs, the trip up the river began. The track on the Victorian side is through well watered, hilly country. The feed on the roads had been greatly cut up with 'travelling cattle ; but still the sheep could fill their bellies better than had been their lot for months, and they began to improve. I heard fair accounts, of them for some time until their destination was reached, when I received the following note from Smith : — ' Dear Sir, — I am sorry to inform you that we have met with great disaster here ; we had just reached the land you had hired when the bush fire which has been raging this five days among the hills along the Upper Murray swept down upon us ; the heat had been intense for some days and the wind like the breath of a furnace. We had not been able to see the hills for a week, everything being obscured in thick smoke ; the loud crackling of the fire as it devoured the green leaves or the thick growth of saplings was the first intimation we had that it was near us. We tried all we could to save the sheep, but the ground was so difficult to drive them over, and the wind was so strong, that half of them were burnt or scattered by the lire. T
