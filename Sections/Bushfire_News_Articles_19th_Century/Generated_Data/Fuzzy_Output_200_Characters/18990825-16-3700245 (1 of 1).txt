reservoir ; many of the upper arms are already choked with them. They seem to be able gradually to adapt themselves to any depth of water. The writer has pulled them up with stalks over 12ft long and then probably several feet remained attached to the root. It has been proposed by the waterworks authorities to fence in the catchment area of the reser- voir to prevent stock trespassing therein.
