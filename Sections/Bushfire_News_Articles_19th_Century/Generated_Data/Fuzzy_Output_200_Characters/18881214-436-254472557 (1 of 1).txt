C0RRY0NG. (FBOM OUB OWN COBBESPONDENT.) MONDAY, December 10. Bush-fires are again raging in the hills around Cudgewa and Nariel Some of the selectors have lost all their grass, which means money just now ; others have had a quantity of fencing destroyed, and nearly all have lost considerable time by having to watch the fire day and night to prevent it stealing in on their holdings. Any persons owning dogs which they value would do well to keep them on the chain just now. During the past week some ill-disposed person or persons, for reasons not known, have been laying poisoned baits in the vicinity of the towc, one or two harmless canines having received a dose.
