Barmedman. Mauch 5. The survey of the selections having been completed, this place should'become somewhat livelier, for there is a flour mill within 23 miles, and the samples of wheat, especially those of Mr. Clements, of Hose Vale, are remarkably good. The grass continues green, for we have been favoured with nice rain, which prevents bush-fires. The farmers are en deavouring to procure sheep, for* in some cases there is abundance of grass; and no stock to eat. it. Cattle and sheep are fat as whales, and the grass would be extremely dan gerous were it not for the green shoots. The jockey club are more energetic than usual, and appear, by enormous placards and lengthy advertisements, deter mined to make the ensuing race meeting a success. The tickets for the race ball are in much demand. It is ex pected that the meeting will be largely attended.
