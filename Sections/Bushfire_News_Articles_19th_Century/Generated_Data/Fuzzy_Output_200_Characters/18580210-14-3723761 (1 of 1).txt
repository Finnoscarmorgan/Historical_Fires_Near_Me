DRAYTON. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Drayton, Feb. 5, 1858. SINCE my last communication there has nothing very particular transpired. A true and correct account has arrived here that the unfortnnate Dr. Lipperman's re- mains are found. The circumstances of iiis-aeainr~ând how lils body was found correspond with my first report to you, namely-died from hunger and exhaus- tion. His body has been found at the foot of a tree, where it appeared he lay down and died. Yesterday and last night we all thought our little township would be burned down, ia consequence of the rapid bush-fire that surrounded us. For- tunately the day and night was calm, otherwise there might have been serious damage done. In our Police Court yesterday, the following cases came on for hearing, viz., H. B. fitz, Esq., appeared against a man named Freestone, who was apprehended on warrant, on account of his non-attend- ance on summons for a breach of the Cattle Stealing Act, viz., having in his possession a mare of plaintiff's, which he acknowledged to have worked, but that the beast was lent to him by a man named William Á. Reynolds. As this was proven to be the case the man was liber- ated. Feb. 6
