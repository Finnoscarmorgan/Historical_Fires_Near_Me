ation of cleared scrub and bush, then the law ought to take"" the matter out of their hands and enact, that no man shall be allowed to have any brush or scrub within some feet of his fences, or wooden buildings, on pain of punishment. This might be fairly made a subject of legislation in the new Parliament, where probably, there will be matters quite as fiery to debate, without half the usefulness. We are happy in thinking, that the late fires have done little damage, besides such as verifies fully the truth of our remarks above. This good will probably result from so early a burning. When the future bush-fiies of January and February come, they will find part of their work done, and themselves warded off by their predecessor. In general, a bush-fire is a water-maker ; in the last instance, the wind was so strong as to blow the water so made away from the land ; hence we have not had the usual rain-and ex- cellent rain it is from its carbonaceous distillation -after a bush-fire. We trust, if needed, it will yet come.
