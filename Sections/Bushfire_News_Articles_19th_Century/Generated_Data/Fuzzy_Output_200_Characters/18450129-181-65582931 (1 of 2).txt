It is, however, to be borne in mind, that I shall in this letter compare the value of sand with tbe good soils during the summer season only, as during the winter on both descriptions or soil the vegetation is surprising ; but the better the land, of course the more profuse the growth of plants. But during the summer, the long and dry summer, it is an indisputable fact that the heavier the land, the sooner and easier it becomes parched and burnt up by the sun. The native or bush fires are also an annual destructive power to all the heavy lands, except perhaps some of those which may be fenced in, and so secured.
