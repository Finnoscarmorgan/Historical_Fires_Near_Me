 suddenly in the Hospital yesterday afternoon. Deceased was jammed between the buffers of two engines about a month ago on the turn-table at the Western station. He was admitted to the Hospital, and in course of time discharged. A day or two ago, however, he was re-admitted, suf fering from an abscess, through the bursting of which he died, as above stated. Under ordinary circumstanccs an inquest would have been held, but Dr Holthouse's services as coroner having been dispensed with, no enquiry took place, and Dr Owen yeatetday gave a certificate of death without performing a post-mortem examination.
