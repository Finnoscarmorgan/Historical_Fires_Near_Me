The Goree men now start for home, and in passing the Yarrabee woolshed are informed that the fire broke out in another direction and was coming straight on for the homestead. 'Bout ship' is the word, and on getting to the fire we soon burned a trail to the main road, and beat out and stopped the fire from, reaching the homestead. Here again I must remark that the Yarrabee men 'were disgracefully equipped, and quite useless with the ' pocket- handkerchief ' beaters they used. The Tubbo and Kerarbury runs also had their turn with bush fires, and in fact the whole country around Narrandera was ablaze about the same time. Hundreds of thousands of acres of grass were destroyed on the last-named stations alone, and some hundred miles of fencing burned to the ground. And I fear very much that many head of stock will be missing when muster takes place. It is now most probable that stock must be shifted for want of grass. All the fires about here are now extinguished, and may they keep so, I beg and pray.
