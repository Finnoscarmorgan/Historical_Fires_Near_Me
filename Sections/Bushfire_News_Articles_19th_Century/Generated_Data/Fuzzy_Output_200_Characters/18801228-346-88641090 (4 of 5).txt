fire was burning, a number of the residents left for the purpose of lending any assistance that might be required, but fortunately their services were not needed, as the fire was by this time extinguished. As far as I could hear about 1,200 acres of grass, and several miles of fencing were destroyed, however, as well as a small quantity of ripe grain which joined the grass paddocks. Happily the weather is very much cooler to-day (Monday), and there is every chance of the annual sports being a success. The crops are turning out fairly, the grain being of excellent quality. We learn from exchanges that bushfires have broken out during the past few days in various parts of the country. The Stawell correspon- dent of the Argus writes that a bush fire broke out in Wallalloo, between Carr's Plains and Glenorchy, on Thursday. The country was in a blaze for miles, and some hundreds of acres of crops were in danger. The farmers were en- gaged all Thursday night beating out the fire, but were only partially successful. Fortunately the wind changed, and blew the flames back on the burnt ground, so that they were eventually enabled to extinguish the fire.
