rings them home. We went away to Portland and stopped three weeks, and while we were away my father came home, but the cat would not come in. She would only stand out side and look in. He never saw any more of her while we were away, but when we came home she re turned too, and came inside and seemed very pleased to see us. Then she went away, and a couple of mornings afterwards we saw her outside with three kittens. They were very wild and we could not catch them. A Terrible Fire.— By Harold Marris, Christmas Hill, aged ten years one month.—One of the hottest days in last summer there was a terrible bush-fire which burnt a lot of fencing. One farmer had all his milking sheds, barns, pigsties, orhards, grass and miles of fencing destroyed. His house was only saved by some men who threw wet bags over it. The fire was caused by a man who was burning off, and did not watch it carefully. Some of the men fainted because the heat of the day and fire was so great.
