 I have been informed that a settler, who resides a few miles from hero, has in his employ a boy, eleven or twelve years old, that smokes a quarter of a pound of tobacco a week. The little fellow must get his weekly allowance if it can at all be got. It is nothing unusual in these days to see boys smoking, but tho boy in question surpasses all of his age in this direction that I havo heard of. There) is .a notion prevalent amo jig, boys, that they are not manly if they don't sm6ke,'but is it auy wonder, though boys do smoke, when those who should know better, sets the example? Most of the destructive bushfires that occur from timo to time in this district, as well as in many other places, originate by careless smokers. ..September 3, 1868.
