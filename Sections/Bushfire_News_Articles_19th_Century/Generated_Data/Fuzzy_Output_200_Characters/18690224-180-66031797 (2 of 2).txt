andsome from (he Government. Mr. George Monger returned from an exploring trip to the north east of lork on Friday last, having been about five weeks away. He represents the coun Clarkson's station, as being on the whole anything but promising ; in some places the feed was plentiful, but water out of the question ; in others this essen tial was pretty abundant, but the country in which it was to be fonnd was totally bare of grass. No natives were seen during the journey, but tracks and other indications gave evident signs of their recent presence in the neigbburhood of the route pursued by the party; bush-fires were raging on every side, and the whole country through which they journeyed was on their return, either bunt nn or burning. A dog which accompanied the party was poisoned by eating a pigeon; and Mr. W. Whit field was so ill after eating one of the same birds that for some days little hopes of his reovery were entertained, but fortunately he got through the sickness, and is now quite convalescent. I will en deavour next week to forward you, if procurable, a copy of Mr. Monger's journal. 23rd Feb, 1869.
