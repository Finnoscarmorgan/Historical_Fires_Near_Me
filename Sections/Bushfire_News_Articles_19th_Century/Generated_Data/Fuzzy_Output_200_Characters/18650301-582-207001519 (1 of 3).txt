The bushtires which raged during the day not far from Melbourne probably contributed to the overpower- ing" heat. Early in the evening the reflection of a great conflagration was observed iu the direction of Geelorig ; and accounts received in the course of the day show that there was quite a line of bush-fires be tween that town and Ballaarat. Our telegrams state that the .weather in the interior was far more severe than in Melbourne ; that bush-fires were in mnple'asant proximity to Ballaarat, Sandhurst, Daylesford, aud other towns ; that forests were a' blaze, and that homesteads had been destroyed.
