nd willing assistance rendered by all the settlers that could be gathered together, many of whom had been hard at similar work for previous nights. On last Saturday night Mr. Pumphries, who lives down the river, had ia hay stack, wheat stack, oat stack and^ailey stack together with stable, and pigsty destroyed and a calf burnt to death in its pen. It was 10 o'clock at night when be noticed the two stacks alight and no sign of a bush fire near. Up to the present the cause of the fire has not been ascertained. He estimates his loss at between £200 and £300, his house being all that was saved. Races and bush fires are the topics of the day. A cool change appears to have set in, which, it is hoped, will at least check the fires for a time.
