s one of the most respectable, strightforward, honest, and up right men in the neighbourhood — a man whom no one would refuse to trust with anything. The charge is preferred on the evidence of a man, a shepherd, named Netherly. The trial resulted in Mr. Cole's being committed for trial at the Supreme Court. On the game day, by the informa tion of the Ranger, Messrs. Riggs and Stephens were fined £5 each for illegally depasturing sheep, and Mr. Broad was fined £10 for a similar offence. I have been informed by a gentleman who came down from Mount Remarkable on Tuesday that there was a most destructive bushfire raging furiously near the Mount, which he considers was quite twelve miles wide, and was, he said, running at a furious rate, so that a terrible result may be antici pated. Last week an inquest was held at Mount Bryan on a fire which took place there a few days previous, and consumed 25 miles of grass. No clue could be found as to the origin of the fire, but the Jury, which consisted of 14, were unanimously ia of the opinion that it arose from carelessness, and. returned a verdict to that effect.
