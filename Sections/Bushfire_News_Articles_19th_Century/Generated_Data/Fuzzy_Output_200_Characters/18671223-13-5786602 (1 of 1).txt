Notice of appeal was given. Ebenezer M'Welter was fined £30 as owner of diseased sheep which had been allowed to stray on the Killmorey Run ; £5 for not having them branded, and £20 foirdriving them on a public road without the permission of the scab inspector. John Polemson was fined £39 as owner of an unregistered flock of diseased sheep, num- bering 390. The West Bourke Guardian states "that an alarming bushfire occurred on Thursday last, near Bacchus Marsh. A foolish or malicious fellow, who had been engaged fencing the racecourse, made a fire to char the posts, al- though the hot north wind was blowing furiously. The adjoining grass took fire, and the flames went off in a southerly direction at almost race-horse speed, doing a vast amount of damage in its destructive course. The grass belonging to Messrs. Simmons, Keefe, Clark, and Hines, was completely de- stroyed. The latter person was particularly unfortunate, having lost, in addition to 300 acres of grass, all his wheat and much other property.
