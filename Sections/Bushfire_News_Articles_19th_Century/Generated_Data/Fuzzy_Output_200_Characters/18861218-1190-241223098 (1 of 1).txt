Turner, a very industrious and painstaking young Victorian artist, is being exhibited in the Art Gallery of Mr Stevens, at 21 Elizabeth Street. It is a companion to a picture which the same artist exhibited some few months ago, entitled "Fighting for Home." which was presented by a Melbourne gentleman to the Melbourne Club. The present production is called "Saved," and graphically presents the scene in and from the clearing around the slab huts of the selectors when the fight with the bush- fire is over. The picture is a fine piece of work, and will no doubt find many admirers, not only among those already familiar with Mr. Turner's work, but among a larger circle. Mrs T. P. Hills announces her intention of giving original and Shakespearean recitals at the Freemason's Hall on Boxing Night. The recital will be under the patronage of Sir Wm. and Lady Clarke. The City Organist will perform the follow- ing selections on the grand organ this evening at 8 o'clock : â€” 1, Overture, "The Poet and the Peasant," Suppe ; 2. Andante, "The Lost Chord," Sullivan ; 3, Opera Selection, " Norma," Be
