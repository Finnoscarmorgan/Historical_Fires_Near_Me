Of armed hedge plants suited for fences and capable of resist ng allordinary stock, or indeed any stock except wild cattle-against which any fence, live or dead, is equal ly useless--there are several, nor are there many soils on which one or other of these would not grow. There is the African Boxthorne, the Osage Orange, the armed Acacia, the commonil gorze or furze several of the Rosace-e and others, some of them able to hold their own on poor soils and nearly all growing freely on soils which are even moderately fertile, and all cap able of resisting bush fires better than dry fences ofjarrah or white gum. Of course even live fences are not to be had without expense. In the case of some the young plants have *to be raised in prepared ground either from seed or cuttings, while even such as can be raised from cuttings in natural soil on which the fence is to stand have still to be planted, an operation requiring the digging of a trench and half filling it with the decayed leaf mould at hand,so as to give the plant astart. But the fence, once planted and grown remains, impervious to all ordinary assailants, and requires no further attention than an a
