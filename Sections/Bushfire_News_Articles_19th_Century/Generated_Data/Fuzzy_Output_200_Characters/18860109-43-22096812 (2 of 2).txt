ily re- sponded to; but it requires a more com- prehensive movement to afford relief to others almost equally as deserving. Public meetings could be convened to be held at Cobden and Camperdown, and some organised system established whereby funds could be obtained for the relief of the whole of the sufferers. It must be remembered that the majority of those who have been burnt out, lost their all on Tues- day, and relief to be effective must be prompt. The movement once started would rapidly spread, and we have no doubt those in other places who have read the account of the damage oc- casioned by the bush-fires will respond to a public appeal. We would again urge that immediate steps be taken to raise a fund for the relief of those who have, at one blow, been deprived of the savings of years. â–
