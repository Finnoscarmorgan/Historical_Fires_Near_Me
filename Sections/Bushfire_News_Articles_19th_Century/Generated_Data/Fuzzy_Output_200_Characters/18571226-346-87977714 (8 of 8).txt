s time many places were in danger, and Mr. Whitworth, my informant, was compelled to return, so fierce were the flames. BUSH FIRES AT BALLARAT.—The Ballaarat Times gives the following account of Wednesday's heat, as experienced in that district :—The wind was from the north nearly all day; occasional gusts from the south and south-west occurring at intervals to tantalise the panting and oppressed wayfarer with the hope of a change—a hope that was no sooner raised than it was disappointed. In the course of the day columns of smoke were seen to arise from the woods surrounding the town, in- dicatory of bush fires, and those, we have been informed, were fierce and numerous. The Bunin- yong forest was on fire during the greater part of the day, and from the foot of Mount Warrenheip a smoke was seen to ascend which betokened a fire of great extent and fierceness. From the Bullarook Forest, and from the woods beyond Creswick, the same indications of fire proceeded, and we ex- pect to hear from those quarters of extensive conflagrations. At Portuguese Gully the ground vegetation was on fire, and at the Springs, we regret to say, a large breadth of standing crop was destroyed, as well as some farm houses.
