TREES PERISHING.â€”The Hamilton Spectator (Western District) some time ago mentioned a singular mortality among the gum-trees on a tract of country twenty miles long and including every variety of soil. It has by some been supposed that bush-fires have had something to do in producing such results. About eighteen months ago we noticed the curious fact, that millions of forest trees in different parts of the colony were perishing, and we endeavoured to show that grubs and caterpillars were the agents at work. Since we first noticed the decay we have more fully studied the subject, and the general result we have arrived at is, that the agents of destruction are the larvae of insects. The ova are deposited in the bark of living and apparently healthy trees; as soon as the grubs are hatched they bore into the bark and cut passages along
