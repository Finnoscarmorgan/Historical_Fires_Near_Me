ings, by means of which it could be irrigated without any difficulty. The soil is a grey loam with clay subsoil, and is splendidly adapted for fruit-growing, a fact proved by the large size and excellent quality of the fruit produced. A proof of the fertility of the soil is given in a small crop of oats which was sown between the rows of fruit trees and wvhich was recently cut for ensilage, some of the stems reaching the re- markable height of 9ft. On the same land 18 tons of potatoes to the acre have been obtained. Of the nine acres at present com- prising the orchard — 3 acres were destroyed by the bush fires at the be- ginning of the year—8 acres are de- voted to apples, the remainder being chiefly peaches, and there are also a few pears, pluns, etc. The orchard was first planted 14 years ago but, like all orchardists who have to gain their knowledge by experience, Mr. Crisp made mistakes in planting vari- eties unsuited to the climate, the con- sequence being that a considerable number of his first planted fruit- trees had to be either uprooted or re-grafted. Almost the whole of the orchard is in full bearing, and the average yield is about 40 tons of fruit, most of which is disposed of in the
