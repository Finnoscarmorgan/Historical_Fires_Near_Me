Ode Bauple correspondent writes under date 17th November We' have been having very sultry, hot weather for the last two or three weeks, and the clouds- of dust are something terrible. The crushing at the sugar mill is drawing to a close tor tne season, and they will probably be closing dpwh some time next week. Be railway matters, I noticed Mr. Survejor Phillips and three jor four local gentlemen going over the different routes. I hope it comes to something this time, as a railway to Bauple is badly wanted. Heavy bushfires are reported to be raging in various parts of the district, and passengers fromj)Pialba by the train last evening state that both sides of the line were also in a blaze iri'many places. It is -to jbe hoped that rain will shortly fall or the result will be serious, aB stockowncrs complain of great scarcity of both grass and water, and these fires will burn up what poor feed is left for the unfortunate animals. The Sydney Senior Examinations will be , continued to-day for which the following arrangements have been made : â€”Morning subject : Higher Latin. Committee : Mrs. Fenny, Rev. Boyall. Aft
