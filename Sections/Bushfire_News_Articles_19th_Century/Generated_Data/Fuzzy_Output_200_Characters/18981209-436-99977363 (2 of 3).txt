 in two or three years, farmers and pastoralistB should not be lulled into a sense of false security ia not taking the necessary precau tions. One objection that 13 raised against in curring the trouble and expense of forming firebreaks is that the fire driven by a gale of wind will often leap across a break 60ft. wide# No doubt ihis will sometimes happen, but under such circumstances it ia bad policy to allow the bush fire to come In full blast up to the break. In sucb a case meeting fire with fire must be prac tised. A fire may safely be lighted to burn against the wind along a break over which the bush-fire would easily leap it if It came up un checked. There are several ways of burning the protecting firebreaks. Where practicable it should be done between plough furrows. Three plough furrows on each side are suffi cient. Of course,' the wider the space between the furrows the better, but it shonld not be less than 60ft. Many stock owners like to burn in the middle of a hot day, but there la always the danger of the fire getting away, and the draught raised by the fire is often bo strong that though tbejire burns fiercely it does not burn clearly, and something Is left t0 carry a bush-fire over
