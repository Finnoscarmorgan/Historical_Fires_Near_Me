een taken, such as strips of green cultivation, ploughed ground, hedges, and so forth, complete protection is as yet out of the power of of even the farmer who culti- vates a comparatively small area. In those circumstances it becomes in the highest degree incumbent on all who pay a due regard to the rights of others to guard against risking property by carelessness in the use of fire. Work- people, travellers, picknickers, and others owe it to the community not to increase the inevitable danger of our severe summers by preventable dangers.
