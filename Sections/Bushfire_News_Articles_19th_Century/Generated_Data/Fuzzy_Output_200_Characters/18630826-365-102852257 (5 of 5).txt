urface of the wood and into the trunk. The trees lose their nourishment and soon die. In many cases, however, the leaves are eaten by cater- pillars, and their vitality is thus greatly im- paired. An attack of caterpillars on the same tree during two seasons generally kills it. Not bush-fires, but the absence of bush-fires, probably furnishes the true explanation of the singular and rapid decay of trees as re- ferred to. Bush- fires at one time were so general every season, that they undoubtedly destroyed millions of insects, as well as the ova deposited in the bark of trees or on their leaves. Since bush-fires have become less frequent, and when they do occur, less violent, in consequence of the natural grasses being kept down by stock, insects have no doubt greatly increased, and it is thus that millions of trees of various kinds are perishing. Why cannot the Emperor Napoleon insure his life? Because no one can be found who can make out his policy.
