 the match would have been drawn instead of lost! Ha! ha ! ha 1 A word or two from our Progress Committee, backed up by the representations of that sage administrator, the Hon. W. J. Lyne, led tbe Postmaster-General to send a clock for the Corowa poBt office. It has been put in position, but is almost useless as a town clock. It cannot be seen from the street, but after some search and a general indication of its whereabouts it can be found under the portico. Surely the skill of Corowa carpenters could have devised some means of giving it a safe and conspicuous position outside. For some days a large bush-fire has been burning on Mahonga run, and in the neighbourhood of Goombargana.. The reflection of it could be seen of a night in Corowa. Bain, in a terrific downpour, fell at Mulwala station on Monday, 21th ult., no less than 2'9o inches falling within two hours. Corowa had a dust-storm, but no rain.
