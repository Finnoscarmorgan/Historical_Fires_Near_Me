ing a good wide belt of land burnt over around them. This should be done on a perfectly calm day, and with plenty of attendants to keep the fire from spreading too rapidly. It is easily beaten out with a green bough while kept under proper control, but many of the disasters of Black Thursday arose from the flames getting the upper hand which were originally kindled as a safeguard. There is a very stringent Act directing due notice to be given to neighbors when this precaution is to be adopted. But after the warnings which have been given, and with the horizon even now daily lighted up by the glare of bush fires, no sane man who has property to guard will delay the most vigorous measures of precaution. The circle of safety should be quite complete, so as entirely to isolate the property to be secured; it should be very wide, so as to guard against the consequences of great heat and a high wind; it should be formed during a calm day, and with ample assistance at disposal. We trust that our up country brethren will aid us in averting serious disaster by echoing our warnings. There is not a day to spare.
