HOBART. Friday. Tile steamer Wakefield brought from one of "the west coast ports a man named Kelly, who had been fossicking in the vicinity of the Lind goldfields. The man lived alone in a hut, and became destitute. He contracted a skin disease ; while in this plight bushfires occurred and caught his hut and burned it down. Kelly saved himself by crawl- ing into an adjoining creek; he was eventually discovered by some miners after having been a number of days in difficulties. The man was in a most deplorable condition, being covered with ver- min ; blowflies had attacked him ; he was also Cun sidcrably burned.
