o'slake his thirst whenas the smoke Of quenchless. bush-fires foul, or dust-storms made him choke." Talking of bush fires, I am reminded of an ancient saint's day religiously observed by the wool-combers of Bradford and other English towns, who are accustomed to hold a septennial jubilee on February 3 in honour of St. Blaize. The chronicler adds :-" There was also a general popular observance of St. Blaize's day in England. Apparently for no better reason than, the sound of the venerated prelate's name, it was customary to light fires on this day or evening on the hilltops." May not the prevalence of bush fixes in the hills of late be looked upon as an indication that even in South Australia there are many who still do honour to the Armenian Bishop ? Be this as it May, or rather as it's February, all the days of this month thus far might appropriately enough be called St. Blaize's.
