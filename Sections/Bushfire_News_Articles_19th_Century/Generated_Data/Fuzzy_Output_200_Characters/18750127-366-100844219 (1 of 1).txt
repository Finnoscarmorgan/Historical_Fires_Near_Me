ave again com menced operations. Arson.- A case of arson has occurred; but as judicial proceedings are about being instituted, I re frain from giving full particulars. Accident.--The kerosene in one of the lamps used in Mr. Colburt's store ignited bursting the basin, and destroying goods, fortunately to a very small amount. Kangarooing.-Hunting these animals is now quite the rage. A few days ago one was killed at Crooked Corner measuring 7 feet 6 inches from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail which weighed 8 lb., and the skin as soon as taken off 8½ lb. Weather.-It is exceedingly dry, and the bush- fires are making sad havoc of the grass, which at Peelwood is so scarce as to cause a settler in that neighbourhood to settle his price for hay at the stack at £10 per ton. 18th January.
