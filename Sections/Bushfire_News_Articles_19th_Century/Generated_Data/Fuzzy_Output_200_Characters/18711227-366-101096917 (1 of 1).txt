COMMEU LCJOAL. WAGGA WAGGA, Friday. Tee weather during the past week has been suffo catingly hot, and the country is in consequence be ginoing to.dry up fast, and the water in some in stances to run very low. Some little food has been damaged by bush-fires since the last rains, but they have generally been got under before they have had much time to spread, and on the whole, the damage done has been far less considerable thainin other districts. Stock are all in good condition, and very free from disease, and the English wool news being extremely satisflctory, pastoralists may look to the future with confidence. In some parts of the dis trict the grasshoppers have appeared in groat num bers, and have destroyed a good deal of feed, and both in Victoria and South Australia have also created terrible havoc.
