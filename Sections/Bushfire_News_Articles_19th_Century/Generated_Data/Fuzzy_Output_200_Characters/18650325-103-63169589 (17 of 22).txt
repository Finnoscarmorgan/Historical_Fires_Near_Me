ssrs M'Malion and Beau mont have been destroyed, but we believe in both of those cases the crops and buildings were saved. The above are the fullest particulars we have been able to collect, but there is every reason to suppose that the injury sustained by the farmers and others is considerably above what we have recorded. Un- der any circumstances it is a terrible visitation, and wo trust that the public of the district will take steps to alleviate the sufferings of those who have beon rendered houseless by this frightf al oolamity. —M.A.lfcdl, Maroh 1. NEWSTEAD. Newstead wa3 yesterday surrounded by bush fires, and many of the inhabitants are apprehensive for the safety of tho town. As a girl was washing irt Marsden's yard, sparks from a tire lighted outside flow on to a dry duag heap, tho straw immediately ignited, and had it not been for the strenuous oxor tiorts of a score of men, several of tho houses would, most probably have been consumed. Tho bush fire on tho range near the Bridge Inn was, at three o'olock, towering yards high. Sotno horses, startled by the blaze and smoke, broko away, and tho resi dents wore in a stata of oxoitomunt and dread. — M. A. Mail, February 28. MOUNT MORIAC. Moun
