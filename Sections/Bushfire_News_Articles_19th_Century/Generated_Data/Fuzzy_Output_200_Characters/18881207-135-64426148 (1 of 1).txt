flects great credit on the proprietor. One of your respected townsmen, Mr. A. Walker, also owns property in this vicinity, and I assure you we are quite proud to have him as one of us. Tile only thing now needed by the land-owners out here is some sort of light railway, in order to render the carriage of their products equal in cost to those of the districts which are thus favoured. Not only would such a work thoroughly develop the farming in dustry, but it would be the means of access to an almost inexhaustible supply of timber, the carriage of which alone would pay for constructing the railway. The bushfires are raging in and around Jeeraling, and unless rain soon comes, will prove a source of great anxiety to all the selectors, who will be in immediate danger of having their houses burned from over their heads.
