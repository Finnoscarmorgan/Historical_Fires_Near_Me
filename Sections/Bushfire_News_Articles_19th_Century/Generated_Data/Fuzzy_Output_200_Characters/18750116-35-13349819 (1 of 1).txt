The meeting was presided over by Mr. Keightley, P.M., and it was decided, after long consideration, that the testi- monial should take the shape of a solid silver salver, upon which should be plated the surplus money in sovereigns.

Mr. Joseph Aarons last week forwarded a large number of horses, about ninety, I believe, from Naninia for Queensland. On the Bogan bush-fires have been very destructive to fencing. On No 2 West Bogan (Mr. Aarons'), nine and a-half miles of fencing have been burned down. The grass on the run was fortunately saved. January 11.
