The losses, which have taken place in the colony from fluke during the last fifteen years have been enormous, and on many runs the death of sheep. are in advance of the number of lambs weaned. 11. No cure for fluke is known; but drainage, the avoidance of swampy pasturage, a plentiful allowance of nutri tious food (the restoration of our better grasses), with a full supply of salt, will certainly bring the evil within very narrow limits. 12. As sheep not too far gone with fluke will readily fatten on certain pastures; owners should, if possible, get rid of them in good time for this pu
