g the approaching enemy, and at one time Mr Clay had upwards of forty men engaged in cutting off the advance of the flames. Messrs Manning, M'Phail, and several other residents have also been nimilarly employed. The whole of the Whipstick scrub is described as being burning at one time for a distance of about thirty miles. The farmers complain, and apparently not without great reason, of the careless habits of the wood splitters and other bushmen, who either leave fires which are not properly extinguished, or carelessly throw down burning matches after lighting their pipes. Another prolific source of bush-fires is the burning wadding discharged from the guns of the legion of sportsmen, frequenting the scrubby country from Reedy Creek to the plains. The utmost circumspection should be observed by those who are engaged in any bush occupation, as the recklessness of one individual may cause the absolute ruin of a score of persons.

Several smaller firea were observed burning around Bendigo, in the direction of Bullock Creek, RavenBwood, and the Whipstick. Thb Bendigo Hospital.â€”The report of this institu
