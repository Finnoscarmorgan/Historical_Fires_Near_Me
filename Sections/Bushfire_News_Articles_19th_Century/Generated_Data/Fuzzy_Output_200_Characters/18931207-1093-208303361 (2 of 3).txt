The cause of the fire is at present unknown. Milang, December 6. The fierce heat of yesterday started a terrific bush fire in the vicinity of Campbell Park, a run some twelve miles from Meningie.

No details have come to hand concerning the damage done, but from the magnitude of the fire it must have been considerable. Melrose, December 4.
