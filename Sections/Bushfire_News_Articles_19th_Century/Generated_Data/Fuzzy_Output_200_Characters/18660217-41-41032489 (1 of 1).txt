ts. Mr. Percy Hedley, a young man who has been living here for some years, died somewhat suddenly on Sunday afternoon. He had been very intemperate in his habits, but did not appear to be worse on that day than he had been for some time. He was out till about 4 o'clock, when he went into the house, lay down, and 10 minutes after he was found dead. Harvesting is drawing to a close. There will be a splendid average this year— not under 20 bushels. Thirty and 35 bushels is a common crop. The steam thrashers— four in number— are all busy at work. The weather continues awfully hot. Judging by appearances, bush-fires must be common in the district at present. ?
