tute, when erected, will be an acquisition to Traralgon South, as a hall of some kind is badly needed here, the accommodation for meetings, entertainments, &c.;,being very limited at present. A tea-meeting, to celebrate the anni versary of the local Sunday School, will be held in the church on Tuesday evening next, when no doubt there will be a good attendance of scholars and the public. The weather has been very hot for a considerable time past, and the grass is drying up fast; a good shower of rain would be very acceptable now. Owing to the length and quantity of grass there will, no doubt, be some bush-fires beom the nsmmer is over.
