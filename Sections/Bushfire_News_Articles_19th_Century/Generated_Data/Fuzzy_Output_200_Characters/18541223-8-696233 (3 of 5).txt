About 4 o'clock in the afternoon of Monday, the town of Goulburn was completely enveloped in smoke, driven in upon us by a series of cross currents of air. The bush on the ranges round the town was one general blaze for Beveral miles, and that part which appeared gloomy in the distance was smouldering and producing a suffocating smoke. In the neighbourhood of Gunning the fires raged j with great fury, and we have been assured by I an eye witness that he travelled 32 miles with almost insupportable bush-fires on each side of him. They extended from Mrs. Howell's station on the Brewer road to with- in two miles of Gunning.
