shaving grass closer than sheep ran on its way, but will, with im- punitv, attack dwellings, stacks, fences, &c.;, without being subject to the expedient of being impounded, which is available to the injured party when stock trespasses. To the carelessness of shepherds in leaving the fire used to prepare their noon-day meal are the ruinous bush-fires of this season mainly at- tributable. If proof is necessary witness the burnt state of the country downwards from Tarcutta along the route sheep travelled up. Your obedient servant, A FARMER, Tumut, 15th December, 1855. [Whilst willing to admit that many bush fires are occasioned by the careless neglect of shepherds or others, we have it from the best of authority that the Gocup run was positively set on fire for the pur- pose of driving off Mr. Rash's flocks;j and we have also had related to us the expressions made use of at the time by the man (?) who did it. At the moment Mr. Rash was leaving Gocup, arrangements were made for a water supply, consequently he then remained. â€” Ed. T. & A. T.] j
