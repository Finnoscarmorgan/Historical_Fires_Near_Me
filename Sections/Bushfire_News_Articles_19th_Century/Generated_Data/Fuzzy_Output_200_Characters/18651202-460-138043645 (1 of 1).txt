able soils (see mangold for remarks upon hoeing). In excavating for reservoirs, ponds, or water-holes, where the bottom and sides arc not retentive (i.e., so as to prevent the eseape of water), claying must not be omitted.Ifriey ctnnot be had, loamy, and even somewhat sandy earth, by abundant working, can be made to retain water. Brindley, the celebrated engineer, was the first to make known and practise this method. Work for the season, each as the ploughing of fallows, harvesting grain j crops, and taking care of a good and dean j sample of seeds for next seed-time, and, above all, guarding against bush-fires, are among the things to be looked to.
