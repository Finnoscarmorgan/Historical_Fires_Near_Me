ayman was awoke at the time mentioned by seeing a glare of fire through her bedroom window. She called her parents, and they then found that the tannery was on .Are. The building was situated about two chains from any other building, and no fire was ever allowed in it. Mr. Hayman estimates his loss at about Â£150. There , will be a coroner's inquiry next week, and the police are making every inquiry, as the whole circumstances seem very suspicious. There was very little wind at i thc time of the lire. The coaches had great difficulty to-day in getting through from Paterson, as there is a large running bush- fire which has been around the old Wallarobba homestead, and has crossed tho road to Mr. Waller's run. It is impossible to say what damago will be done, as at pre- sent there is a high wind, and until it goes down no efforts can stop the fire.
