MOUNT LCCLLS. (FKOM om OWN COWtESPONliENT. ) December IS. l ne residents 01 Mount Lccles have at last woke up to the fact that, if their roads arc to be improved, they must bestir themselves. Two important meetings have been held, and a Roads' Improvement Association formed. On Monday last our roads were inspected by councillors representing tbe North -cast Riding, who were met by some members of tbe local association, and were able to form some slight idea of what tbe roads are like ; but sach a visit should have been pail two or three months ago. A week or two ago, as Mr. Gow was riding home at night, oil a valuable horse belonging to Mr. YL Burgin, boree and rider came to | grief through the roughness of tbe road. The latter escaped without injury, but tbe unfor tunate horse broke his neck. The body of the poor animal was cremated, but It would j not have been difficult to bury it in one of tbe rote or chasms on tbe road. | Crops are poor here as elsewhere. Acres of potatoes have failed to appear, or, as oae farmer said, " They may have grown the j wrong way, to come up tbe other ride/' Our Mount and Like arc looking beautiful just now. The shrubs down tbe rocky sides of the cliffs arc in full bloom, forming a liuc contraat to the dark-grecu ferns. There will doubtless be numerous visitors to this pretty spot during the coming holidays. Snakes have returned with summer, num bers having been killed already. Owing to tbe dry season it Is expected that there will be mauy and large bush-fires this summer. Indeed, the' have commenced already. Cricket in this district seems to have been supplemented by tbe Martiui-Heuri, but the old national game will revive by-aod-bye, when the novelty of the rifle will have worn off.
