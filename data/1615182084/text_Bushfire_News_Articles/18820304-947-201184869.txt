The coasting steamer Kjimeruka, bound from Eden to Sydney, .came into .collisipnxwith.a, ketch at half-past 1 o'clock, on the morning of. 25th February, about six- miles off ?' Beeoroft Point.

Captain Murdoch states that he left the island on the 24th January, andex~ perienced light easterly winds the whole of the ; passage,'' which was' devoid of anything of an ex citing nature, and a splendid trip was made to. Launceaton. The first land was sighted on Thursday last, when Cape Howe bove in' sight. Tamar Heads were seen on Saturday . morning early, and the bark was delayed fop three houra owing to the intense haze then prevailing. The Heads were entered at 2*48 p.m. on Saturday,' and got up the river aa far as Ste'phensohY Bend, where she touched the mud, and. stayed there till Sunday' morning, ? when she was. hove' off, but could not get up to the wharf, there being no wind till evening, and then adverse. A ''Bidden -squall 'from the southward at 6 p.m. drove the bark ashore again, and the services of ? the,tug had to be.tibtained on Tuesday morning, i cthe wharf rbeing reached as above.

Captain Berry, who appears to be very muoh depressed over the loss of his vessel, has made successful voyages in her. for the past, three and a-half years, the last being to Lyttelton (NfZ.), whence he returned to Hamburg. From an abstract of this voyage he supplies the following particulars : — ' We left Hamburg for Sydney oh October 26, with a Crew consisting principally. ? of Germans and. Norwegians. . Nothing of, importance transpired till the 14th February. When I came np on deck at midnight, I noticed a bank on the port . bow, and I asked the aeoond mate whether it ?' - 'was rising or passing away, and he said it was ; pasting iaway.
