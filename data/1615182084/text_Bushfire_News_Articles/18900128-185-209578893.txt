SNAKE VALLEY. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) The secretary of the Carngham Widows and Orphan’s Fund desires to acknowledge with thanks the receipt, per Mr Christie, of £1 from Mr E. Rowlands as a donation to- wards the funds. The first bush-fire of the season in this locality occurred at noon ou Sunday ou a portion of the timber reserve adjoining the properties of Messrs lla.ll and Mathersou. The fire rapidly spread into the paddock of the latter, aud from the quantity of under growth the heat from the fire was in tense which made it anything but au easy task for the few fire-fighters preseut at time, viz., the local police aud two others, to stay the progress; however, they were suc cessful iu keeping the lire- from spreadiug to any great extent until reinforcements arrived, when after a couple of hours hard wirk the work of destruction was stayed.' Had the fire got a good hold before assist ance arrived there is no doubt I would have' to chronicle disastrous results, as there,is au immense quantity of grass all through the plains, west of where the fire originated.
