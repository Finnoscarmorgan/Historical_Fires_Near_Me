GTJICHEN BAY. Bobi>, {larch 9. rom our own Correspondent.j ■rue usual quiet aud monotony of this place baa been broken hy several incidents since my last. One of them was a boat race, which took place on the 3rd lost., between the sailors of the George Kidd and some parties residing here, for a purse of 9s. The two boats were pulled by the contending patties, twice fiom the Jetty to the woolship and back (a distance ot about mile). The sailors won, bat not very easily, being pnsLed very hard by the i«n<tam<ai>. The contest excited, considerable interest, as was shown by the numbers who were on the beach to witness the sport. A raeetiDgof the Bobe Volunteer Bifle Corps was held at the Bobe Hotel on the Sth inst., when the following gentlemen were elected to act as officers to the corps Sir. W. P. Walker, Captain; Me. E. Squire, Lieutenant; Messrs. J. G. O'Keeffe and John Ehers, Sergeants; and Messrs. Hodson, Venn, Coles, and McLean, Corporals. The corps numbered 38 privates in addition to the officers on that occasion, and nearly 20 more have since joined. The Ant did net reach this port till 10 a.m. on Thurs day, having laid in Lacepede Bay for the night. A great many settlers are at present in the township, the election business having drawn some, and o hers to see Mr. David Power off in the Ant to-day, that gentle man being about to leave this distiict to reside in Adelaide. The weather daring the past week has been very fine, although rather windy. SettlerB complain that the country is very dry, and that they want water very badly. The bush-fires have not all done for the season. One was burning within a few miles of the bay yesterday and last night.
