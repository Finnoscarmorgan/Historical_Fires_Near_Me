MURRENDALE. ("From our own Correspondent.) March 2. The weather up to a fortnight ago was rather favorable for the district but this -last week or ten days has heen extremely hot, and, at the present moment, the heat iu the shade here was 100 degrees at two o'clock. A change has taken place within the last half- hour, and thunder is to be heard in the distance with every indication of a storm, which would" be very acceptable justnojv as there are several bush- fires raging in the district. Referring to the sheep smuggling case in which Mr G. 3. Johnson was recently implicated, I for one was very sorry to hear of it as Mr. J ohnson is one of the leading men in and around his district and is undoubtedly one ot the best friends in the district to the working man. To my knowledge, lie employs more families and finds the means for filling' the mouths of more families than any ten squatters in Monaro. I am only sorry that he has not got Â£10,000 a year, as it would be a good thing for laboring men.
