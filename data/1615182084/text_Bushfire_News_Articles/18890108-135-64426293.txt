TOONGkBBIB. (FROM OURE OWi CORErSPODEST.) January 7. The splendid rain we have had has done a great amount of good, and if the warm showers we are haring ca tinue, weshall have grass equal to any former spring. The bushfires in the early mart of the st~,mer, though disastrocs as the time, will be of imee:se value now, as the rain will bring on the ýrass so, and we anticipate a splendid autumn, so those in favour of the farmers common here ought to be up and doing. Mr. A. Harris has been with us and met with a rery cordial greeting, for we can all testify to his being a hard working and zealous member at all times. We are to have a children's picnic on Wednesday next About £7 has already been collected, besides heaps of promises of cakes, tarts and other good things, so our young folks are sure to enjoy themselves. A good number of people mustered on Saturday last to see another race between the local ponies Canary and Polly. Polly was backed against the former at li0to £5,audthoughprevious to reaching the course there were a few outside bets, Canary started at level half-crowns. Polly got a slight start, but Canary was soon on level terms, and, although he was hard held, won by about ten lengths, Polly finishing under the whip. In justice to Canary, I may mention that when ther ran at the sports on New Year's Day his shoes were to have been removed prior to the race, but through the tools being mislaid he had to start with each of his front shoes in two pieces, and they were so smooth and round that he had no foothold, whereas Polly was rough shod for the occasion. This, and the faict of Canary being so much smaller than the otlher pony, was greatly against the former, although his con dition was superior. W. Heywood rode Polly and L. Semruens Canary, this being the latter's fifth win out of six mounts during the last month.
