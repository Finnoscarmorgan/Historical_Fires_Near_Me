POST ELLIOT. fFrom our own Correspondent.] February 24-. Yesterday morning, about 5 o'clock, it was dis covered by a few persons in Port Elliot, that a large fire had broken out near Hindmai-sh Valley; but this report not being generally known, the township was all quiet till a police- trooper came with the in telligence that the fire was fast spreading its way into the Valley. The Rev. J. Hotham was conduct ing service in the Congregational Chapel when, the news arrived, and hastily closed the proceedings. The male portion of the congregation immediately set out for the Valley, in hopes of rendering assist ance if required. It was found that the fire was not so near as was at first anticipated ; and, fortunately for Huadmarsb. Valley, the wind changed, which no doubt assisted to drive the flames in another direction. It is now generally supposed that the fire, which raged to such an extent yesterday, is a continuation of a bush-fire which commenced somewhere near the Square Waterhole, arid has been quietly winding its way through the gullies and ranges until it made its presence known to the inhabitants of the Inman, Hindmarsh Valley, and Encounter Bay. Up till a late hour last evening the fire had not succeeded in entering the Hindmarsh, but was reported to have passed through a portion of the Inman, and the last I heard of it was, that it had reached the sorub be hind Encounter Bay, and was making its way west ward. The Gem arrived on Thursday, and sailed on Satur day night or Sunday morning. The steamer Murray arrived on Friday, and sailed on Saturday evening. The schooner Walrus has just put in for a cargo of wheat. The weather has been extremely warm for the last few days.
