GL E.WGr rtitV. (R,,o, OUR. ON CORRESPONDENT.) Feb. 25. The rainfall I mentioned in my last was not of long duration, and consequently did not do much good to grass land; salthough not very bene ficial in that respect, it has, neverthe. less, been the means of dispelling the sultriness experienced previous to its downfall, and hsa had the effect of making the atmosphere cool and enervating; and of extinguishing .all bush-fires about here. Mr. J. M'Ewan is making good headway with his contract near Scarne Bridge, having completed all the roughing out, and he. is now busily engaged making the culverts. The road when completed will be appreciated by those who journey to Traralgon from here. A race for Â£5 aside took place on Saturday morning, between Mr. Thom son's well known pony Jess, and Mr. J. Bermingham's Starlight, and re ailted in an easy win for Jess by neatly 100 yards. There evidently is plenty of loose cash is Glengarry yet, aotwithstandi.g the bad times.
