AGRICULTURE. "With regard to the agricultural and pastoral interests we have nothing satisfac tory to report. The threshing-machines are busy all over the colony, but generally speaking they tell a sad tale. Crops yield ing fifteen bushels to the acre are excep tions ; many crops have not been, worth cutting, and others have not yielded above five bu4>els to the acre. This has been one of the dryest summers we have ever experienced; bushftres have been raging all over the colony; there is nothing for the sheep and cattle to eat, and scores of these animals can be seen lying dead in all directions, their putrid carcases tainting the atmosphere. Encouraging reports have been received of the wheat in the Upper Jlurray and Ararat districts, and in Gipps land the crops have been well spoken of, but we must wait until we hear the result of the numerous bushfires that have there been raging before we can venture to express any decided opinion as to the yield. As an instance of the drought we might mention that in the Shire of Bellarine, a district generally well provided with water, farmers sad others have been obliged to * ■ travel six and' seven miles for a supply of that most necessary article, even for drink ing purposes; and the same will apply to the district between Cowie'sCreck and Gee long. Thelarmers atDuckponds and Little River have been compelled to drive their cattle to the Ranges; had they not done this they must- infallibly have perished. This great drought has caused public at tention to be attracted towards Abyssinian tube-wells, of which we hope soon to sec a good supply in the colony. To add to this intelligence, we might state that, what the drought has spared, the myriads of grass hoppers that now infest the country are destroying. These are stripping the vines of their leaves, and causing the fruit to wither in the sun. How this will end if rain does not come is easy" to foresee— hundreds of settlers and farmers will he ruined. -
