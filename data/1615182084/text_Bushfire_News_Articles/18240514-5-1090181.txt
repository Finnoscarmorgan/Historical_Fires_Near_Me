TRIBUTARY LINES, Addressed to LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SORELL, on his expected departure for England. VIVE VALE! A minstrel youth, who ne'er abased his strain To laud the guilty, or elate the vain; Who ne'er was tutor'd in the hireling's art Of feigning love with hatred at his heart, And ne'er "to dumb forgetfulness" con- sign'd One obligation due thy noble mind; Roused, honorably rous'd, attunes each string, And plumes imagination's rainbow wing; Then woos for thee, and thine, all hope descries In earth's elysium, or celestial skies! By thee, poartray'd ennobled and adorn'd, Tasmanian prospects are no longer scorn'd: But wealth, rank, loveliness, explore each wild, Impervious deem'd until thy genius smiled. 'Twas thine the Isle's importance to reveal, And urge the Crown to sanctify its weal; To spread Religion's banner on the shore Erst trod by savages, and bronz'd with gore; Enguard from tyranny sad Exile's band, And irrigate with sympathy the land! 'Tis thine to leave a sapling of esteem, Which, gratitude shall nourish with her beam, And time dilate, into a beauteous tree Of amaranthine glory-wreaths, for thee! Nor let the bard's anticipations closeâ€” For, 'twill be thine, when midnight brings repose In Albion's clime, where virgin lustre taints E'en Houri-charms, though Mahommed depaints, To haunt again, the Derwent's fairy stream; Re-view the wild-man's wilder bush-fire gleam; Expand with rapture, as the southern day Melts yon blue mountain mist, and gilds each spray; Live o'er thy sacred seven years in peace, And wear a triumph, ne'er excelled by Greece!
