MEADOW FLAT FROM A CORRESPONDENT Since Friday last the neighbourhood of Mount Lambey has had one dense atmosphere of cloud and smoke, the fires raging on every side of the road from the top of Mount Lambey to Meadow Flat, every hut, house, and station, crops and everything else being in danger of being swept away by the fire. Mr. Murray's place with great exertion was saved; when the fire reached Thorp's Pinch and was raging on both sides of the road ; the neighbours collected together, and headed by Mr. Walter Powell, agreed to start a train of fire outside the boundary fences of all the small farms which abound in that neighbourhood, and as many as could conveniently be mustered, at once set to work close to the roadside above Mr Jamison's, a small settler who resides at the foot of Thorp's Pinch. They had gone about 200 yards along the side of his fence lighting and clearing away from his paddock to the raging bush fire, when a whirlwind passed over Mr. Jamison's house carrying with it a quantity of burning leaves which fell on the thatch and set the whole house in a flame in one moment. The house was burned to the ground in one hour, nothing at all could be saved worth noticing. Â£12 in cash, two sides of bacon, beef, sugar, tea, and a very comfortable bouse were consumed. Jamison is an honest, hard- working man, and has a large family of children, now left without a house to shelter them. Through the goodness of friends there is some talk of a subscription being at once set on foot to which I trust all parties will contribute to assist them in their time of need.
