Saekclotli for Stoddart's Team. (With apologies to the ghost of Tennyson). Many a league, many a league, Many a league onward, P.ight to Australia's shores The English team wandered. I'm going, Stoddart said, Now will you boys be led, To where you'll be well fed, And entertained. Play up, by bonny blades, Don't mind the lights or shades, Or bush fires' smoke. Don't mind the festive fly, They may get in your eye, Just as Jones bowls. Fieldsmen to the right of them* Fieldsmen to tbe left of them, The bowler in front of them Volleyed and thundered. Howled either slow or fast, The British could not last But sorely blundered. Flashed all their willows bare Flashed as they turned in air, Cutting or slipping there Whilst the crowd wondered. Plunged in the bushfires' smoke, Struck, when the wicket broke. Rangi and Mac and Hirst, Deemed they were men accursed, Barrack to right of them, Barrack to left of them, Chiaek behind them, Volleyed and thundered. Stormed at with chaff and shout, By toff, mudlark and lout, : Mid dainty ladies' sneers, And English Johnnys' jeers, They left the field. When shall the story fade, Of the wretched show they made. All the world wondered. " Sackcloth :i for Stcddart's team, Si Ashes " they could not win. Let them go home. JOKER in the Mining Revii'ir,
