AURORA AUSTRALIS. (On the 2nd of September, 1859.) During the period from the 29th of August — the first display of the Aurora—to the 2nd of September, the magnets were more or less dis- turbed. Both inclination and intensity in- creased soon after the last streamers of this phenomenon had been observed. The following table gives the mean values for those elements in the period above alluded to: - Declination. Intensity.

Throughout the 31st of August a strong gale blew from the north, causing clouds of dust to be whirled up. The mean pressure of air for the 2nd was 0.114 below the mean for the month of August. The mean temperature amounted to 51.0 deg., which value is equal to the mean temperature for the month of August. The maximum in tem- perature of air for the 2nd was 62.2 deg., being 3.4 deg. above the mean of the maxima for the month of August ; and the minimum in tempera- ture of air was 43.1 deg., being 1.1 deg. below the mean of the minima for the month of August. In the afternoon of the 2nd of September a gentle breeze set in from E.S.E., with a rising barometer— the mean for the day being 29.893 inches; and there was nothing particularly ob- servable, with the exception of some very fine windtrees in the upper regions of the atmosphere. At about 3.30 p.m., the magnetic elements began to be disturbed, and at 4 p.m. these dis- turbances assumed such a character that a dis- play of an Aurora Australis could be predicted with certainty ; but it was not until 6.19 p.m. that the first faint traces became visible in the S.E. sky, partially covered with cirro-stratus clouds. The following extracts from the registers of the Observatory contain the principal features of this display of the Aurora, the first of which was so splendidly seen only a few days ago (on the 29th August) :— September 2. 6.19 p.m.-First trace of the Aurora seen in S.E. ½E. A small patch of a reddish colour first appeared, and rapidly in- creased in brightness. 6.24 p.m.-Red from S.E. to S.E. by E., very distinct. 6.32 p.m.-Traces of red rays in S.W. The red patch in S.E. increasing in size and intensity. The S. sky very cloudy. 6.39 p.m. -The red rays in S.E. reaching almost to the zenith. 6.46 p.m.-Still brighter in S.E. by E., very cloudy, slightly red towards S.W. 6.55 p.m.-The red in S.E. as before. 7.12 p.m.-The red from S.S.E. to S.E. 7.18 p.m.-The clouds clearing away. 7.26 p.m.-The red as before. White light in south. 7.37 p.m.-Red from S.W. by S. to S.E. by E., much brighter than before. 7.43 p.m.-Fine white streamers in S.E. 7.48 p.m.-A faint arc visible, the lower edge coloured, passing through Achernar and Southern Cross. 7.49. p.m.-First streamers of crimson red. Several very bright streamers from S.E. to S.S.E. 7.55 p.m. -A very bright white streamer in S.E. 8.0 p.m.-Two fine red streamers, S.E. by S. 8.1 p.m.-Beautiful red and white streamers in S.E. by E., and also dark bands. The sky assumed the most remarkable tints. The dif- ferent colours blending into each other, gave the whole an effect of a veil extending over the sky ; clouds slightly moving towards south, apparently of a very delicate construction. A corona round the moon, with very pale colours. 8.13 p.m.-Beautiful red and white in S.E. 8.15 p.m.-More red towards S.W. ½ S., and the edge of the red sharply defined towards W. Dark streamers in S.E. 8.16 p.m.-Broad streamers of lights constantly changing position in S.S.E. and S. 8.21 p.m.-A grey sigment in south. Canopus clearly visible through it. Brightest light now in S.E. 8.24 p.m.-The red moving farther towards the east. 8.37 p.m.-Streamers in S. by E. In west and cast a slight reddish tint. 8.39 p.m.-White streamers in the astronomi- cal meridian towards south. 8.43 p.m.-A streamer passing exactly through E. and S. Argo. The above mentioned clouds passing very slowly towards south. 8.46 p.m. - A light reddish tint, through which the maghellan clouds remained visible. 8.51 p.m.-Brightest light towards the Southern Cross. 9.5 p.m.-Reddish tint 2 deg. above Phoenix. 9.16 p.m.-Bright streamers passing through the little maghellan clouds. 9.17 p.m.-Four streamers S. by E. 9.20 p.m.- Streamer through maghellan clouds. 7.32 p.m.-The S. by E. portion of sky the brightest. Red in E. and W. The whole phenomenon faded away, so that no observations were made from 9.32 to 9.56, but it sprung up again at 9.57 p.m., when it appeared in great bril- liancy. The grey segment above the horizon more distinct, the upper margin touching a band of silver light extending from W.S.W. to S.E., to a height of 10 deg. Rays of lights shoot up in the direction of the Southern Cross. 10.7 p.m.-The rays, or streamers, appear more diffused, and extend from Phoenix down to horizon, with a breadth between Phoenix and Achernar. They are also very brilliant in the constellations Lupus and Scorpio, in the latter from the tail down to the horizon. 10.10. p.m.-The light more diffused in Centaur and Southern Cross, and broad rays appear again between the tail of Scorpio and the silver segment. The most brilliant contrasts of colour, and changes from red and pink to white, through a light but bright green and yellow in the silver segment, give the whole phenomenon the most marvellously beautiful effect. 10.12 p.m.-Streamers through B. Centaur, towards the silver segment. The whole appear- ance of light now extends from E. to W.

Red light in S.E., and faint diffused light in W.N.W. During the whole time of the display of the Aurora Australis magnetic and electrical obser- vations having been made, the following results were obtained. I have mentioned already that the magnetic disturbances commenced at about 3.30 p.m. on the 2nd, and at this time the decli- nation, intensity, and inclination instruments could not be registered, as the scales were out of the field of the telescopes. By the re-appearing of the same it could be seen that an increase in declination and horizontal intensity had caused the disturbances alluded to. The instruments continued to be violently disturbed until after 1 a.m. on the 3rd. when they became quieter, although far from their normal readings. The following figures show the state of the magnetic declination and horizontal intensity from 4 p.m. on the 2nd, to 9 a.m. on the 3rd, in hourly means:-- Declination. Hor. Intensity. H. M. Deg. Min. Between 4 and 5 p.m. ..8 45-32 E. .. 2-36271 8 58-84 E. .. 2-36010 8 45-61 E. .. 2.34941 8 39-12 E. .. 2.34388 8 32-26 E. .. 2.35184 8 38-56 E. .. 2.35313 8 29-21 E. .. 2.35210 8 29-42 E. .. 2.34513 8 28-34 E. .. 2.35868 "1 2" ..8 28-84 E. .. 2.34470 "2 3" ..8 24-84 E. .. 2.34534 "3 4 " ..8 29-56 E. .. 2.34460 "4 5" ..8 36-20 E. .. 2.34661 "5 6 " ..8 36-20 E, .. 2.24948 "8 9" ..8 31-10 E. .. 2.25256 As above mentioned, these results represent the means of all the readings between the consecu- tive hours, and have been obtained by 1,110 single readings, which number was distributed over the single hours. By comparing these mean values for the single hours with the mean value of the magnetic element for the preceding 10 days, we may form an idea as to the amount of disturbance. These mean values for the period between the 19th and 28th August are 8 deg. 29.6 min. E. in declina- tion, and 2.36089 in horizontal intensity. We see at once how both these elements increased in the commencement of the magnetic storm, how the declination after 6 a.m. decreased until 3 p.m. on the 3rd, and how the intensity was subjected to oscillations of shorter duration, keeping below the above-mentioned normal value. Through the kindness of W. James, Esq., tele- graphic station-master in Melbourne, I was in- formed that on the 2nd September a disturbance in the electric telegraph wires was felt in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, simi- lar to that felt on the 29th of August. It appears by the reports from different loca- lities that no disturbances in atmospheric elec tricity were observed during the whole period; and I subjoin here the results of hourly electrical observations for the 31st August, September 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, made at the Observatory. 5 6 » 1 .. 8 » » " 10 " 11 Midnight " Midnight 1 a.m. 10 Wed- , - nesday.

What makes this occurrence of the Aurora Australis particularly interesting is the splendidly developed crown, lasting nearly for two hours ; and if we adapt the above-named stars in Capricornus as having been near the centre of the crown, the altitude of the latter above the horizon, was 66 deg. 30 min.-a value which nearly coin- cides with the dip of the needle here, namely, 67 deg. 12 min. The phenomenon was observed in different parts of the country, and reports thereon have reached me from the following localities :- " Ballaarat.-The Aurora Australis was visible from 6.45 p.m. on the 2nd; until 2 a.m. on the 3rd. A dull redness, changing to pink and grey, in the southern sky, which quickly spread east and west, cloudy till 9-the appearance more like the reflection of a bush-fire. At 10 the aurora beautiful, and rays distinct. At 10.30 it was seen in the east and south-west, and the southern part of the sky was illuminated till 2 a. m., when rain commenced to fall."-(J. H. Taylor, Esq.) Extracts from a letter from H. L. Huyghue, Esq. : -" The speciality of this phenomenon was its extent (embracing as it did the whole heavens), and its vividness of colour, which was a deeper and brighter red than through a long experience I ever behold in a North American aurora, seem- ingly penetrating the clouds, and the singular fact that throughout the display up to the term of observation, 1 o'clock a.m., no rays or play of fanlike coruscations appeared towards the southern pole. " The magnetic discharges assumed the cha- racter of luminous waves transmitted insensibly through a vapoury medium, and bursting out occasionally in a blaze of greater intensity. I noticed coloured circles about the moon. It was very cold until midnight, when the wind shifted to the east." Brisbane Ranges. -R. J. Ellery, Esq., writes to me as follows :-" The weather was very calm and a few clouds in the west and north. The aurora increased every hour till midnight, when it presented the appearance of an equatorial arc of rose-coloured light, flickering through white streamers shooting up from the southern direction. The arc seemed brightest to the westward, but perfect from horizon to horizon. The southern sky was lit up as if by coming sunlight, intense at the horizon. The weather was calm throughout, except for a few seconds at about 10 o'clock, when a single gust from N. or N.N.W. set all our tents flapping, and ceasing as instantaneously as it came on. The rest of the night appeared calm and clear." Shortlands Bluff.-Extract from a letter and report from Wm. Foy, Esq. :-" The phenomenon of Friday night last from its rare occurrence during my time at this station-10 years-has invited my particular attention, and I have made an attempt to note the various changes from its commencement to its disappearance (of which the following note alone is here ex- tracted). "12.10 a.m.-A sudden change took place, sur- passing in grandeur any of the previous changes. A dense red centred at the zenith, which sud- denly shot out with rapid extension in white streamers, intermingled with red to the horizon, spreading from W. to E. round south, having so magnificent an appearance that I know nothing to compare it to. This continued for about 10 minutes, the luminosity being very bright." During the morning of the 3rd of September, between 9 and 12, the silver arc of the light could be seen, notwithstanding the brightness of the sun ; and on the morning of the 4th and the evening of the 5th, further occurrences of the Aurora Australis have been observed, although of by far less brilliancy and by far shorter dura- tion than on the present occasion. Worthy of notice is the fact, that during the whole period of these frequent magnetic storms and disturbances not a single halo round the sun or the moon could be seen, although the greatest attention was paid to this subject and the greatest care was taken not to miss any observation of this nature. The last halo registered occurred at 10 p.m. on the 17th of August, when traces of an auroral light were visible in S. S. W. GEORGE NEUMAYER. Flagstaff Observatory, September
