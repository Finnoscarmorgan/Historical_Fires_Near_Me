ANOTHER VICTORIAN BLACK THURSDAY. The Kilmoro correspondent of the Melbourne Akgus ttates that bushfires are raging in the. neighbourhood, and teleetors are experiencing a repetition of Black Thursday. The belt con tinues to be intense, and is aggravated by the presence of the numerous fires raging. The most extensive fire is one that has been burning bouig days on the Sunday Creek and Tallarook moun tains, where some thousands of acres of grass lanas nave oeen destroyed, cogetner wicn many milea of fencing. The. whole of these range3 are in flames, which, fanned by variable winds, drive in all directions, destroying everything which comes in their way. Several farmers in the Flowerdale and other districts have suffered severely, and reports are to hand of the destruc tion of some homesteads. The fire from Sunday Creek to Tallarook ranges 13 estimated to be from 10 to 12 miles in length. The Goldie Company's mining plant at the Kilmore Diggings narrowly escaped destmction when the fire at Mount Wil liam was at its height. Farmers and miners alike strove hard, and were successful in saving the engine-house and mining plant, but a quantity of timber was burnt.
