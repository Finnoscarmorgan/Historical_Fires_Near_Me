Tas "Weather. Except that the break in the weather on Sunday hal given us reason to hope for more rain, we cannot yet congratulate ourselves on any cheering result following upon the change The showers in Single ton on Sunday were light, but they were heavier and of longer duration m Newcastle and on the Upper Paterson Nothing particular came of the cloudy Monday, and Tuesday was a warm day but not so hot as the broiling dajs of last week In the even ing there was a thunderstorm, which spent itself over a wide area, and jielded a little hea\y rain The shower was brief in Maitland, but 1 sted for about a quarter of an hour m ïiewcistle, the dis charge being copious while it continued Tho visitation has yet been very partial, our Moun* Vincent correspondent makes no mention of any rain falling there, and the blackness caused bj bush fires continues, without any moisture ha\rag come to cause the burnt grass to spring anew \esterdaj, at Maitland, was cloudy, and promising for ram The air was chilly in the evening Further north there has been ram, as our readers will be glad to see from our Gunnedah correspondent's letter And the following is good news from Liverpool Plains, the authority being the Tamworth News of Tuesday - Since our last issue a welcome change in the weather has taken place, and revived the drooping spnits of hundreds who looked forward despondently to the future For several months past but little rain had fallen, and what with the intense summei heat and the bush fires, vegetation in this locality dwindled away to almost nothing, and the various water- course» had nearly ceased to run The wheat crop was, of course, secured before the dry weather set in , but maize, potatoes, and fodder crops were injured beyond recovery, and hay and maize rose m price till they were rapidly approaching fabulous rates Pastoralists were preparing to travel their stock, and the most serious forebodings were expressed m all parts of the district It is to be hoped the rain we were blessed with yesterday extended over a large area, and relieved the appre- hensions of our flockmasters The whole of last weak waa characterised by weather, the like of which we never experienced on the Plains before To add to the discomfiture arising from the almost intolerable heat, a suffocating atmosphere was pro duced by the bush fires encircling the town for miles round, Saturday and Sunday being particularly dis- tressing in this regard On Sunday evening, however, heavy clouds appeared after the smoke had cleared away by a high wind, and a change was anxiously looked for, but nevertheless most people retired to rest with small hopes of so desirable an event About five a m. on Monday, however, a light shower fell, and was succeeded by others of increasing volume, until about eleven a m, when the rain ceased A great quantity of water fell, but it was almost directly absorbed by the thirsty earth So far as we can learn, the downpour extended to a distance of eight or ten miles down the river, and it has been hailed with great delight Now that the long stretch of dry weather has broken, we may hope strongly . for a more favourable season than has hitherto been experienced
