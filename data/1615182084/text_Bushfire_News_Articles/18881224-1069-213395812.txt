DOINGS OF AN EVENTFUL DAY EMU PARK RAILWAY OPENING (By Zingaro). Whether the realisation of any long-looked for enjoyment ever equals its anticipation, has been a problem on which such acute philosophers as Baloingrten and Herder have expended no little time and trouble We do not intend to put your already long- suffering readers through a course, of Ger- man metaphysics preparatory to, beginning our repiort of the opening of the Emu Park Railway , but this we would premise, that if the visitors who were present on Saturday afternoon at the fete, did not find the actual state of the case correspond with their ex- pectations, it was the fault of neither the Cleerk of the Weather, the Committee into whose hands the arraugements were placed, or the genial caterer, Mr. Harry Johnson of the Belmore Arms. Everything passed off well, and the unanimous verdict of all present was utterable in the lines of Ovid. " Jovo send us more such happy days again." Punctually at 10 ; o'clock, the hour specified upon the invitation card, a goodly company of all the leading gentlemen in Rockhamp- ton, assembled at the North Rockhampton Station,like Chaucer's Canterbury pilgrims, " Ready to wenden on their pilgramage , "To Emu Park with all devoute courage." All sorts and conditions of wayfaring gar- monts were donned for the occasion, com- fort being in every case sensibly considered before the demands of that imperious auto- crat, Fashion. Precisely to time, after the guests had all been conveniently stowed away in tho com- fortable compartments, the train, consisting of an ongine, four composite carriages, and guards van, moved out of NORTH ROCKHAMPTON. A considerable crowd of spectators had as- sembled to witness the starting of the first train over the Emu Park line. Whether their feelings were so completely paralysed by the entrancing interest of the scene, or whether they considered it infra dig to raise a cheer, not the faintest approach to a "huzza" left the lips of the onlookers. Surely the green-eyed monstor had nothing to do with it. Slowly at first but with rapidly, increasing speed, the iron-horse with its burden speeds on its way, leaving the houses of the town- ship of North Rockhampton on the left, and on the right the broad placid bosom of the Fitzroy, shimmering in the golden sunlight with thousands of sparkling dimpling ripples. Upon the verandahs and at the doors of the various houses of the township as we pass, stand the eager enthusiastic re- sidents men, women, and childrenâ€” waving frantically, every thing they could lay hands on from a pinafore to a petticoat, to show their satisfaction that the great work was consum- mated. On we speed. Here (in/is) Devil's. Elbow that beautiful sweep of our great river which for richly contrasted colour is one of the gems of Australian scenery, despite its somewhat uncuphomious designation. Then comes still on the right hand side and overlooking the river, that charming retreat Koongal, the property of John Fairbairn, Esq.; which, howevor, owing to the passage of the railway through : it at an awkward angle; has been so outrageously cut up. Then on the left we catch a glimpse of Mt. Berserker, towering up, with its tree-clad altitude into spruce, and soon our fuming and fretting steed runs panting into LAKES CREEK STATION. But we do not stop here. Though our speed is slowed, nobody being on the spot to be picked up, we continue to rattle ahead. The next feature of interest on the right- hand side of the line is the splendid estab- ment of the Lakes Creek Meat Preserving Company, which for completeness of appoint- ments and labor-saving appliances, will rival any similar establishment south of the line. Here we also note Mount Archer on the left, a prominent and beautiful element in thc varied landscape, and on. the same side the highly desirable site upon where Mr G. S. Curtis proposes shortly to build his resi- dence. We pass now on the right the Champion- ship Sculling Course, and having seen all the stretches of water in the world where the leading sculling matches take place, we are prepared fully to endorse the opinion expressed by Ned .Hanlan , that, the Fitzroy course surpasses them all in every quality which conduces to the welfare and development of this grand branch of athleticism. Here we pass through flats covered with white gum, upon which the stock in vain are endeavoring to find shelter under the withered timber, flicking the flies the while from their tortured sides, with their tails in measured cadence, "forty' flicking as one," with apologies to Wordsworth for the misapplication, of his verse.Yondor is the sawmill on.the right, which we trust is only "the foretaste of better things," as far as the progress of the place is concerned. While meditating thus we flash through SAWMILL SIDING as the place is named meantime, until the occurance of some 0utstanding fact re- christens it more appropriately. Passing on we wind along through a succes- sion of once fertile flats showing sad signs now however both to nose and eye of the prevalent drought, in the carcasses of horses and cattle lying and rotting, here, there, and everywhere. There is a sufficeincy of fine timber here not' large but dense, although we note likewise the smouldering evidences of a gigantic bushfire which had swept in its remorseless and devas- tating career, over hundreds of acres of fine trees. The inevitable poet who always accom- panies such excursions felt the divine affatus seize upon him with a grip like that of Con- stable Macgillicuddy, but we will be merciful and not inflict upon the gentle reader what we suffered from that summer poet.We next rattle on through, the fine property of Robert England, !Esq., which, however, had r suffered heayily from the great bush fire. Here we catch a first glimpse of the famous Mount Schleikna, so named after the celebrated horse of Scandinavian mythology. With regard to this mouniain we cannot but note the striking reseblance it bears, with its triplated summit to the " Eildons three" in Scotland, which the familiar spirit of Michael Scott, the Wizard, cleft into their threefold crests as the work of a night. Nay, the whole scenery here is somewhat sug- gestive of that Paradise of the tweed, where every rood of land is consecrated by tradition, where the waters of every streamlet, are im- mortalised in song. Here the Balnagowan road crosses the line, and winds, away down through the valley by the base of Schleikna, and through the trees we catch a peep of the Balnagowan Hotel, standing by the roadside.Here our iron horse began to slow,and presently we drew up at MEADOW FLATS. near to John McGrath's selection, one of the early settlers in 1868. Here everything looked green and beautiful, betokening a plentiful and perment supply of water. Not long did we delay, how- ever. In a few moments we are again on the road. Keeping Nankin on the right, with the Cawrra skirting the line on the left, we next passed Black-' well's selection on the former side, and Hayes' on the latter, both of them early settlers of the 1868 type. Their land ex- hibits every evidence of industry, persever- ance and foresight. Then as we rattled along merrily. Our tireless steed at this point " laying back its ears" for a bit of a " stretch " along a fine straight run with no curves to trouble it, "we obverve the spur from Mount Schleikna , where the "Annie" and other reefs are situated, and Stoney Creek, which with its dry sterile bed, unre- lieved by vegetation fully deserves up. \- iiio. At a little distance wo nolo Saunter's' .-leotion, looking gr. en and fertile, and .-> lowing a wonderful contrast to tho surf rounding country. Rattling on through this ' iue'property, where the beauty of1 the laud j i icape is relieved by 'lUidry small lagoonsi ! .vliieli gleaming golden in the morning mill: j chine, lend color to the sceno. Onward, onward w,! go, passing Nankin Croeki windirit&jRNvn; by the base of tho hill of tho sam? and finally draw up at . , cawarral ' ' having accomplished tho first half of our journey in exactly 40 minutes. Ilorowenoto the pumping operations wliioh avo' going on to fill the immense \loublo-tier 1-1,000 gallon tank, whence our ongiue proceeds to take ! " water. Also, we are shown the arrange-: i ment which has been made to recompense travelling stock for the loss of the creek , whicli is cut off from tho road by tho lino, in tho shupo of largo troughs communicating hy pipes with tho tank aforesaid: AB we movo out from OiiwiUThl, on our inward course, we perceive on lilie right-hand side the crushing mill belonging to tho Tom Thumb mine. Though/the lal.lei- is situated six miles away, Still the ' stuff" is carted nit that distance, in order to sccuro a pcrmanont supply of water for crushing purposes. Near the creek are lnrgo honps of tailings, yet to I bo treated by the new chlarination urocoss. i Cawarral township is now visible for an in stant on tho loft, with the celebrated Dan Hawk's Half-way House, tlio siglit of which in days gone by was like, mamia tp the soul i of many a dust-choked traveller- between Rockhampton and Emu Park. On the Bamo side also we catah n glimpse of the famous . Mount : Wheeler, whore tho largo alluvial finds wore made in the early days. Long uuu o40 ruuu lo lj iu 11 .lulls wuu1iu 1'ouuu tho base of tho liill. On, the right wo now got a splendid viow, , of Cawarral Station, the residence of John Fergusaon, Esq. It is beautifully situated on the rise of a small liill, having tho diVuse' heavy masses of bush iu the distant back ground to throw it more completely into reli'df. The picture in every rospbet is a beautiful one, full of vivid and effective color and coutrnsts. . Tho channels of tho creeks here, lined as they ore with- 1 drooping palms, are vmy picturesque, and afford : a relief to the eyo from the perpetual varieties of eucalypti. On we speed, until at longth wo renah c00u005ian creek ;- with Mr. Macarce's brewery on the loft, con-: spicuous by its castellated shapo/likb somo ancient Bordor peel immortalised in .the romances of the old niinBtrols;' and in 'the magical reproduction of the cliivalric prist in our glorious Sir Wall " .

It lias.every-; " thing to commend it to the lover of picturesque sceh'ery, the Itfa'vellety the pleasure-seeker, arid the, 'invalid. ' Three 'maghiliccnt .hotels, unsui--' . passed, at leasf;iri the caso.'of ' the two first, ' by ; any. at Manly, Sorrento, ;dr Queeris'cliff, offer ' accommodation to' visitors, viz., Comlcy's Emu' Park,- Birch's' Grand; and Toon's Impbrial. , whilst now that the railway has bcon ripened, ; all sorts of amusements will bo provided by ' the enterprising lessees;' since, as good host Coniley remarked iu his short but raby speooh on Saturday, " it wits his interest so to do." , As ' to the prospect froni the points rif vantage around, the ' lover of ,,tlie picturesque has a constant treat befriro blip. ' stationing himself, on. the tower of Birch's GraridjHotel, the eye wanders entranced over the magnificent expanse of land and sea. Tho bbautiful lines of ICoppel' Bay lib beforo us in their fair entirety, whilst tlio shimmering expanse is dotted by the rocjcyhnd i-uggod outlines of Keppel Island, Pelican Island, and Entrance Island. Round the beach are miiriv delicious walks) where the inevitable spring lovers may find ample scope for the exercise of that easiest of all the arts "spooning." Here also may . the lover forlorn find a coii-: solation by ".the sad sea waves," arid if ho should confide tho secret of 'his trouble to Hosts Cqml'ey and Birch, before ho leaves they will have' brought him to tho somewhat cynical yet nevertheless sensible conclusion, that "there are as good fish in tho scans over came out of it." "All tho passengers then proceeded. to Comley's Hotel, whore Mr. Couiloy' hos pitably entertained tliein. ' ; Captain' Hunter, as a very old resident, groposed " success to Emu Parle," whicli lie adrno doubt was ensured by the complotioh of (he lirio.'

The health was drunk with musical honors. Mr. Murray, in replying, said he was a young and pomewhat simplo member, and that "thtsy" ought to have 'bbupled the toast with somo one or more capable than ho to address: them.'

(Crios of f"No.") He said tho Â£(50,000 whicli had bcon voted, fur tho lino Ouglit to havo been voted for an extontion -of tho Central Railway to the sea board. (Mr. Archor: Whntevor havo. wo got to do with this controversy hero?) It was immaterial tp liim whothpr the railway wont' to 'Pok-t Alma or toany other place.

Tho extension was a work of a national eharautor) and it would not bo influenced by the possi bility that it might nffeot thb interests of a fow tradespeople in Rookhampton. It affected the interests of tlio wholo producers of Central Queensland, anil did thoy tliink those people wero going to bo debarred from getting tlio extension by a few tradespeople in Rockhampton ? He hoped tho extension of! the line would bo the next celebration ho would attend. Ho had to thank them very muoh for proposing and receiving tlio toasti of the Parliament of Quecnsliuidi in t.liei manner they did. (Cheers.) ' ' Mr. Archer thon announced that tlio pro gramme. of the celebration was tlien com- pletod, and thoy - luull got 20 minutes more' to spend at Tanby.

He . had a toast to propose,! which they would all di-iilk witli ploasuro.1 " was uuut or men- esteemed chairman, Mr, Archer. (Hear, hear.) He was quite certain ho would roqniro to say very little. Mr, .Arehor. was one of the oldest inhabitants in the Central Distriot, and during the time that he had known liim, his best services bad been devotod to tho advancement of the Central Distriot. (Hear, bear.) i In his public capacity, Mr. Archer had at times dono thiugs much against his own personal interests for the benofit of the community. Many present did not know: that fact so well as ho did. Upon Pne occasion they could got nothing for tho Central District, and - Mr. Archor was on the ovo of going home, but ho pledged liimsolf to give up his appoint ment to forward the intqrests of Central Queensland. Fow, men in such circumstances would havo carried themselves with tho same integrity arid good feeling whioh) Mi'. Archer had displayed in giving up a .lucrative position for their sakes.
