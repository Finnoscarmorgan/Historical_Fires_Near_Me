WHEEO. (Fro-0 ow correspondulCf.) TIE WVEATun? .-Wo have had a very accoptablo chango in the weather. The present month was ushered in with very high and very cold wind which on Wednesday gave place to a heavy downpour of rain. SThis will.bo highly heneficial to the grass, which in some places was begirnning to dry up, and in faoot some destructivo bush-fires had taken place. There will now be abundance of foodefor the winter; and as the ground is thorouguly saturated, farmoro can commence ploughing as soon as they like. The greater part of the grain about here has boon thrashed out, and a considerable quantity has gone to market, growers fearing a reduction in the market price. I do not however consider there is much grounds for such fuears. Sanitary.-I am sorry to say that eilckness has pro vailed to a great extent amongst both young and old; and euveral have gone to that bourno from whence there is no roturning. It is to be. hoped that the present chango in the weather will be favourable to the health of the people. Horsoustealing has been rife about here lately; in fact there his not a week passes but we hear of some crime being committed between here and Glloen. It therefore seeooms strange that the government are so very dilatory in establishing a police station at Grabben Gullon. March 3rd.
