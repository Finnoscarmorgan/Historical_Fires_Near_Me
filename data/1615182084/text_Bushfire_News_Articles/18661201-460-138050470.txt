But the excessive dryness, com* bined with the purity and elasticity of our atmosphere, is especially fevourable to the constitution of the bone, as it has, been proved to be to that of man. It would be. difficult to name any country more favourably rflitaated for the production of hones in which speed, endurance, and sire are the essential requi sites to be developed than the southern colonies of the Australian continent, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. "Stone bf hge, in his work on the horse, recognises this feet. He says that the climate of Aus tralia is admirably suited to the horse, and that there are colonial-bred horses superior in soundness, and probably in stoutness, even if deficient in pace, as compared with the British thoroughbred. He .even goes so for as to remark-"I strongly suspect that before long we shall have to go to them to prooure Bound horses of high breeding for our own studs." We can easily understand that horses ex ported from these colonies to suffer from change of climate the same as human beings, and in the same way from liver com plaints. But we can hardly believe that, when once acclimatised, the Australian horse would be found more unfit for exposure than other hones. In our hottest weather, when a fierce north wind has been blowing and bush-fires raging, horses have performed journeys of almost fabulous distance with comparative ease; and everyone knows how the majority of bush hones fere when the journey is at ah end, a rub down and a run in the paddock being too often their fete. Doubtless we breed much rubbish, and a good deal of it may have found its way into the Indian market. Neither are we disposed to accept the military authori ties in India as our judges. Price with them is limited, and really good hones, after prime cost» freight, insurance, &c.;, are taken into consideration, cannot be placed in the market under three figures. We have inspected several drafts of horses previously to their shipment for India, and must pronounce many of them to have been good serviceable animnla The conclusion arrived at in India, accord ing to the article in AU the Tear Round, is, that there is nothing like the English thoroughbred after all, and it only astonishes us how such a fad; was not recognised sooner. The fourth experiment, which is pronounced perfectly successful, was "rearing thoroughbred stock in the desert on bard food." This was tried in Arabia, from which country, it seems, the Bupply is now cut off, leading to the establishment of stud farma in Tnitia j£ ^ stated that on a ferm of 2,000 aeras 600 head of hones might be annuallyraisad. If sttch coold be done profitably in Tndii^ a <nm;iar undertaking should be remunerative hf»w. especially when superior thoroughbred stock would find a ready market in Indfr, for undoubtedly thoroughbred hones reared in this colony would be more suitable to that climate than those imported from _ Bre»y year we are receiving fresh importa tions of the best blood from Bnglan^ as well as breeding ourselves, and the rivalry between the colonies must be productive of further improvement in our hone stock. Comparing (be speed attained by the colonial-bred horse with that of the best in Groat Britain, and the ehape, sice, and performances of such horses as Uarragon, Volunteer, and the pick of the Maribyrnong stud, with those of similar merit in the old country, it is very evident that the Australian thoroughbred, before many yews, will attain a very high character, and is not no# far behind his English progenitor. The report of the. prices obtained at Mr. Fisher's sale has no doubt long .ago reached India, and may have opened people's eyes there somewhat to the &ct; that good horses are sot picked qpfor an old song, and that if they would form a correct opinion of the merits of Australian horses they must obtain the best article. Still it most be Admitted that the climate of jn parte etf that rest territory, forbids the idea that the Australian horse oan feverbe as gpdd tbeta as fti hiii 'nfctivi \ Ite nfcust and iweip o^^nar, jj^he,' Jj* depending on the .locality.
