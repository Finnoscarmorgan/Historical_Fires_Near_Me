DESPAIR. List to those wild, appalling cries. That on the wings of the breezes rise, And fill the air ! King Death 's in one of his merry moods, While o'er the thirst v city broods Despair ! Cross those mist-capped mountain chains — Oazo awhile upon yonder plains, Scorched and bare : Thirsty valley and mountain peak, The rocky bed of the dried-up creek. Withered flower and herbage speak Despair ! Seek the shadowy bush at night, Watch the gleaming, glittering light, And the flare Of lurid flame — the bush-fire's glow, Fanned by the sultry winds that blow — Breathe they hope to the settler ? No ! Despair ! Back to tbe city, backward fly ! Soars the sun in the brazen sky : Everywhere Drought and misery — empty wells. Loud the cry of mourning swells, And the sickening tale, which tells Of despair. And what of those who rule the State, Whose fingers toy with the key of fate ? Do they care Aught indeed for the public weal — Aught for the wretches who vainly kneel For deliverance ? Do they feel Despair ? Strive they ever the thirst to quench ? They loll at ease upon padded bench And cushioned chair. Destruction's billows may surge and seethe, Their own vain dreams they calmly wreathe, And take small heed of the cries which breath Despair ! The " bird of Sacred Song" — The Missal thrush.
