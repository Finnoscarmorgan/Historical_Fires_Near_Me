Benefit Race Meeting. Although the race meeting under "the auspioes of the'Kyneton District Racing Club in aid of the funds of the local: Agricultural Society was postponed on Wednesday in consequence of the inclemency of the weather, Thursday, the day en which it -was held, showed TO improvement in this respect. Ji* oourec was in a terribly slippy oonditioo, while Some of the races hart to be run In heaVy nun, making it most unpleasant forofficials patrons, and jockeys alike. At two o*clo<i. thTtime announced for the starting of the first race, the attendance of the pilKtic was hi small that it seemed almost inevitable fEe meeting would be. a rank failure. _ However, shorter after ttat hour a bw ote brought additional visitors frnm BenAgo 4md elsewhere, and. as the afternoon WOK on &e; number mraa further aogipented mtil *fiudf; KespeetaUe crowd had pnt in an tappeftrmnoe, taMnga moneiiyloas, even' if ft *dii «olt in any 'niaterial benefit to the deserring .institution for which the programme .was compiled. Only about a dozen of the gentler sex were present during the afternoon. Had the day been more propitious the attendance woald have been considerably larger, and the meetiug have been most popular. The following were the officials on the oocaxioa:—Judge, Dr Main; starler, Ur 3* B, Hardman; capper, Mr W. E. Bakin; timekeqjer, IlrC. Leaner; pony measurer*, Messrs J. K. "HaMmanandA.
