'EXTENSIVE BUSH FIRES HEAR i CAMPERDOWN. (BY ELECTKIC TELBGKAPH. ) (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) . CAMTERDOWX, Thursday Evening. The bush . fires which prevailed on Tuesday in the Heytesbury forest have been almost entirely extinguished by the heavy rains which have fallen. They proved terribly destructive, and the damage done is estimated to considerably exceed Â£4000. About thirty families have been entirely burnt out, even their wearing apparel being destroyed- In ad dition, miles of expensive fencing have disappeared,and crops are left open to the ravages of rabbits, kangaroos, and other pests, tine man is reported as missing, and a family named Monk had a narrow escape. The husband (Monk) was a? work, and his wife, with eight or nine children, were at their home when the fire came down on the house. The whole of the family at once took to the bush, and the children were very seriously scorched, especially about the feet, through having to walk on the burning embers. The misery of the sufferers has since been intensified by the heavy and continuous rains which have fallen since Tuesday night. No such disaster is believed to have been recorded in the history of the colony in connection with bushfires. The flames spread over a large extent of country, almost from Camperdown back to Apollo Bay, and it is feared the whole of the losses have not yet been recorded. It is proposed here to start a public subscription for the relief of those who have been rendered home less and destitnto by the fires.
