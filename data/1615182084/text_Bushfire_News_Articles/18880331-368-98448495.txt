GUNDAROO. (From our Correspondent.) THERE is SO little stirring now, that I can hardly dish up anything for the " Post." Since the races a sort of reaction has set, in, and we are very quiet now. We want rain very badly; we have bhid a few, thunder-storms since my last, but they have passed with thunder and lightning, for we have had no rain to speak of-not sufficient to put out, the bush fires. Mr. Affleck informs me that we have only had Is points of rain since the 25th Febiruary. On Sunday last ainother bush'fire broke out on the common, but through the assistance of mainy willing hands, although. the wind was blowing very stongat the time, it was got within bounds before much damage was done. - The trustees of ; our common,. have now made a new :'rtile I;iwith regard to the payment of fees. The rule used to be that the commoners got ten or twelve days' grace to pay their fees at the beginning of the quarter; but owineg to some taking advantage of this ten or twelve days' grazing and then removing the stock and not paying for them at all, the herds man has been instructed to inform all commoners that all stock not paid for on Saturday, 3Irst inst., and found on the common on Monday, the 2nd prox., will be impounded without respect to persons, so that those interested had better look out. The lessee of the racecourse paddock has now paid his money and got possession. The electoral roll is.now open for in spection of .tthose interested at the court house. It would be well for all to see that their nanies are on it, and not be disap pointed when an election comes on by finding their names not on it whenrhey go to vote. The pigeon match has been postponed, I bear, so.-that there will be no sports of any kind here on Monday next, unless when the day arrives something impromptu is got up then.
