FATAL ACCIDENT, A melancholy and fatal accident happened last week to Mr THOMAS BAILEY a resident at Beverley, one of the early settlers in this colony. This gentleman who has recently been in Perth, and had altogether been absent from his own farm some three or four weeks, was on his road home one day at the latter end of' last week in a gig, accompanied by his son, who was on horseback. They were between York and Mr Bailey's residence when a bush-fire was observed to be raging in the neighbourhood and Mr Bailey directed his son to get on forward to ascertain that his premises were not being injured by the fire. Previous to his son leaving him, Mr Bailey had partaken of some water with a small portion of brandy, and appeared well, only complaining of inconvenience from the extreme heat of the day. On Mr Bailey, junior reaching his father's residence, he found that flames had not reached it, and after the lapse of a little time a man was despatched along the road to meet his father; Mr Bailey, however, not making his appearance, his son became anxious for his safety, and went himself to look for him. About five miles from the house he found the cart upset and Mr Bailey, sen., was lying in the road and in such a position as to leave no doubt that life was quite extinct. The cart appears to have been up set in a gulley alongside the road, and the driver probably thrown out in such a manner as to come in contact with the horse's legs for the head and body of the deceased had received sufficiently violent bruises or kicks to produce his death. A magisterial investigation was held into the circumstances of the accident before tho Assistant Police Magistrate, Mr Cowan, and as many respectable house- holders as could be collected on the spot. when the medical officer of the district examined the body and declarled that death had been caused the injuries in- flicted by the horse. A verdict to that effect was accorded.
