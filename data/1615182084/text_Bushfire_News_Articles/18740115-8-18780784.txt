COLONIAL MAEKETS. Domo STOCK RFPORT.-Januar) 8. Since the date of our last report, the weather has continued uncomfortably warm, and people are now beginning to shake their heads ominously at the uninterrupted signs of drought which are making their appearance. The very hot sun we have had recently has almost neutralised all the good of the rain of Christmas day. The ) oung grass has been parched and burnt up, and there is nothing left but the hard dr) grass, and that is onl) obtainable out back. Of course, these re- marks are onl) intended to apply to the country around Dubbo Sheep and cattle withal continue to look v ery fairly, though there is no question of it if this scotching weather continues, we shall soon, we are sorry to think, have a different tale to tell. Water is also fast exhausting, but we are in hopes of au occasional thunderstorm appearing to replenish dams and water-boles We bave had some dis- appointments regarding rain On Monday night, the clouds gathered as black as ink overhead, and a storm appeared imminent. A high gusty wind, how- ey er, soon dispelled the hopes of rain. On Tuesday evening, we had loud thunder, vivid lightning, and just enough rain to swear by. It is thought by the weather wise that a change is imminent. We hope so, for in all conscience we have had as much uninterrupted dry scorching weather as we want at present. AVe are glad to per- ceive that improvements are going on in all quarters. The dem ind for fencers is mcreismg, and owing to the want of labour, we hear of any amount of wire lying idle at some stations The desire to go in for improving herds is BIBO pretty general. Our stockowners are speculating m the best blood obtainable in the colonies ; and it is plain from the rapid strides which are being made that the di) s of the wretched three cornered rubbish-nn e) esore to every true lover of pedigree stock-are at an end. On the Macquarie frontages, grass and water are plentiful, but out back the suppl) is fast giving way, and unless we have a change before long, all stock will have to be removed to the frontages. Bush fires are troublesome m some places, and we hear of much damage being done. It is high time squitters, for their own protection, put .nto operation the provi- sions of the Careless Use of Fire Act. On the Bogan, matters are, as a iule, looking remarkably well. Though water out back is nuhei scarce, still it is plentiful on the frontage«, and feed on both is «bun dant enough for all purposes On the Lower Mao quane or Mole countrv, stock of all descnptions are in Al condition, and the drafts of fat cattle lifted from there rec»ntlv aie spoken of very highly On the Barwon, though bush fires have been more pre- valent than pleasant, grass and water are plentiful Stock are in fine condition Prom the Castleieagh, we have the best accounts The weather at T >rbes is unchanged Everything is reported tobe dr\ and bare \t Wagga Wagga bush fires have been recently prevalent in the distnct, to which the heat we have Iatelv experienced has contributed largeh The feed on all sides is dried up The most recent of the fires is one at Ah Jenkin»' Buckingbong station, where it is still raging Sime five miles of fencing have been already destroy ed At Berimbula fires also occurred, but with Bmall d image The unwonted visitation of Christmas hailstorm was this y ear experienced and upon the same dov some moderate showers of rain also fell, which teoiporaiily cooled the atmosphere, the heat previously being most intense The mar- kets are firm At Avagga, business has naturally been dull in consequence of the holidays Fat cattle are enquired for at good rates, vi7 , to ¿8 for bullocks, ¿7 for cows The diy weather lins caused the de- mand for stores to slacken 1 at sheep are not men- tioned, and the enquiries fo store sheep are but slight Mr G A Elliott (P,R, and Co ) reports having sold 100 fat bullocks for Mr W O A\mdeyer, G7 store cattle for Mr M Innis, and 87 head foi Air II Davis to Alessrs Devlin and Sons.
