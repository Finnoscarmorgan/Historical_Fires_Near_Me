THE RECENT BUSHFIRES. The Director of Education has received information that the Lower Longley school is not burnt down. Mr Rule says there is an old building further down the road which was formerly used as a school five years ago. He does not know whether this was burnt down or not. Mr Rule has had no news from the Mountain River, where the fire was raging. The Gordon school is burnt down. This school stands back in the bush. It was intended to reopen it after the holidays in the Courthouse, which suitable for the purpose. The Premier proceeded to the Sandfly this afternoon to view the damage done, and will take immediate steps to get the burnt school re-erected, and public tenders are called for the end of the week for its re-erection. In connection with the Carnarvon School the Director of Education informs us that this was rented from the trustees of Ferguson's estate. It was originally a cottage and occupied by the officers of the Convict Department. It is not a departmental school. There is not sufficient reason for building a State school there, but if no premises are available the school may be reopened as a private one.
