TILEH DROUGHT IN RIVERINA. The Pastoral Times of Jan. 30 says : -We have rot anything encouraging to write respecting stock matters. The weather is still dry and hot, and there "is every appearance of its continuing so. From all quarters save one we hear "of the want of water more than the want of feed for stock. The exception to which we refer is to be found in Peak Downs district, where heavy rains kept up the grass and herbage, and the country looked well when we last heard from that quarter. From Cooper's Creek to the Darling, and all along that river from the Upper Barwin down to Wentworth, thus early in this dry season stock of every description is suffering more or less. Wells are again had recourse to, and fortunate itis that our subterraneous water supplies deep in the bowels of the earth do not fail, as just now the losses in cattle, sheep and horses would be enormous. Large quantities of sheep and cattle are tra velling for grass, among these are about 14,000 sheep in Dubbo district, from whence considerable quantities of fat cattle are travelling to Sydney or Bathurst. Stock matters look gloomy on the Macquarie, and though there is not general despondency, stockowners are getting very uneasy as to their immediate future. All the stock now travelling in the Hay district are look ing for feed and water, and appear to suffdr greatly from the want of the latter. We hear of extensive bushfires on the Darling, and learn that a large proportion of Mr James Tyson's cattle, going up the river, are dead or dying froni the intense heat and long journeys without water. The weather at Hay has been hot and dry, with dust storms. No crossings to report. The weather is still hot and dry at Deniliquin, and our views of the future are not cheerful when we notice the great increase in the quantity of sheep in one district, viz., nearly half a million. The Edward River is: only, a chain of waterholos, crossable almost everywhere.
