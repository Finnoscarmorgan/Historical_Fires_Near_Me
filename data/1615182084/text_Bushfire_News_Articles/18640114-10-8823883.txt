THE ENGLISH MAIL. The Melbourne yfrmis of Saturday last contained tho fallowing :-" The English mail is now overdue, and news may be expected, vid South Australia, at any moment. On reference to our filo of January, 18G3, wo find that tho Madras, which brings the mail on this occasion, was four days after her time in reaching Molbourno in that month, a very heavy head gnle having been experienced, lasting for six suece3bive days, in tho Indian Ocean. It will also bo remembered that when the Madras entered Port Phillip Bay tho weather was so stormy, and tho smoko of many bush-fires made navigation so difficult, that the Madras brought up off Brighton, but was forced soou afterwards to slip her cable in a squill." Supposing tho Madras not yet to have reached Melbourne, sho is again four days overdue, her time for arrival at that port beiug Sunday last. On enquiry at the Telegraph office at ten o'clock last evening, no word of her had been received.
