BLACK THURSDAY. (Reprinted from the Argus.) Probably one of the most terrible days of which there is any record in Aus- tralian annals was Thursday, the 6th of Feb. 1851, commonly known as Black Thursday. But a small proportion of our present colonists have any recollec- tion of that day, as our total population then only amounted to about 70,000 souls against 350,000 of to-day. But such of their number as have access to files of the newspapers published at the time, would do well to turn them over, and, as a warning for the future, glance at the narrative of the disasters of that dreadful day. We find it recorded lliat as early' ax 7 or 8' -o'clock '-ill- ilie morning the ther mome'er stood' al 117° in the shade. At ?' mid^day^it 'sank ' lo l()0o,'';bul in the aflern'oiln it rose, agnin, and at '4 o'click t»«i -at 1 13°. ?
