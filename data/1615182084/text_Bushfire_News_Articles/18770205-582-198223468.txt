As the morning mail . train of Saturday from Melbourne was passing between Woodend and Malmsbury, a youth delighting himself as- some colonials do, wilfully threw a stone and smashed the window of the Post-office carriage. Mr Jame3 Farroll, M.L.A., was in Castle maine on Saturday, and did some canvassing for the approaching election. His candidature, therefore, is assured. The only question now is who, will cause a contest, or will thore be a walk ! over! The " singing band" still continue thor Sab- . bath afternoon visits to the various wards in the Hospital, where they .receive a hearty welcome. The barren state to which the open country in! the neighbourhood of the town is reduced by the long drought, induces herds of goats to come, into the latter in search of feed. Those having! gardens will need to keep the gate closed, or the maurauders will, as they have already done in! several instances, strip their cultivated patches.! A cricket matoh is to be played on the Camp, reserve on Wednesday, the 2Iet inBt., (between' Hallas' Band, Sandhurst, and the Oastlemaine Volunteer Band.

On Friday last a party of Chinamen were working some old ground near the Duke and Duchess claim, Golden Gully, Fryers, when one of them, named Wo .Hung, . ventured too far under the overhanging mullock. ..This slipped,' and in its /-fall '.nearly burieu tne untortunate Chinaman:; ' His mates;set to work, soon extri- catodjhim, and then ,f,dpk; him to Iris hut ; Dr Mercer 'was sent for, - arid' on examination found that. the poor fellow's -back is severely injured, so much so that iu all probability he will not re cover.: At' the annual meeting of the' representatives of the various lodge's of the G.U.O.O.F., held last week, Mr Peter Ferrie, of Campbell's Greek; who has for the last fourteen years occupied the position of treasurer, was proposed to be re appointed. That gentleinan, however, declined to be nominated, as he thought the honour might bo conferred on some other brother younger in the Order, and as, moreover, he was about to leave the district. A cordial vote of thanks was accorded to him for his past services, and a sum of money voted to purchase a suitable souvenir, to be presented to him at the next quarterly meeting. Some two years ago a Chinaman was suddenly missed from Barker's Creek, and as he left his tent arid contents behind him, the .circumstance caused surprise to his country then, who made every inquiry for him, but were unable to trace him. When he left his tent to go to work on the morning of the day he waB last seen, he pur- chased some usn tor ms evening meal on nis return, and it was in the tent when search !was first made for him. Information was recently given to the police that a European had, in a quarrel with him, struck him a fatal blow with a pick, and covered him up. The police very properly took the necessary steps to ascertain the truth of the rumour ; but although the spot indicated was opened the body waB not found, neither haB any clue to the !missing man being discovered. x A very destructive fire occurred on Friday afternoon on Macedon house farm, Rochford. Mr Onions had only just commenced threshinjg when a spark from the engine flew on one of the stacks, immediately salting three of them ori: fire, and bumiug them to the ground. It-was with great difficulty that Mr YinnecombeY threshing machine was saved. Mr Onion's loss will be great, although by the very active assistance of the neighbours and their men three other stacks, with outbuildings, were eaved. At the time the fire happened, the wind, which was very strong, was veering round, arid blowing from nearly all "points. ; An accident of a singular nature happened at Hobart Town on the 25th ult., to two men named Terry and Haigh, who were boiling Borne, tar for road-making in a kerosene tin. The tar caught bre, wnen Terry covered tne tin ;up with a board, and the result !was that, it exploded, arid the boiling tar was scattered over both men. Haigh was severely burnt about the. handa arid face, while Terry, whose' clothes caught fire, was burnt about the arms and bead, and both legs- from his thighs downward. .He stated that had it riot been for a lady who was passing, he would have lost his life. This lady, with great pre sence of mind, rolled him on the ground until the flames were extinguished. , i A fatal accident occurred at Geelong ou Fri day to n young man named Henry, son ofja farmer on the Barrabo.ol Hills.

Thirty-oiglit, or 47-A per cent., cf the total deaths were of children- not exceeding the ago of three years, 31 being under the age of one year. The Ballarat Star of Friday- makes a most startling statement. It informs its readers that " there is now, in all tho dams, only sufficient water to supply tho town for from fifteen to twenty days at most. Judging by present ap-i pearanee," continues our contemporary, there ; is not the least ohanco: of any - useful' rain for some time, so that it is evident we have reached , a crisis in regard to the water supply." Two packers (brothers) left Cooktown' iri the; end of November. A man named Rogers foundi the remains of several horses cut to pieces and a. quantity of rations and several pocket books,! with the name of Macquarie, about a quarter of! a mile from Byerstown.

The whole of the crop, 200 bushels of haud- threshed wheat, the home stead and outhouses, drays,, and.. .implements wero destroyed. Murray, who is a struggling man, and has a large family, has .just returned! from Melbourne, where he was operated 011 for: cancer 011 tho tongue. He became -so excited that he jumped into the firo, and was with diffi- culty rescued. He is now ruined, one small hut only remaining to shelter his' family. The origin of tho fire is inexplicable. Tho meu at'1 the threshing- machine next to this farm ..started' a subscription to relievo tho distressed family,: the neighbours. assisting. Some experiments, states the Age, were made in the Melbourne Gaol on Friday by;Dr M'Crea and Mr Girdlestone, 'in tho "presence of several other gentlemen, with the object of testing the efficacy of anew remedy for poison by snakebite,! introduced to the notice ot the Government by; Mr James, Hurst, who has recently, arrived from Queensland. The specific is a secret, and is stated by its discoverer to liave'be'en successfully employed by him on dogs, rabbits and other animals with, perfect . success in many cases: On Friday six dogs were treated after., having! had half a grain of tiger-snake poison injected intravenously. - The experiment commenced about two o'clock, and at half-past ten, all the dogs having .been treated, three of them were alive, two "doing well, having taken food since: The antidote was applied in a aoraewhat different manner to that in which Mr Hurst has been aci customed to use it, which may account for the death of the first three experimented upon ; but he is sanguine that further exDeriments ' will demoustrate the value of his specific satisfac torily. One of the surviving dogB suffered very greatly from the effects of the poison prior to the antidote being admipistered. A correspondent sent the Argus a small bottlri half -filled with water, and having at the bottom a long, thread-like worm wriggling itself inces santly into innumerable contortions. Our cor respondent explains this curious creature's pre'r sence in the water as follows : â€” " I.have to en close for your especial gaze a very odd subject:. The ;Worm, or: whatever it is, came through -the. ordinary Yan Yean tap in Collins-street this fore noon. I proceeded at once to experimentalise upon it. I found the worm lively and, quitb frisky, wriggling into coils and out again, its Bmallest coil 'being easily admissible for swallow ing,' say half the size of. a little finger nail. I then placed the worm in whisky, wondering how long it.inight.live. For 23 minutes it wriggled about iri doses of strong whisky, and fin- 25 minutes it ; apparantly, died after uncoiling.
