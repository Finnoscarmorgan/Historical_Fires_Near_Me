COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The A rant Office, Monday B venfn %. Tho business transacted in the import rnsrkit to-doy has been elight, and no im provt ment is anticipated until the arrivai of themail. In breadstuff*, it is still impas- sible to furnish quotations of any value, as buyer, and holden appear alike diffident of operating. The sales of general merchandise huvo been of trifling extent. Fifty chests of fine congou tea have chnnged bands at Is. lUd. in bond. In sugars, there has bien little doing, but' a Bmall parcel of counters has been quitted at £37 53., duty paid. The spiiit market is devoid of animation. 500 . cases of geneva, of an outside brand, have been disposed of at a fair rate, but beyond this we have heard of no transactions. A prospectus of a new company, to be teimed the "M'lvor Hydraulic Sluicing and Gold-mining Company," appears in our adver- tising columns. The capital is to be £10,000, in 1,000 shares of £10 each-£1 por share to le paid on application, and £2 per share on allotment. The object of the enterprise is to conieive the head waters of tho creeks in the reighbourhocd, and convey them, by means of a race, through the auriferous country lying between Tooboorac and Heathcote, at an elevation sufficient to command the whole gold field district of M'lvor. A report from lecal engineers is annexed to the prospectus, icfertlng in terms of approbation to the seht me. * Export entries were passed at the Customs to-day for 20c z. 15dwt. of gold, of which quantity 6ez. lOdwt. were shipped per Hero ftrDunedin, and 14.o~.5dwt. per Great Britain for Liveipoiil.

Deniliquin Stock Bei-ort.-AVo have but gloomy accounts to wrlto of present prospects. There is plenty of feed away from the frontages ; but many reservoirs that wcro expected to hold out tho summer havo dried up, and there is no resource left but to bring stock in. This is not surprising, considering wo havo had but one Inch of rain for nearly five months. On the Murray, and other favourlto routes, travelling stock have o hard time of it ; how par- ties In charge land their mobs in anything like condition is surprising; but station-holders having tbclr frontages thus cut off aro in a bad state. On jartB of tho Lachlan and other rivers the same remarks apply, and If rain docs not come shortly we moy expect to hear of serious losses, Wo bear or no transactions In tho neighbourhood, and there ore but few reported at AVagga Wogga, whore 'lately there has beon much activity. Tho river being very low, and fordablo almost anywhere, we aro unable to accurately roport all stock pissing down, but wo believe that rather above tho overage is on the road. Tho Mclbourno markothas for some time been too healthy to permit anyone who could muster a mob to refrain from sending. Tho following havo'crossed hore: -On the 7th-100 fat cattle, ,M. Patterson's; on tho 10th-170 fat cattle, Denwood's ; and two other mobs early in the week. The weathor looked vory stormy this after- noon, but it has slnco blown off.

Webb, the engineer in charge of the, Persian Gulf submarine telegraph, has given some particulars of the state of the cable, which had in many places to be taken up and repaired. In some parts thero was complete separation, evidently eaused by the cable chafing on the rocks, and in others, the outer serving had been removed in many places. 'In one place for a milo and a quarter the serving had entirely disappeared, although , there were no signBlof heavy chafing on the iron. The galvanizing had entirely disap- peared also. In this particular case, the re moral of the serving, Mr. Webb thinks, has been the result either of the Bea actually washing it off, or it has been the work of some destructive insect. In the same cor- respondence, we are told that the tribes through whose territories the land line was being constructed towards Bagdad, bad offered no opposition to the work.-TA« Friend 0/ India, , ,
