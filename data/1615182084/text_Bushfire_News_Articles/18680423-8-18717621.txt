WALLABADAH. THE PUBLIC SCHOOL.-very great complaint is being made by the inhabitants of Wallabadah, and we think not without good cause, at the state their school- house is in. A teacher has been there six months, and 34 children are on the roll, and yet the local board, or those whose duty it is to look after this matter, have not yet sent a single stool, chair, form, table, or desk. The consequence is, the children sit on the floor. Of course they cannot learn to write. The Council months ago offered to pay two-thirds of the money required for the furniture, if the local board found the rest. The parents of the children are willing to find the money, but the local board it seems will not accept the offer of the Council. Thus the children have to suffer from neglect on the part of some persons. However, it is disgraceful that the matter is left in abeyance. Something must be done, or the inhabitants will at once send a memorial to the Governor upon the subject. PETTY SESSION'S AT WALLABADAH -We see a sum of money has been voted for a C.P.S. at Wallabadah. This appears a strange proceeding, and a wanton waste of the public money. BUSH-FIRE.-A person named Dogherty had his house and contents all burned by a bush-fire at Borambil Creek. April l8.
