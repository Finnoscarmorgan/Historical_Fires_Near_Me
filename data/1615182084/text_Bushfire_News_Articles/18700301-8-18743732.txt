Respecting the report of a vessel being on fire off Cape Otway, the following information has been received from the Underwriters' Associa- tion, "Melbourne :-" In reference to the ship on fire reported last night (22nd instant), the Cap- tain of the Tower Hill says be only saw a reflec- tion in the sky as of a fire. He thought at first it was a bush fire on King's Island ; but calcu- lating the position, he saw that this would be impossible.. It must have beena ship. The captain of the Ann says that he distinctly saw at 8 o'clock on Monday night, a large blaze like a burning ship. He was then close to Moonlight Head The burning ship was apparently dis- tant about fourteen miles S. by E. Both captains agree about the position and the time of the fire. The wind did not favour an approach to the burning ship. The captain of the ship Orwell, just arrived, says that he was in the same position as described by the captains of the vessels, in 'Warrnambool, at the same time, and he aays that it was a large bush-fire on King's Island."

The Herald says of the weather in Sydney : At nine o'clock on Saturday morning, the storm signals were hoisted at Fort Philip, cautioning ships that a strong southerly gale was blowing on the coast. The Government steamer at once got up steam, and during the forenoon proceeded to the Heads, to be in readiness should any vessel heave in eight. The gale continued to increase during the day, and on that night blew very heavy, in violent rain squalls. There wa, no indication of any change until yesterday evening, when it lulled considerably; and as the night advanced the weather showed signs of having broken; a very high sea was running on the coast. At midnight, however, the weather again thickened, and heavy squalls of rain passed over the city The barometer, which during the day had risen to 30, fell 2-10ths ; and the wind, which had veered to S.W., shifted back to S.-an indication that the force of the gale had not been exhausted. It is remarked that simultaneously with the movement in Sydney in the matter, attention has been called iu Victoria to light sentences, and to the inadequacy in some instances between the punishment imposed and the heinousness of the crime.
