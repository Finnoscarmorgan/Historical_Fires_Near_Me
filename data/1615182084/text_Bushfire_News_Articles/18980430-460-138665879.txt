At the risk of repetition^ therefore, I must again impress upondairy farmers the abso lute necessity of giving close attention to the proVidifur of a regular supply of arti ficial.fodder for itheir cowb both for summer and winter |ise.

The officer I of the local council in the Wmote'" wildis'of j .Wales, who poises its such'kh authority on I (.he use of bor&eie; beid, considers that -not more than 0.5lb. (i.e., 8oz.), should be added to every 1121b. of butter. Perhaps he is not a ware that very few Victorian factory managers ever use more than this quantity. If a law therefore should be passed iri Eng land fixing 8oz. ad thfeiriaxitaum quantity of boracic .acid p^hi^.tid per] huriftrea-i weight of butter, we frill "not have pny'diffi culty in complying with .that law. If pas teurising' becomes general,.'there "will- tben be no need for using brtraeic acid at all in, butter intended for local consumption. J'ASTEUBISING MILK^ND CBEAM FOB BUTTER . MAKING. In any report oflaBt year I.mentioned that tlie same necessity for pasteurising milk and' rream does not exist in Victoria as in Euro pean countries, where the milch "do'ws are, closed un for six months of the year in close, stuffy, ill-ventilated byres, and fed on highly concentrated foods. I hold thatopinion still. Nevertheless, as, from causes some times difficult to trace, the butter made ati several of Dur factories is deteriorajjng in I flavour, I say unhesitatingly that the' quickest and cheapest remedy lies in pas- j teurising the cream. In order to ascertain if i better prices could be obtained in London for pasteurised butter than for a good quality of butter made by the ordinary niclhod, I induced four of our large fac-1 tories to each pateurise parcels for export' so as to compare results. The prices ob tained in England for the pasteurised butter j have not as yet shown any appreciable dif-1 fere nee on the -prices obtained for best' butter made in the usual way, and sent from the same factories and by the samej boat. As already stated, however, where the conditions prevent the manufacture of i a bigli-class quality of butter, I would strongly recommend managers, thus1 situated, adopting the pasteurising system. DAItt Y. EDUCATION. Dairy -education,' not only for batter-1 makers, but also for doiry'farmers, is greatly' needed. The butter-makers' wpuld be enormously benefited by a uniform, scienti fic training in the treatment of milk, cream, and butter, and a training of_this kind can only be imparted by an instructor scienced in analytical cltemistry, and combining with this several years' close practical experience m the study and : treatment of milk and cream. Equally necessary, is. it that, some' means be introduced of distributing infor mation amongst dairy farmers that would tend to improve the present system of breeding cows for dairy purposes, and also for feeding corns with the view to obtaining the highest possible butter results. A cen tral dairy school is what- would eventually I enable us to turn out the most scientific nutter and cheese makers, but in the mean- j time I would recommend that one large and well-equipped factory be selected in, say four of our largest dairying districts,! and that e&oh; factory be rented by the! department of Agriculture for 3?hort sueees- j Mve terms. At these training factories thei managers of factories; in the surrounding j localities would willingly attend for' the term. Here the scientific information which j they are all so eagerly trying to obtain could lie imparted, and each training factory get us own turn during the year. Uniformity in the quality of our regular weekly consign ment of butter during the export season would enhance its value from 10 to 20 per! cent. Scientific dairy education,-either at i district training factories or at a dairy i school, is the only means whereby this uui-j lormity can be brought about. 1 TESTING MILK fob bctter factobies. During the past season there have been numerous disputes between suppliers of: milk to lactone* ind the factory managers regarding the reliability of the JBabcoek tester. The Babcocktester, propprly mani pulated, cannot jerr. Yet suppliers in several' instances are pot .satisfied with the.butteri tat result* furnished by ihe jnanagcts, and con6iderab}e_diseatisfactjy9n. hasbeeu the outcome.

CONCLUSION. When we come to consider the trying, effects of three dry seasons ip succession,: and disastrous bush-fires during the Summer i'ust terminated, it is a matter for cohgratu ation that. under the circumstances, the: dairying industry has passed through this severe ordeal as successfully as it has done.. This goes to pros'e that even under the most adverse conditions dairying is an in dustry that can be relied upon. What, other industry in such seasons as we haye been experiencing - can, after providing for home requirements, show an exported eur-j plus of close upon three-quarters of a mil-: lion sterling in value? . The'pofisibiliti&s;' of the dairying industry of Victoria must 'not' be Judged bv looking atthings When- .at theirworat.-The fUture of the* dairying in-: dUstry is perfectly Bound/ A succesaiop of favourable seasons is now due to us, and when the: tide once turns the prospects"^ for all rurdl industries will rapidly Brighten.' .Victoria's powers of recovery, 'when the* conditions are favourable, are dimply mar vellous. Then,-too, expensive but valuable lessons have been taught dairy farmers by the drought. Providingfodderfor dairy herds will receive greater attention in the future. [So, too, will the improving of the butter I producing capacity of dairy cows, so as to | | raise the average standard butter yield per j cow per annum. Given, too, that the .Go vernment continues its efforts in the direc tion of dairy education, and thereby brings about an improved quality and a maximum ! unifornjjty of the butter we export, the! average value per hundredweight will be j substantially increased. Altogether, the ; outlook for the future is far from being a J ! gloomy one. With an improved system of breeding, better selections of high-class butter cows when breeding for dairy pur poses, a scientific training of our butter makers at, suitable, training factories, and all these backed np with normal seasons, the r extent of our exports of dairy produce to the various markets of the world will yet reach several millions sterling in v$lue per annum.
