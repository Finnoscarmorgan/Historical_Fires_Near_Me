DESTRUCTIVE BUSH FIRES. (FROM THE BENDIGO ADV1.IIT1SER, TEB 1 ) In our yesterday's issue we stated that it was rumoured that tnc disastrous fire which commenced on Wednesday had been caused by some of the Government employes on the railway line attempting to burn up some long grass and rubbish. We are now assured that such was the case, and that three of the Huflerers have already taken steps towards recovering compensation from the Govern- ment for the loss they li ive sustained. It seems on 'lncsday some of tho men emplo}cd near the 14-mile railway crossing had been cutting the long grass and rubbiBh, and that as it was all very dry, the ganger, Robert Eadie, decided to burn it up the next diy (Wcdnesdu}) He issued his orders to that «effect, and very soon found that the lire spread with BUCII rapidity as to endanger property. Every exertion waa then put lorth to stay the progresa of the llames, which lind passed the railwny fence and caught the grass on 3Ir. Moffatt s run E idle himself set a good example to his men in tr> ing to stay the progress of the flames, but unfortunate)) the hot w eather overcame him, and he died in them inner previously related. A number of the railway men were sent up to Ravenswood to assist in putting out the fire, but the flames had obtained a good hold of the di) grass and treeB, and all efforta to check its progress vv ere futile, and the fire, which commenced about noon on Wcdiicsdav, was rngir.g fiercely last night, although not so bad as on V cdnesday, and going in the direction of Preston Vale On 3Ir Jfoffatt's run nbout 2,000 acres of gri38 and some unies of fencing were destrojed, m what is known as the Ravenswooil-paddock, the favourite place of resort for picnic parties. Thence it spread into Mr P Seeber'sandMr. Kolles paddocks, destro)ing agun miles of tenets, thousands of tons ol valuable timber and firewood, and 3tr. Seeber's garden, and then sweeping along in a westerly direction it followed the Bighill range for about two miles further, when the wind changing drove it again into 3Ir. 3Ioffatt's paddock The violence of the fire, sweeping through the long crass of Mr Kolles and Mr. Seeber's paddock was such that the noise of the ap- proaching flames, resembling distant thun- der, could be heard at least a quarter of a mile in advance The tops of mau) ot the tallest trees are scorched und burnt, and a number of trees are burning still on tlie country ov cr w Inch the lire li is swept About 10 men were emplo)ed on Mr. 3Ioiiatt's run with onl) mdillercnt success, and about 20 of 3Ir Kolle's neighbours succeeded only by tlie most dogged perseverance and hard labour in saving that gentlemen's resi- dence and stopped the lire before it readied the Coliban \\\ aterw orks fence Had it once got into the long grass of that enclosure no human exertion could possibl) have saved the v.\ aterw orks fence, and it vv ould be impossi- ble to say where the fire would then have ter- minated Some idea of the difficulties en- countered bj those who were trying to check the spread of the llames ma) bo gained when we state that in several instances immense volumes of gaseous Haines were fnirly carried through the aira distance of over ÖOjards, igniting the grass and starting the fire in almost even direction At other times burn- ing leaves from the trees were carried over the heads of those who had started fires to meet the one approaching, with the view of making a clearing and BO cutting oil its further progress, and the grnss being set alight, the labour per- haps of hours was lost in a moment, and the workers near]} surrounded by flames Owing, however, to the stillness of the day on Tliurs- da) , the lire did not make such rapid head waj, but, fanned with the wind of )eatcrday, and particularly after Bundown, the flames commenced again to Bpread rapidly, and as far as could be seen by the naked e)e the bush was on fire, and trees burning, m man) enses 50ft from the ground No idea of the actual amount of damage done can )et be estimated, but we understand that Messrs Moflatt Sceber, and Kolle have commenced proceedings with a view of obtlining from the Government compensation for the heav) losses Bustained 3Ir. Moffatt is, of course, the pimcipal Bufleier.

The grass was discovered to be on fire in the vicinity of the Slatey Creek on Tuesday last, and before any effectual mea sures could be taken to suppress the out break, it spread over the whole side of the country and up to the Black Forest, where, the timber being light and dry, and the weather being nearly hot enough to light a fire without the aid of matches, almost everything was consumed, and several of the farmers had as much as they could do to save their houses, especially Messrs. Cross and Connelly, on the Slately Creek. The scene of the fire, which was only about two miles south of Woodend, presented quite a brilliant appearance at night time, the tongues of flame being visible for miles distant as they crept stealthily up from the grass into the trees, wrapping them in flame, and extending from branch to branch and tree to tree with lightning rapidity, lighting up the whole dull forest with a magnificent illumination. The fires burnt with great destruction to property till Thursday when they went out, the change in the atmosphere and the measures taken by the farmers having proved more than enough for the enemy. We have not yet; ascertained the origin of the fire nor the amount of damage done in the country over which it has passed.
