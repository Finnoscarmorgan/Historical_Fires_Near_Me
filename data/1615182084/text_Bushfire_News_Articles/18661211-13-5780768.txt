GOMMERGLAL INTßLLlQENCE. The Ârsut Office, Monday Evoning. In the import markets business foi the week has opened oat with almost a total want of animation. Early in the morning a report was outrent that the mall steamer's arrival at Adelaide had boon telegraphed, but though this was shortly afterwards found to be incorrect, its influence waa felt in the markets throughout the day. In broadetuffa there ia an cntiro absence of any desire to do bualnoBP, and, as a consequonce, eales even for trade purposes are of the moat trifling description. Holders of Adelaide flour (town brands), however, still retain their quotation of £13 to £13 103,, while £12 to £12 10s. is wanted for country brands. There are no sales to report of wheat. The cargo of the , Woodlands, from California,, consisting of ] wheat, barley, and oats, ia to be offered to- morrow by auction, and as the importers mean Belling the position of the market will be fairly tested. We hear of a voiy brisk in- quiry for new barley, but at the price offered no sellers could be met with. In one instance we learn of 8a, ]Jd. having been accepted for some 6,000 bushels, a portion of the Anglo Saxon's shipment ; but the same figure was refused for nearly the entire shipment, as the importera have resolved to hold the balance for an advance on the price named. Currants are much wanted, and sales of uno samples at 4d., though not large, have boon numerous. Transactions in Dundee cornsaoks to a mode- rate extent are reported at 13a. Gd. Oilmen's stores continue to be moved off in fair quan- tities at full rates. A shipment of Joyce's pickles was dlsposod of at Gs. Gd. A good demand is maintained for provisions. Some fifty casos of Sinclair's hams and bacon were placed at about equal to late quotations, 13}d., duty paid. At auction, the cargo of teas per Tell was offered, and 781 packages found buyers at about current rates, Is, 5}d. having been accepted for good common congou, and 28\. for orange pekoes of long leaf. At a conces- sion on importers'limits, the greater portion of the cargo might have been cleared off. In tobaccoes, a parcel of l63 half and quarter tierces faulty twists was disposod of at prices ranging from 2Jd. to 9d. Havannah cigars realised £910s. por 1,000. Malt is inactive, Bales being limited to the purchases of the trade, and 10a. 9d. has been reallsod to-day. American rosin has been placed at £20. Amongst the arrivals will bo found the Royal Standard from Liverpool, the Spray of the Ocean from China, and the Nil Desperandum from Mauritius. Thero were no export entries for gold passed at the Customs to-day. The following auctioneers' reports have been received : Messrs. Fraser and Co. otTorod at their rooms the cargo of the Toll, from Foo- cliow, and succoodod In soiling 781 packages at full curreut rates. At a slight concession on limits, the greater portion of the cargo could have boon cleared, but importers would not nive way. Also, at tho Victorian Kail way » shod, 103 half and quarter tierces twist tobacco, all fiults, at from 2J_ to Öd. por lb. ; also, Havannah cigars, £9 10s. per 1,000. MoBsra. S. II.

DBNIMQUIN.-The weather continues fine and dry, and the thermometer has not as yet approached Its maximum of summer heat. Our settlers are beoomlng anxiously alive to the danger of bush-fires, and are taking all the procautions in tholr power to prevent their occurronco. The provisions of the new act aro exceedingly stringent against those who leave camp fires burning. A great doal in the way of mitigating the effects of bush-fires might be done by burning tho grass off narrow strips of land, which would act as a chock to the progress of the devour- ing element. This season thoro l8 a more than usual need of care, on account of the large growth of horbngo, which forms abundant fuel to the fiamos. What a change has come over tho district. A few months ago, and tho f ew so-callod "fat" cattle woro as destitute of fat as a 'possum, so that that good old article of English diet, plum-pudding, was banished our tables for want of suet. Now, sheep and entilo aro " rolling fat," and coming forward In groat abun- dance. Can nothing be done to equalise these alter- nations of over plenty and famino scarcity? Host certainly; and, indeed, much is being dono by Bottlers, as may be soon hy tbo accounts appearing, from time to time, in our Kiverine intelligence-sink- ing wells, cutting canals to natural reservoirs, &a.;~ which will enable stock to be fattened In dry seasons. The great equaliser, however, must bo looked for In some such Bystem as that of Professor Morgan boing brought Into general use by moneyed men, killing and curing whon Btock is over-plentiful, and soiling whon prices »re high because of scarcity.
