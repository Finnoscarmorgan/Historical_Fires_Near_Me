[?] [?] \~py*'ilfAcm.rJ' : One reads mach. nowadays of the prbgiessjof colonisation. One hears much, of the rapid, rise of -a|amniu.ties, of tbe quick changes of modern life *and /the sndden surprises of ? eontemporary . history. It is rare,'liowever, that one is prrmegea to B©e for oneself, the startling contrasts and pregnant transf ormations/svMch iiave been effected doling twenty years of iirostling activity and. onward progress, in a yoting country like 35ew . Zealand.- To endeavor to describe something of these is jny aim in these notes of travel. It is now more than 20 years since I first landed on the shingly beach at Port Lyttelton, in the Canterbury province,. and -with light pockets and hopeful -heart trudged, over the high nfil that then barredthecityofChristchnrchfromitsport. The great tunnel (monument to the foresight and energy of Mr. Moorhonse, who at that time 'was superintendent of the province), was then only in course of perforation. In the whole of the New Zealand grxJup, only some nine miles of railways were in working order. It was my fate to travel pretty extensively through the inlandR then. I ?visited nearly all the towns of any note, and being young, impressionable, and not unobservant, ?those early scenes are indelibly fixed in my memory. .; 'When I left India some years ago, my intention was to revisit New Zealand, and compare its pre sent appearance with my recollections of its former state ; but liitherto circumstances had prevented my carrying out that intention, until a few months ago,I found the opportunity Iliad so fondly desired, and these siotes ot travel are cneresnw; 01 my recent wanderings in the scenes of 'my early experience, and I shall endeavor to make them as interesting and instructive as I can. The 'incidents of steamship travel are pretty tmiformniuwra-days. I could draw a graphic con trast between the old Mermaid, clipper ship, for ^instance, in which I made myfirst' voyage 1to the Antipodes, and the smart, well-found modern steamer Manapouri, one of the magnificent fleet of the UnionS. S. Co. of N.Z., with her genial, lovatile commander, Captain Logan ; but it may be Buffioifait to say, that after a few days' steam ing we sighted Cape Maria early on a Monday morn ing, and I once more gazed with strangely mingled feelings on 'ihe land of the Maori and the moa,' ?the new Great Britain of the Southern Seas. Cape Maria is the northernmost point of the mainland of the colony, but it is not the first land sighted by the voyager from Sydney to Auckland. The triple islets named 'The Three Kings ' lie to the north ofypape Maria, and are the first spot of the Maori domain that catches the eye oi the' man on the look out. Eastward of the cape is a wide, shallow bay known as Spirit Bay. The coastline terminates in an abrupt solitary conical bluff. -salled Spirit Point. The designation, however, relates not to that mundane medium of seduction which a Scotchman would call 'speeriis,' but oweB its name to a legendary belief of the waning Maori race. These dusky warriors hold, that the spirits of the departed here congregate and poise them selves on the dizzy verge, preparatory to taking their final leap from the shores of their earthly dwelling place. Prom this point they wing their flight to the Three Kings, which are thus the veritable Walhalla of the Maori Tace. A' sacri legious cynic aboard remarked, that if a private still, were only set. to work on the Three Kings, the spirits of a good many more than merely defunct Maories might be expected to muster thick when the roil was called. Behind Cape Maria stretches a weary, wild sand drift. We could see the clouds of shifting sand ?whirling aloft like a mist. The country does not, indeed, look inviting here. It is reputed to be the most barren tract in all Kew Zealand. Indeed, as the reader will findif he follows me, a suspicion sometimes steals across the mind of the observant traveller that, on the whole, perhaps the fertility of the country has been overrated. Farther inland a good breed of Herefords has been introduced.; and at2forth Cape, a few, miles to the eastward, many sheep can be .seen from the steamer browsing on the scanty pastures. ' The chief industry on this part of the island, is thie digging for kauri gum by thejnatives, and scattered parties of bnshmen. The diggers probe. inTthe likely, places for the buried deposits of the amber-like gum with long slender spears. In Auckland, great warehouses are filled with huge blocks of this unearthed treasure. It looks just Vim clouded amber, and a lively foreign trade is done with the steamer passengers in trinkets made from it. The Uorth Cape presents a rugged, scarred, ?weather-beaten front. It is capped by . a thin layer of red earth, and in the^precipitous|jgTillies, a jjatcliy -undergrowth of stunted bushes main tains a precarious foothold. In one ravine, the smoke from a bush-fire mils lazily up in murky columnss,^!! the gale, catching it as it emerges fromthe shelter of^the gnlly, whirls it abroad, amid the dashing spray and driving rain. Truly a wild, forbidding, tempestuous coast. And what awful tragedies have been enacted here in the grim past '. The Ted earth Iook3 ominous. It suggests bloodshed- I had -pictured something greener and fresher looking. This is not one whit less, sombre than the ordinary Australian coast— * * . - ?

But Auckland with its wider sweep, its greater diversity and bolder features^ has a beauty of its own which makes her a notrunworthy rival. . In other respects the city presents features which might well be copied by the great metropolis which clusters so thickly on the shores of Port Jackson. For 'instance, there is here a well-endowed harbor trust, which has a near prospective income of close on half a mQlion per annum, and an agita tion has even now been commenced in favor of TTin.lriTig the port free in the 'widest sense. Large reclamations have been and are being made ; spacious wharfs run out into deep .water. The reclaimed land is let on fifty years' leases. So valuable is it that the trustees pet .£10 per foot per fl.TiTiTrm for the first twenty-five years, and an enhancement upon that of fifty per cent, for the second twenty-five years. A hand some custom-house is now in ' course of erection. Public baths, well-ordered and cleanly iept, are extensively patronised close by. An enormous building is rapidly going up close- to the chief -wharf for a further extension of the meat-freezing industry. The eea line is faced with spacious warehouses and handsome coriimer cial buildings, and, chief est convenience pf all, the railway station is being built within, the harbor precincts, and the locomotive and +he steamer are within neighborly V»»i .of each other. Thus, there is no waste of time, of power, or of money, in ship ping and discharging operations. . _ By contrast -with the miserable makeshifts and primitive arrangements of Sydney, Auckland rises to the rank of a modern city, while Sydney, by the comparison, sinks to the level of a mediaeval fishing village, only she does not even have a decent supply of fish, -which Auckland has. No good is got by burking unpleasant truths. He is afalse prophet who only 'prophesies smooth tilings.' He is no true journalist or publicist who cries 'Peace, peace/' when there is no peace. All honor and good speed to the Harbour Im provement Board lately established in Sydney by private citizens. What has been done in Auck land could be almost infinitely outdone by Sydney with her greater wealth and wider commerce. A trust established in Sydney for the same pur poses as the one in Auckland, would in a few years be enormously wealthy, and the reputation of the port, and the public convenience would be a mii lionf old . enhanced. The vested interests ot a seJ f ishfew cannot for ever be allowed to bar the tray of national progress. Queen-street is the chief artery of this city. It runs up a natural valley somewhat after the manner of Pitt-street, only the street is much wider, and now that a Building: Act is in opera tion, very handsome structures are rising on every hand. Evidences of the old regime are yet apparent in very unsightly ramshackle verandahs here and there. I observe several necessary con veniences for pedestrians at modest intervals. Here again the Maori city scores a point against our own. Daring our visit a gum warehouse and bedding factory took fire. Such is the splendid nature of the water supply, and the efficiency of the fire brigades, that in less than 30min from the first clanging of the great bells the fire was extinct. Bell towers are a prominent feature in all S'ew Zealand towns., and where wooden houses are the rule, fires, of course, are very frequent. The magnificent jets of water paled into puny insignificance ^the dribbling gouts of -our inter mittent Sydney eapply, and in AucTdand the painful 'clank, clack' of the pumps is never heard when the fire fiend has to foe battled with. There are two capital; commodious theatres, ^fe went to hear Eemenyi. The Governor, and IMDayor, and councillors were there. Ostrich feathers seemed the leading feature in the head dresses of the ladies. Gigantic structures of the Queen Anne era were surmounted by a panoply of feathers that would have, turned a fashionable undertaker green withenvyai'These keptnodding time to the magic sweetness evoked by the gifted violinist; and the effect was, as if the theatre was the f orest 'of Yallambrosa in a gale. Herr Himmel sang a ballad. The deep Ger man gutturals rang through the building with an unmistakeable Teutonic twang. .A corpulent civic dignitary sitting behind us, turned to his beplumed dowager, and asked very audibly : ' What's that, 1Wfl.rin.TP Is that Hitalian ?' ' 'Lor no, dear; thafs French,' said Maria. Foreign critics say the English are wofully de ficient in modern languages. Perhaps so ! ?' Banks are numerous. The buildings fine. But the hotels . are legion. Aid yet it is noticeable, how many passers- by wear the blue ribbon. When I say hotels, I err. Public houses or drink shops there are in abundance, but the bona-fide first class family hotels, might be counted on the fingers of a one-armed soldier. Oram's hotel is comfortable, clean, quiet, and the host is obliging, and looks personally after the welfare of Ms guests. It is a favorite house, with passengers waiting for the San Francisco steamer, and tourists generally. I was glad to see our Premier, Sir Alexander Stuart,' here, looking ever so much better for his long rest and well-earned holiday. Let no visitor to Auckland omit a trip to Iforth Shore,; and a drive out .to. Lake Cakapuna. The scenery will amply repay the trouble, although in ?the latter is included a jolting vehicle, a larrikin driver, a pair of jibbing, 'horses, necessitating aj ?walk up evety incline over rough scorias or through blinding dust. Truth compels me to add that this was thfe only occasion on which I saw a badly-horsed conveyance roundabout Auckland^ As a rule, the visitor- will mark -with delight the grandly developed, robust, well-fed horses.

Australasia, aid the fish monger's shop and the fisherman fi. calling are TCr cognised as.' being of equal importance 'Vfith the butcher's or bakers. Soom surely for a new departure in our fish supply. - . : Butcher meat, too,' as I am on gastronomic topics, demands a word. The -beef and mutton in. Auckland are delicious. Immeasurably superior to the supplies common to Sydney— and the sausages ! My mouth watere ,yet as I recall tbreir succulent juiciness and exquisite flavor. The ordinary Australian sausage is a -B.M.— ra: bag of mysi ? ,,— so long as there is plenty of thyme and taefe ; it matters not how old, how black, how dry, and how unsavory the other, ingredients may be. The butcher's shops in Auckland, a're better than anything of the. Mud I had yet seen in the colonies, and it should be remembered, too, that the climate is more favorable to the trade than the sweltering heat of Mew South Wales. The shops are lofty, well ventilated, and scrupulously cjean. All interior arrangements .of hooks, blocks, and gear were evidently specially designed to suit the requirements of the meat trade. The chief and crowning exceHenrce, how ever, which is well .worthy of record for Sydney readers, was this. All the walls were inlaid with glazed encaustic tales. The counters were cool marble slabs. The windows were furnished with porcelain plates, and the whole looked so tempt ingly .clean and cool that I could not help wishing some * of our Sydney ' knights of the cleaver' ' would take a lesson, and be fired with a noble emulation to even outvie the Auckland butchers in obeying the dictates of common sense and the instincts of cleanliness. . Lake Takapuna, at North Shore, is a lovely cir cular sheet, evidently the crater of an extinct volcano. The black rugged masses of scoriffi all around leave no doubt as to its volcanic ante cedents. There are a few 'tame ewans on the lake, lovely ferns, orchids, and the crimson flowering pohutaukaua, or Christmas bush of New Zealand, fringe the steep banks, and the scene is one of perfect loveliness. The Maoris tell the legend that as Takapuna sank and filled with water, so Eangitoto, the steep mountain in the bay, arose. The energy and enterprise of the Aucklanders are here well exemplied in the use they make of the telephone. They have carried it across the harbor in sub marine pipes, and a lady on jNorth Shore can order her groceries and joints in town without going more than a few steps. Terrific gales occasionally rage here. We saw the devastating traces of one such, in myriads of half-prostrate young pine trees. The .sides which had been exposed to the gale were withered and shrivelled as if smitten by fire. Pines have been very extensively planted all round Auckland. They form quite; a feature in the scenery, and seem to thrive luxuriantly in the volcanic soil. So, alas, do briars and the Scotch' whins or furze, which some enthusiastic idiot has at some former time introduced from a mistaken sentiment of patriotism. . The furze, with its aggressive spikes and golden blossom, is becoming ubiquitous all over 3STew Zealand, and promises to become as great a nuisance in its way, as the briars of the west, or the prickly pear of the' north, are in New South Wales.
