BURRAJA RACES. (FBOM. OUB OWN COBBESPONDENT.) The annual Burraja race-meeting, held on the 9th inst., at Mrs. Darby's hotel, Lowesdale, passed off very successfully! although the raging of bush-fires on all sides interfered considerably with the public attendance. The various events on the programme drew good fields, and many of the finishes were grand. The weather was hot, though tempered by gentle breezes, and the few trees near the winning-post afforled pleasant shelter. There were between 300 and 400 people were present, among whom were a good proportion of those inveterate racecourse folk who inveigle you into tbe belief that every halfcrown you speculate must turn into a bright half-sov., and the high road to fortune is paved for you. They were rather out of proportion at Burrajaa to the gathering, consequently did not reap a rich harvest. There was good order throughout the day among the people. Mrs. Darby supplied at her hotel hard by—the races being held, like last year, in her paddock—an excellent lunch. The hearty manner in whicb it was partaken of, amply testified to the appreciation by all of the hostess's efforts. Mr. J. B. froughton, Mr. J.
