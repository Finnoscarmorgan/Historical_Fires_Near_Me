MOUNT VICTORIA The bush fires around here this last week have been something terrific, I regret to say that Leicester Cottage belonging to Mr C.W. Plummer was burnt down to the ground, fortunately a good deal of the furniture was saved through the help of a good number of the towns- people. I have pleasure in being able to record that the loss is covered by insurance. On Wednesday the township was dense with smoke. I am informed that Mr Hugh Cameron the manager for Kanimbla Station sent up for assistance as several of [the] fences were on fire. The main camp at the Kerrosene mine between Hartley siding and Bell was on fire. The fences on each side of the railway line between Lithgow and Blackheath were on fire on Monday night. At night the country toward Blackheath from Mount Piddington appeared like a wall of fire. LAWSON. Fires were raging in tlya.guljie.Bjs.nd^ hills^jp^ -Sunday and ?
