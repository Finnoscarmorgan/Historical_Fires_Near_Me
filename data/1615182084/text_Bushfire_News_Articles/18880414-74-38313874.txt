SONG OF THE SIINGLE SPITTERS. In dark, wild woods, where the lone owl broods, And the dingos nightly yell Where the curlew's cry goes floating by We splitters of shingles dwell. And all day through, from the time of the dow, To the hour when the ilopoke calls, Our mallets ring where the woodbirds sing Sweet hynns by the waterfal s. And all night long were are lulled by the song Of gales in the grand old trees; And in the brealk we can hear the lakes, And the moan of the distant seas. For afar from heat, and dust of street, And hall, and turret, and dome In forests deep,where the torrents leap, Is the shingle-splitters' home. The dweller in town may lie on down, And own his palace and nark; We envy him not his pleasant lot, Though we sleep on sheets of bark. Our food is rough; but we have enough Our drink is better than wine; For cool creeks flow wherever we go, Shut in from tie hot sunshine. Though rude our roof, it is water-proof ; And, at the end of the days, VWe sit and smoke over yarn and joke, By the bushfire's sturdy blaze. For awvay from din and sorrow and sin, Where troubles but rarely come, We jog along, like a merry song, In thile shingle-splitters' home. What though our work be heavy, we shirk From nothing beneath the sun; And toil is sweet to those who can eat; And rest when the day is done. In the Sabbath-time we hear no chime No sound of the Sunday bells; But Heaven smiles on the forest aisles, And God in the woodland dwells. We listen to notes from the million throats 0f chorister- birdson high; Our psalma is the breeze in the lordly trees, And our domne-the broad blue sky. O, a brave, frank life, unsmitten bY strife, We live wherever we roam; And hearts are free as the great strong sea In the shingle-splitters' home. 3 U eENeY KENDALL,
