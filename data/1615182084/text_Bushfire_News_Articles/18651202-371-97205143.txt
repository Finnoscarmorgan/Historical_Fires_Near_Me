The farther talk is ' that, i inconvenient and disastrous as his «ir« «umstaace« are, he mast continue to . bear his encumbrances, upper coat and . 4»S, and flounder -m or backward, -as the * «ase «iay be, ^etf-^sprived of all ihe* advantages which -responsible Govern went was ittteaded to wafer. . ? -- ? The talk is that Mr. Sasnto Ttas not ♦trengthened the opposition, nor weak-: ?ened tlie Ctotferameat by his, late no ' «confiden«e taotioa; that relief to thei ^s%^iatters^wast4w-t ^;^1ye^;^^ddfeat, '.- 'Tto^-the 'Government;' that this perpetual \- interference %ith the progress ef public business, and twaarabKBg &r; the salaried jposts » farli»meat, are becoming fieri ?onsly prejudicial, and must be made thei ?ubject of .grave deliberation and resolute; »ction on the part of the constituencies. The talk is that 'Fenianism' as re- cently developed in England, is a most strange affair; that the Irish people, now an equal and integral portion of the British Empire, have no sympathy therewith ;that notwithstanding its ab- surdity, South Australia may congratu- late herself on the occurrence of the disclosure, in consideration of the learn- ing which has been elicited from the Colonial press; that there can be no doubt the Feni, or Fenee, or Feeni, or whatever the Fenians were originally called, emigrated from Fairyland to Ireland about three centuries before the creation of the World, that shortly after the occurrence of that important event a member of the family made his way to England, and originated the Fens of Lincolnshire; that about fifty years before the accession of Alfred the Great, another member of the family, who, from the nature, of the country in which he resided was called Bog, crossed the Irish Channel in a hollow tree, adorned with some green flags from the nearest swamp, and with no «H*esr dothuig whaterer, except a shiflelaK; that tie name of the «aid TlSg was familiarly altered. to Boggy; that ^by^»'«OTrmpf*on, -or rather a con tferactionV/the »ame became Bogy, and aii an «,draaeed period-of life, the prefix ^,old' w% Introduce^ whence the well *od %ist«iie«ly known -' Old Bogy;'* that the same of the Eenisvn 'Old IBogy^ was for several centuries, and «evea-?« the «omm.eneement of the present, 'so terrible in ISngland that the severest threat which ©Quid, be used towards it child, was that of putting him in t&e; «oal hole, aa& sending far 'Old Bogy.' The farther talk is that .the late (intended) demonstration may be fairly designated by future historians ; the, 'Old .Bogy' invasion, or Insurrec tion, or whatever it jaay turn put to lave, been intended' to be, and that the Ya»kfio counterfeits of Irishmen who liave recently set the world grinning, may thanks their star* if their insignifi cance should avert from them the *&?»/«* which they so well -leserv«. The taut is that the ©lectors of Light on the occasion of the re-election, saw the matter ss between the candidates in the same Light as formerly, although they gave Rounsevell a much Lighter majority; that the district appears to have 'profited by the exposure of the r wholesale i^foranalitig; which took place on the weceding oecMion, the proper,* tion of informal rotes oa .Monday ha v- ing been unusually small. The talk is that while the municipal elections have excited an average amount of local interest, only one candidate has convulsed the community at large with anxiety ' »nd eitpefetation, that of ,Mr. Samuel Raphael, for Gawler, Ward,: Adelaides Before this paragraph shall liave been: transmitted fr-tta=ip^t-ho»ks aud liangeWS&to; lines, of pewter, .the, stupe^teus event will have occurred; in the meaawhile the talk is that the public of South Australia by some means must enlist in its service the master- mind of Raphael; that the only fault he possesses, that of taciturnity, will be probably cor rected by the provocations to speech which official life presents; that the city may look forward, {his election being secured) to a most dignified and success ful opening of the new Town Hall, to a most august oocupancy-hereafter of the civic chair, and the Colony to a future Member of Parliament and Prime Min ister, who will quietly but effectually cor rect every existing evil, and promote every possible good. The farther talk is that the town of Gawler- will have especial honor reflected on it through its name being identical with that of the Ward which the aocomplished Sam has chosen to represent. The farther talk is that other three Sams, not even known to the Electoral Roll, to attempt to usurp the mayoralty was an extraordinary affair, and that the assertion of Sam Hart to the Tele- graph proprietary and other portions of the press, that the affair was a hoax, is sin- gularly inconsistent with one sentence of the document; " I, Samuel Hart, con- sent to serve if elected.": That the similar declarations of Sam Pearce, and Sam Lawrence, if true, admit great read- iness to be hoaxed on the part of the municipal authorities, and a wholesale commission of forgery by somebody. The farther talk is that some person or per sons unknown must have been "standing Sam' to an .extent beyond the limits of propriety; * The talk is that Ladt- Berd's appeal in Tuesday's Expr&s; to scientific readers to explain tlie disappearance of aphides from his own raad air. Beresford's gar .. den after their '«rholesalj&4estru«taen by tBat eoonmou r^MtfUf. %s*?^» ,§».- J*&j;' bird;-* is aji unnecessary intrusion on the refoose of the scientific; that Lady-bird wul, see it is unnecessary to explain the theory, the matter ^ing'whoHy t*acti caij a»d occurring thus— the Juady-bird swallows the aphides ; after whi^practjl eal,-'abd iioi theoretical operatiosM thfe Utter, necessarily disappear, and dia&*b-' iume. the destruction of ajpple^blostoat, andothervegetadon. The talk is that raembers of Parlia ment, and even municipal officers ought to be able to'Vead and wrl|e,«veu ^where orthography is ;©e-jentrM^ |tnd tf&metic; out of the questkm; that ex-miniaters, and chief magistrates might reaaouably be expected, Si addition to Xave formed some acquaintance -with : Xandiey ^urray, and that the following advertisement; would not be inserted in any school book tmlees to v©xereise pupOs in the task of correction, both of -grammar and style : — . ^T^W OF GKEKKLG-^-I hereby give; riot»e that no person has. been 4i»ly uoxoiaated as Owincillcw for Jfew^GIenelg Ward, or as Anditore of the TdwiC' anid toat the nomina tion for these 'Offices will takejilace at the Town Clerk's Office, -jHenelg, on Tuesday next, Noyepaber ^8, at 12 noon, and that if niore persons shall then be swminated than is required to serve, the election will take place on the 1st. December next. *H. B. T- STSAKGWAYS, Hayor. Th§| farther talk is that the facts are strange that .'no person' has been aom inated as ' Auditors . of the Town,41 and yet that 'more persons' may 'be&omi-; Bated than « required to serve.' The talk is that the dissolution of the Pastoral^ Asseeiatioja is. scarcely ac counteil Jbr- by the reasons assigned for that measure'; that the **reverses,' add consequent 'depression,' by whi^vthe Bquattera have been visited, are rather reasons for the existence of a committee to watch over the affairs of a body so critically placed than otherwise, but that the dissolution would furnish an addi tional reason,' if one; were required, why that interest in its depression shouid receive the sympathy of ihe. public, and justice at the hands, of Government. The farther talk is that the pastoral interest already possesses the one, and will riot fail to realise the other. The talk m that the Ifeyi&er;'* article on Tuesday, on bush-fires, is a well- timed caution to the colonists at large, but that the following '-statement is unquestion able :-~The most provoking part of the whole affair is the fact that in almost every instance the-fire is the result of sheer thoughtlessness or unpardonable uegligenee;' that the Jfejrwfe?*' surely cannot intead. to assert that it would be' more satisfactory if our bush-fires origin i,ted in. personal m*Uoe, or fatuous ittr_ eendiarism. . Thft.tidk is that the meeting of out; Hebrew fellQW-coionistS'Oa occasion of the distribution of prizes to the children of the South Australian Jewish Sabbath Bchool, was a very delightful one ; that really religious persons of all denomina tions must be gratified at the social harmony and .cheerfulness which pre vailed throughout the proceedings pthat the report of the meeting in the columns of the Register newspaper is; worthy of that journal, being liberal, circumstantial, and comprehensive, but that the reporter omitted one statement of considerable importance to th« less learned of our fellow colonists, namely:— From what language 'the' Hebrew translation ' ©£? the OQi Testament scriptures^ wherein the children were examined, was origin ally derived? The talk is that societies such a s ' the South Adelaide Wesleyan Mutual Im provement Association,*' notwithstand ing the serpentine, elongation of their names, are calculated to be very useful to the rising generation ; that Mr. Pwigg's essay on ??** eompetitipo,' should sreite exteasWe competition throughout the colony ; that, as1 there is undoubted truth in the adage 'as the twig is bent, the 'tree's inclined,' the bent of mind displayed by Mr. Twigg should be encouraged by all braaehes of Colonial society.; »nd farther, that ?{£ such were the case, Cur jarors^wbull'iiot .be Hable lieseafter to be twigged for putting crosses to their verdicts instead of signa tures, nor ex- Attorney- Generals for con Ebundmg singular and plural in official documents. ????-? * ' ' ' \ . The talk is that advertisements in, our. aewspapers, however brief, are rarely so definite and precise as they should be, when the elasses of persons' to. whoni they are specially addressed are t^k^i. into, consideration p1 that the current advertisement of Mi4! Darwent, w Wanted & Stonedresser,' is a case in point; that oewly arrived ships* cooks, 'or helpers at Englisli eating-houses, Iknowing tnat the Australian rule is contrary to everything European, may naturally suppose that a person is required to prepare for table some edible mineral, and that stone masons may naturally suppose that a person is required *o chisel , drapery appertaining to pieces of statuary; the farther talk is that if Mr. IJatwent* simply, requires a cool and; .^ durable, aftiele of r kitchen fuirotareT^* sibnW dress^r, h* iaayeasify obtain ft of Keliet, Cox, or? some ?thejr ncaghbo*, ^without und,uly exciting expectation in the minds Cffin^strious, out not oyer literate men, The talk is, that however intent on "turning those fellows out," Mr. Strang- ways will probably now have to wait till next April for the opportunity ; that Mr. Santo's gold-laced livery runs some risk of becoming moth-eaten; and that Mr. Reynolds is fortunate as the fruit season approaches in not being jammed into a ministry at a period when the sweets of office are utterly overpowered by the anx- ieties of our Parliamentary atmosphere,
