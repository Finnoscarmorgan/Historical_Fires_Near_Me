ALLEGED DISTRESS OF FERNTREE GULLY SETTLERS. FERNTREE GULLY, Saturday. The local relief committee deny the statements made by Mr. O'Don, at a meeting of the Trades- Hall Council on Friday, that there were three families of burnt-out settlers living near him who had not been given any assistance. The commit- tee also deny that a man 6ft. high, and 40in. round the chest, was sent a boy's suit of clothes. The man referred to was supplied with a bundle of dresses, skirts, &c.;, for his wife, whom he had represented as being sorely in need, but because there were no clothes to hand at the time suitable for himself, he used vile language to a member of the committee, and threw the parcel at him. There is little doubt that the efforts of the committee to relieve distress is being rewarded in many quar- ters by ingratitiude, but they seem determined to carry their self-imposed task through, and deal out justice to all parties.
