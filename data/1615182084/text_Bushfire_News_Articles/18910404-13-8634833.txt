AN AUSTRALIAN DAY. BY EDWARD J. HART. "From the heights and hollows of fern and heather." From the windows of the railway carriage we could discern the promise of a typical Australian day. There was an intense warmth and brightness in the cloudless blue sky, the atmosphere, and all beneath, though it was yet early morning and people in the city were only thinking of rising from their beds. The hot northern breeze, not sufficiently fierce to be unbearable, was faintly scented with the odour of burning wood, and as we closed in with the range of the Dandenongs we saw the ominous smoke of many bush- fires flecking, where they did not totally ob- scure, the hills, whose deep tint that morning rivalled that of those blue Alsatian moun- tains famed in a familiar ballad. From arid country roads the dust rose in clouds, and though the fresh greenery of orchard, field, and forest revealed the previous mildness of the season, the tardy summer now seemed meditating vengeance for his hitherto too tolerant reign. Landed at last at the little wayside station most inappropriately named Bayswater, dazzled by the white glare which came from everything capable of reflecting light and heat, we found the small coach rushed and fully occupied before we could reach it, and after some anxious inquiries as to the pro- bable extent of the forest fires, we gladly accepted the hospitable offer of a private conveyance. Once again on the road, the heat, the flies, and, above all, the dust, which came literally pouring into our buggy off the wheels, caused us to look forward to the day before us with anything but pleasurable anticipa- tions ; but such reflections ceased when we arrived at the pleasant villa of our host, whose hospitable reception soon in- duced a pleasant frame of mind. We were not altogether on pleasure bent, for the conservator of forests wished to in- spect the Sassafras and Ferntree gullies and surrounding forest, and decide on the practicability or otherwise of having a track made from one to the other, and several of the local residents proposed accompanying him on his visit of inspection. So shortly after 11 our party of eight well-mounted men, led by a forester on an exceedingly clever pony, rode out on to the dusty highway, which, however, we soon changed for a forest road comparatively free from dust, hindered with trees, and here and there patches of cultivation, which seemingly led into the very heart of the mountains. Our first halt was at a place called Hazel Dell, a verdant nook, nestling at the foot of the ranges, shadowed by Mount Corraworra- bool, and separated from the road by a creek spanned by a primitive bridge. Between the cottage and stables we drew rein, and rested a few minutes beneath the shade of some elders. Then we rode out by another track, and gradually ascending soon reached'the boundary ' fence of the Dandenong State Korest, a fact which was duly impressed upon lis by the sight of numerous notices nailed on trees offering rewards for the detection of, and stating the penalties in curled bj- heedless . lire-raisers and fern stealeis. * Heut und dust and other bources of aggravation weie now left behind, and while the mercury «vas mounting up to ninet) - the in the Binnie in Melbourne, we were riding through cool S) Ivan arcades, our hoises knee-deep in fern, following a track on either side of which ¡boluted tree-ferns, remarkable for height and stateliness, und resembling the graceful dutc-pulm's of Unstern hinds," alternated with the giant ömygdalinn, the emerald-leaved sassafras, and the innumer- able varieties of eucalypts. After surmount- ing the ridge the forest grew denser and denser as we descended into the far-famed Sassafras Gully, lill at length only a fugitive shaft of light could here and there strike through the interlacing foliage, and tip some delicate ,fiond or patch of moss with u I vivid ixrecn fire. We tethered the horses where the descent became too declivitous for safe riding, and then on foot descended to yet darker and cooler depths, till at length we reached the bottom of . the gully, and in the weird green t«vilight paused by the trickling sticamlet to mentally ask ourselves if heat and dust and glaiu indeed existed. The tree-ferns vveie of great height and beauty, and the timber mostly of large sine ¡ some of the fonner had assumed strange and grotesque shapes, were intertwined with various trees, and in one instance a slen- der straight-stemmed sapling'had grown right through the Bhaggy broivn trunk of a tree- fern, «vhich ..was furtively trying to conceal itself beneath some delicate clinging growth.. In the fern gullies decaj- loses much of the hideousness we usually associate willi its aspect, and is scarcely less'beautiful than adolescence. Here was the prostrate trunk of a great amygdalina, fallen in combat with the winds of heaven, which, true to its nature, had perished first at the heart, the hollow* stem presenting the appearance of an enormous cavity. This was rapidly disappeoring beneath a verdant coating of moss and fern and lichen ; delicate creepers wreathed their tendrils about the branches, and waving staghorns plumed the fallen length of the uprooted giant,; so that it proved more channing thus, in ruin, than when, firmly rooted in the soil, it looked down with contempt from its lordly height on ambitious and aspiring saplings. Here, in the heiutof this sylvan wilder- ness, it was hard to realise that we were only 24 miles from the metropolis, that an hour and a half's travel- ling by the slowest of slow trains, a twenty minutes' coach ride, for which only the modest fare of a shilling is demanded, a pleasant walk up the mountain and down into the gully, would have enabled anyone languishing in Melbourne that hot Monday to have shared in our pleasures. Doubtless as it becomes better known, its nearness and accessibility will render Sassafras Gully a very popular resort, and every provision is being made for this contingency. The track is well defined and kept, and frequent notices appear indicating the road in and out, for the guidance of those whose ej-es are not sufficiently accustomed to the woods to detect the blazes or axe-marks on the trees. Besides this every effort is being made to preserve the beauties of the place from the spoiler, and idough within the district tree-ferns are still cut down, stolen, and destroyed, no pains will in futuie be spared to detect and punish offenders. A number of honorary Crown Lands bailifls have been appointed in addition to the officers of the Forestry department, and these and other local residents are full of enthusiasm for the safeguarding of their scenic treasures. Even a sense of due appreciation seems awakening in the public mind, and «ve pass a pWnic ! party who, for the enjoyment of their midday meal, have not thought it necessary-accord- ing to ii too frequent practice-to tear down u dozen or so of fern fionds in order to form a tablecloth. With a last regretful glance at this charm- ing scene, we ride out into the sunlight and along a table-land where the fern reached saddle high, and from whence we could see the bush-fires, fanned by the strong breeze, making devastating headway. Forest and glade, thicket and clearing, suc- ceeded one another w ith rapid alternation, till at length all but those familiar with the ranges had completely lost their bearings, mid were only conscious of the sensation of being as far removed from cities and civilisa- tion as if the Dandenongs were situated in the heait of Australia. Riding thiough a coppice of toll trees we sudden!) light on a deserted cottage, built of rough slabs, the glass of the windows broken, and with three horse-shoes nailed on the cloBed door, as if in the spiiit of satire at the good luck which assuredly hud not long abode in that lonely and desolate tenement. Here a discussion arose as to the practicability of following, the route of the proposed track'-'.i horseback", some maintaining that it «vus quite teasiblè for our steeds, while others held that the scrub was too dense to allow of theil passage, and suggested " hanging up our horses " and attempting the descent to the creek on foot. To the relief of the lazy ones of our party, i included among whom was the writer, it was determined to try the former plan, and proceeding at a walking pace, following one another in Indian lile, we entered the thickest forest it lias ever been my fortune to ride through. The trees seemed to stand ever closer together as we advanced, while the undergrowth was so dense that it was beside the question to think of look- ing to the footing of the horses, and a deep hole in our path might have entailed serious consequences. M*e were descending most of the time, but for the greater part of the woy it was im- possible to see half-a-dozen yards ahead, and white it was necessary to keep very close to the man in front, in order not to lose sight of lum and get bushed, this close proximity involved the unpleasant risk of getting struck by rebounding branches. Track there wos absolutely none, it was simply a case of follow ing the line of least resistance. The forester on his clever pony Barney led the way, and the manner iii which that small animal bored through seemingly impenetrable thiekets, disentangled himself from the branches of fallen trees and clinging creepers, and climbed over obstacles considerably higher than himself, wos enough to make an acrobat become jaundiced with envy. In the smallness of his mount the forester had an advantage over the rest of the party, for he could scramble through openings next to impracticable for horses, and he was constantly disappearing from view, whereupon-the whole cavalcade come to a halt and yelled (or him toietum and lind us a pnssuge. Australian liorses never stood higher in my regard'than during that bush ride. The maris I rock negotiated the most treacherous foothold without a serious stumble, and though fur removed from the typical bush horse, for Bhe possessed both blood and breeding, her readiness in answer- ing to the rein, her avoidance of trees anti stumps, and adroitness in keeping from jumming me in the narrowest of awkward places, was worthy of a veteran stock horse. Company is n grand thing under certain circumstances, and it was afterwards gener- ally admitted that few- of us alone would have undertaken this trip through the scrub, which together wus endured with cheer- fulness, and furnished a source of consider- able amusement. At last, with no slight feeling of relief, we struck ii cleared truck, and after descending a very steep pinch we reached the Dandenong Creek, where, for tim first time since we Btarted, we were enabled to water our horses. The ascent on' the other side was at about the same angle as nn ordinary hoime-roof, but the slope was compaititiv ely free from timber, anti the track boie some resemblance to a rough, narrow road. As we mounted higher and higher we weie enabled to obtain à view across the gulch of the woods we had just penetrated, and the outlook was re- markably fine and imposing. It was simply a wallof livingforest, seeniinglyimpenetrable, stretching unbroken almost from the bottom of the creek to the crest of the range, here- abouts probably l,GO0ft. in height. Not ii patch of eierlh or rock, apparently not a hand's - breadth - of clear space was'dis- cernible in this mass of vegetation, and it presented the appearance of a closely interwoven screen of star-like tree-ferns and umbrageous tiectops, on which the sunlight produced strange effects of colour. Here the fronds andcuculyptusleaves appearedosilvery grey, us if powdered with line dust ¡ there they ilumetl in the glory of green and gold ; while lower down in the shadow a dull dark blue prevailed, and over all a thin trans- parent film of smoke rose like incense from an unseen altar. But the Ines which produced tina smoke were not of the sucnticiil onlcr- at least, not in the sense s)mbolicul of voluntaiy worship of anything good or beautiful-but w ere rather the familiar curse ot the Australian Summer, which )carly la)s waste fun tracts ol couutrj \s we reach the saddle and peer dow n into tlie valle) on the further side «ve see that the opposite spur is totally obscured bj a thick ouitam of «vhite smoke, on which lund red streaks like splashes of blood now und then occur, und, indeed, the grass at our -vei) feet is fluming anil crackling, and the post and rails fence on cither side of us is uh(,lit in several places, while tices all round about dot the foreground like pillars of smouldering flame '1 he conservator of forests is far from dis pleased to see these fires
