The country is beginning to look verj dry, but, withal, there is no scarcity of grass and water These are still plentiful, though it would be better for stock if we had some rain to freshen up the feed. Cattle and sheep are looking remarkabh well, and it is pleasant to hear from all sides that the foot rot and worm diseases which played such havoc with the flocks in the immediate neighbour hood of Dubbo are rapidly disappearing In a few weeks, it is hoped that all signs of these very annoy- ing scourges will have disappeared altogether Shearing is oy er, and the clip is much lighter than it was last j ear This is doubtless to be accounted for by the severe season we have passed through -a season that did not allow sheep to get into condi- tion There is, ive notice, a desire to sell wool m the grease, owing to the exceptional price it is bring ing in Sj dney and Melbourne The demand for it bj the American buyers has been great, and rates have been paid out of all proportion to previous quo- tations Withal that, however, it is very questionable whether selling in the grease is the most profitable course for pastoralists to pursue, for the wool this year is remark- ably free from dut, and the weight of greasy and scoured and washed shows very little difference We know from the acknowledgments of gentle- men who have sold recently in Sydney, and got their wool scoured, that the amount of dirt in the fleece this year is very little compared to that of previous years The pnce which some of the local wool is fetching m the metropolis is very encouraging A parcel of the double anchor fleece (Mr Heane s, of Barbigal), brought recently as high as 10|<L It was scoured by Messrs Atkinson and Bean, of Slasher's Flat The country along the Talbragar looks very well There is plenty of feed, but a little ram would not be inopportune Thereisanyquantityof bushfires burning at various parts of the Talbragar country, caused, as they invariably are, by the carelessness of travellers, who will not extinguish fires, notwith- standing whatever Afits of Parliament may say Between Falconer's and Gulgong the country is somewhat bare, but this is doubtless owing to the great traffic that has recently been earned on on that road. The Dubbo stock items are -200 fat cattle (Dight and leomans') passed Dubbo on Monday, en route to Sydney via Mudgee Mesara.
