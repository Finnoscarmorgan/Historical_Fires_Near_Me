SHEEP HUSBANDRY ON THE FARM. BY BEONL No, IV.-CONCLUSION. It must be admitted that in undertaking sheep-husbandry, whether he elects to fatten aheep for market or establish a permanent flock m « regular forming operation, the farmer will bare much to contend against. Sheep-hnsbandty, like every occupation in life, Is not "all skittles and beer." He wilt have many disappointments to pat up with, and often serious losses will occur, bat in the end, 1 believe, it will be fonnd that the flock will always amply repay the care and coat it entails. The most hopeful thing connected with the business of sheep-farming in Victoria is that the greater portion of the difficulties met with axe . not doe to the climate and soil bat to the culpable negligence of the colonists themselves. As sheep-husbandry becomes more praotised by Victorian farmers we may hope that most of the drawbacks to the businese may be almost, if not entirely, removed. The climate and soil of Victoria are naturally so well suited to sheep-farming that it might lMSftid there are no n&toral; diseases among aheep in the colony. Scab was an Introdaoed disease, and has long since disappeared, having been permitted to ezut in the coontry a mnch longer time than there was any necessity for, to the discredit of the sheep-farmers of ihe day; -fbotiot is mainly confined tothe-rioh, moist lands of the Western district, where it has not given noehtaoiripleainoe long wools replaced the meri&os.; W]iBa foot-rot if very bad the propcietorof theabeepis 4ftpi mow to bU^fOrnegleot than the character of the s^ for. vnlwBC 4i«M* The most .foi&i;&able; obstacle toshesp-bisbandrr on MM* tofetfid of, ere the iitasj tfogs who ramble oaftfnigbl&btnttpaU; townships, digging*, ^ol^ bom farms.

U fires are often set down to a pieoeof s broken bottle acting as a burning-glass by drawing the rays of the eun to a foous. For m own part, I doubt if ever a fire originated in this manner; but of this I am positive, tb&t; 99 out of every 100 bush fires are due to the culpable negligence of smokers, or the teckleBS indifference of travellers, who justify burning a whole country side on the plea that it is only the squatter, and that the loss of tbe farmers' fences will give some one work. Tbe general habit of emolting has led to many a disastrous bush fire; when the pips is lit tbe match is thrown away, it being' too much trouble for the smoker to see that it is extinguished before parting with it As for a cover to a pipe, that is too much to expect from a man who has to attend to his work and at the same time keep alight the sacred fire oi his pipe. By fat the Doet frequent cause of bush-fires is the "sandowner," that unpleasant and useless product of the climate of Australia. Too indolent to make the least exertion and too indifferent to care for the lives and property of others, he sees a fire spring from his noon tide camping-place without making the (lightest attempt to extinguish it What does it natter to him if it destroys the flocks and pastore of the man who gave him food and shelter the previous night ? Once started, a buBh fire sweeps away the farmer's few acres ts readily as the broad pastures of the wealthy proprietor, and the stack with which the farmer hoped to tide over a bad season may to in a few minutes reduced to ashes, and ftm he has no alternative bat to sell his sheep at any sacrifice. The providing of sheep with food daring fbe dry season when grass runs short or is so withered that there is no sustenance in it. is a work that should be more oongenial to the firmer than to the large flock owners of tte country. With a portion of the farm devoted to the growing of lucerne, wmtpii owe, sorghum, or hay, he shoald be able to keep his sheep in fair condition even in the tot worst seasons, and should these fail a tad time may be tided over by a well-kept teckof straw.
