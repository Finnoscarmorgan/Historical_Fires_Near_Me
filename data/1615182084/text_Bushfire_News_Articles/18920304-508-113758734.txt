Great Bush Fire. Takwobth, Friday. â€” A fierce bush-fire has been raging for the past tew days on the far side of Wentworth Mounds, to the east of Tainworth. Last night tbe fire came over and round the hills, the spectacle being very grand. Lines of fire a mile long marked the various cattle tracks across the ridges. The vallies are full of fire, and the hillsides dotted with thousands of burning trees. This morning the fLe has somewhat abated.
