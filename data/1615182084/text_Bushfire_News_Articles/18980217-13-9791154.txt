Now that the changed weather has almost ex- tinguished the bush fires in the Sassafras Settle- ment in this district, it is realised how serious they have been. A number of settlers have been burnt out altogether; Alfred Hussey, Slater Bros., William Hackett, Alexander Miller, Quinton Brothers, William Gillman, Herbert Clifford George Brown, Thomas Brown, J. Bryant, and H. Howard losing their homes; in most cases also suffering the loss of the furniture and the other contents of their houses, besides fencing and cul- tivation. Other settlers have also suffered losses more or less severe, and the position is a most pitiable one.
