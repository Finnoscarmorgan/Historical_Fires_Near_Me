THE COUNTRY. BUSHEIRES. LARGE EIRE NEAR MENINGIE. Meningie, December 6. One of the largest fires ever known in these carts occurred on Mr. T. Bowman's Campbell Park run yesterday, by which over three parts of the run were destroyed. It was only by hours of hard fighting that the homestead and woolsheds were saved, and had it not been for a small lucern pad dock nothing could have prevented the flames making a clean sweep. Several men em ployed by Mr. Bowman at Lovedy Bay almost got the fire under, when a strong gust of wind threw the flames over their heads and swept over the run at a terrific speed. The men, who had horses, were barely able to get away. The fire has now burnt out. It is re ported that all the ostriches and stook on Mr. Bowman's estate are safe. The cause of the fire is at present unknown. Milang, December 6. The fierce heat of yesterday started a terrific bush fire in the vicinity of Campbell Park, a run some twelve miles from Meningie. The flames rose to a great lieighb, as they were clearly visible from Milang. No details have come to hand concerning the damage done, but from the magnitude of the fire it must have been considerable. Melrose, December 4. A large bush fire has been burning at the back of Mount Remarkable for the last two days. No particulars are yet to hand.
