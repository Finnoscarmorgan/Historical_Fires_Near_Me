BURNT TO DEATH IN A BUSH FIRE. LOCH, WEDNESDAY, Jan. 12. Patrick Connelly, of South Melbourne, a married elderly man, who was assisting Mr. Callanan in the survey of a dense scrub land between Loch and Jeetho yesterday, is thought to have been overtaken by a bush-fire while Mr. Callanan went a mile away for water. Large search parties were out after him yesterday and to-day. Connelly's instruments were found burnt, but no trace of Connolly himself has been discovered, and it is now feared there is no hope that he has escaped burning. The fire has obliterated all the tracks. Black trackers would not avail to find Connelly, and he could not have possibly been half a mile away from his instruments when he was missed. Search parties will resume searching for him to-morow. Thousands of acres of grass and miles of fencing have been destroyed by the fires this week. A cool change has supervened within the last two hours. FURTHER DETAILS. JEETHO Wednesday, Jan. 12. Mr. Callanan had with him besides Patrick two axemen. They started yesterday to survey some land and 1 mile from Jeetho station, and were in fallen scrub up to 11 o'clock, when the surveyor and two axemen went to look for water, which was only a few chains away. Connelly was very exhausted at the time, and asked the others to bring him back a drink. In the meantime the scrub caught alight, and in a very few minutes it was one roaring furnace. The surveyor and the two axemen managed to get out, but not trace of the man Connelly can be found anywhere. The plumb-bob and the end of his chain were found last night late, and this afternoon the reamins of the theodolite were discovered, Mr Con= nelly has been for many years employed in the Lands department as chairman.
