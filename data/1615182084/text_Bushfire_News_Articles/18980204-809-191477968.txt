FIRES IN OTHER DISTRICTS. DAMAGE ABOUT DROMANA. DROMANA, Wednesday. A fire, fanned by a strong south wind, has swept down the side of Arthur's Seat, through Gracefield, towards the town ship. The roar of the flames was heard a couple of miles off. The house of a laborer named James Singleton was soon demolished, the family escaping with but what they stood in. The residences of Mesdames Tal- bot and Townsend were threatened, and the owners spent an anxious half hour. Had it not been for the exertions of others, these two fine houses would have fallen a prey to the flames. Roger's house was also threatened, the grass on the road close by catching fire. Down M'Culloch-street the flames swept to Rigg's house, which was saved after much exertion. On Sunday the fire again broke away, and extending through the park, it surrounded the ceme- tery. A band of salamanders, under Con- stable Jones, saved the graves from destruc- tion. The fire then proceeded through Bear's land, into Burrell's pre-emptive right, in which it burned fiercely all night, the residences of Messrs. Burrell, Daven- port, Cornell and Coburn being in great danger. The orchards of Messrs. Cussons, Head, Hopcroft and Sheehan have been greatly damaged.
