TRIRALGOA N SOUTH. [FROM OUR OwN CORRESPONUDEN.] November 19. The weather is so exceedingly hot for the time of year that I am afraid we shall suffer greatly for want of rain ere winter sets in. But still there is consolation in the thought that we have a good, permanent stream of water. Bush-fires are putting in an early appearance this year. Yesterday the smoke curled thick about the place, heralding the near approach of this terror of the summer months. The selection recently purchased from Mr. Fisher by Mr. J. Jones, of Callignee, is undergoing a great change. Mr. Jones is having all the timber grubbed.and burnt off,and already the land is presenting quite a different appearance, and when the work in hand is completed, it will rank among the best improved farms in the district. Our local anglers have not been very successful this season, but I dare say as the season advances fish will become more plentiful. The Show, of course, attracted a host of our residents, but if the weather had proved more propitious, a larger number would have grasped the oppor tunity of inspecting the productions of the rich surrounding districts. I hear that our worthy State school teacher, 3Miss E. H. Leslie, is about to be removed from here. This fact will be learned with deep regret by all our residents, more especially those who have children attending school, for ever since she has been here she has proved herself a thoroughly efficient teacher, her pupils having on many occasions attained the highest percentage obtained in Gipps land at the annual examinations. Miss Leslie will carry' with .her the kindest wishes: for her welfare by all the residents.
