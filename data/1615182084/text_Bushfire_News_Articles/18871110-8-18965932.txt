BUNGWALL. A Distinguished Visitor. - The somewhat monotonous expression of this little town was re- lieved last Friday by the visit of R. H. D. White, Esq., our esteemed friend and ex-M.L.A., who arrived here, accompanied by Mrs. White and daughter and other members of the family, and aeveral ladies and gentlemen friends of Mr. White's, in that splendid little craft the King- fisher, a steam launch which Mr. White had, at a considerable cost,, brought from Great Britain. Mr. White was, as usual, liberal with his purse. A donation of Â£5 was given to the church, and a very handsome one towards the regatta at Christmas. I Our respected visitor was greeted warmly on his arriva], and similar expression was given on his leaving. Weather very dry. Bush-fires are raging. The teacher's residence and telegraph office were both in jeopardy on Saturday night. The Public school teacher, his wife and family were unable to retire to rest all that night, owing to the sparks which floated over the buildings in showers. The use of water, by means of a hose and pump, kept energe- tically active, brought under control those partB of the buildings which ignited. The teacher is without a supply of water. The roads are in want of a visit from the member. I find no improvement after eight months' visit. Thero ought to be a good buggy road through from Bulladelah to Bungwall ; it's time there was.
