Lighted matoliM thrown away by caceW*harvest hands, fragments of burning 1 tobatco blown out of uncovered pip**, hr ps thoughtlessly left by persons camping, or by farmer* in “ burning/' newspaper I wads used by amateur or juvenile sports (mcn, hot ashes carelessly thrown awby by resident* in country districts, sparks from locomotives, and lighted wax matches thrown out of carriage windows by passengers In trains, wax or lucifer matches dropped in paddocks and tiamped on by stock or human beings—these are a few of the more ordinary causes of the tires with which tbs much harried farmers and other landowners are vexed almpsl every summer. Lost week an outburst of this character on the late Mr. Joseph Bell’s estate was clearly proved to have been the act of a young woodcutter, and the Elmore magistrates, in fining him L5 for hi* reckless disregard of the property of his neighbors, let him off rather merci fully. As it is so seldom that a case of this character is sheeted home, the magistrates could not have been blamed had they made the punishment even more severe. Doubtlessly, however, it will after this week’s experience* go very hard with any other " lira raiser” who may bo discovered, notwithstanding that ho did not designedly intend to injure tho property of anybody. But such occurrences as those related in ex tenso in another portion of to-day's issue suggests the question, why do not our country friends inaugurate a species of fire brigade to cope against this partisular form of the firo-fieod ? In the North eastern district several of these brigade* were formed last anmmer, and if they aro still in existence doubtlessly goed work would be done by them were their service* required. Bush-fire fighter* would, of course, be *11 tho more effective for discipline and training, ju*t as the firemen of the town* can make short work of a conflagration against which ordinary citizen*, notwithstanding that thsy had the same appliances, would be comparatively helpless. \- . . ■-i 1 .— s jf\ rav;i Pack. —The follow to* additional rsadlng matter will bo found on tho fourth I page »—Mining Now* and Note*, Eaglchawk, Shearer*’ Conft rrnoe In Adelaide, I rlnce Bi* in»rok and the Young Kaiser, The ChUdion *nd tho Clfrgv, Melbourne, Tho Samihurat and Eiglehawk Electric Tramway Company, Spcr.- ing lotolligenoo and other Item*.
