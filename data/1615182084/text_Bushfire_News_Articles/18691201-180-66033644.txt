NEWCASTLE. From, our otcn Corresponletti. The ''latter rains' falling at ibe most critical time, have indeed caused an improvement to tbe crops. In some places undoubtedly the yield of gram will be scant, but generally speaking the ave nue quantity will be maintained. Hay-miking is well nigh finished, andin some instances the wheat harvest has commenced. Bush-fires have commenced early th;s season We have had two already, and both on the run of tbe Messrs. Clarksm. This is diubly calimilons, as owing to the short supply of r.iin at die early p?.rt of the season, bush-feed will be scarcer than usual ; consequently sheep farmers can i 1 afford to I:, S3 a blade of prass. The thought has several times o:currcj to me (bat clearing the runs from so much dead wood would be beneficial ; so much of diis timber not only prevents tbe growth of the grass in such paces, but also affords material for a Gre t - become more -1isastron- in \'% results. This is but an idei of mine, and must be taken for what it is wji 1I1. Our Cocrt h .use is u:: ler^uin^ a thorough repair, and not b -fore it was much required. Mr. Watson, ibe contractor, is doimr bis work well. We have long fe't the need of a sober and thorough practical builder, and Mr. tVatsun h tviug commecreJ busi ness in onr towu is rcaTy a benefit to the district. The disease known as whooping-cough is at present prevalent in tbe district. A case of sudden death o.-curred on Fri lav even ing, the 26' h instant.* A man named Booth, employed as uulkccper to one of Messrs. Clarkson's shepherds, suddenly fe!l dun deal wl:i!e in the act of preparinz to ma'-e a rt.isnpcr. l);-aib. sbtn!d at all times bring with it solemn thoughts, but it becomes doubly impressive when, a person in the full vigour of manhood is thus struck d.iwn wituon* one moment of preparation lor appearing before (he tribunal of his Maker. f:i such cases deatn shonld be a warning to the living.
