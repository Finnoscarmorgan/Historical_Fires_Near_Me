The principal event of the day was won by Walter Webb, George Walton being second, and Mat Williams third. In the evening a social took place at Mr. Jewell's, dancing being kept up till daylight. Songs were sung during the evening by Mr. Forrester, who sang "My Angel Mother's Grave," the key-note being struck by Mr. J. Beilly; al60 by Messrs Preston and Rosseau. Mr. 6. Plant gave a sand-jig in capital style, and was followed by Mr. Thomas Harris in the " Cart-horse Break-down." The honors of the evening fell to Miss Joinson, she being belle of the ball. Mr. Jenkins made a very efficient M.C. The music was supplied by Miss Jenkins (pianist) and Mr. EL Rosseau (piccolo).
