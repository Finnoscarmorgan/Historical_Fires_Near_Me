FIRES AND LOSS OF LIFE. [Br ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.] STAWELL, Thursday Evening. Two destructive fires occurred to-day, one at an hotel situated at Deep Lead, about three miles from Stawell, the other being a bush fire at a locality in the neighborhood called Doctors Creek.' The first fire broke out iu Pope's Deep Lead Hotel. All the particulars of this that are at present known are that the flames were first perceived at 9 o'clock this morning. The building, which contained eight or nine rooms, was whollv destroyed, with everything it contained. An unfortunate boy of three or four years of age, the son of Mr. Pope, the owner, was burned to death. It is thought the deceased was the cause of the fire, and that it originated through his playing with matches. The bush-fire at Doctor's Creek was first perceived to-dav at about 10 o'clock, and is supposed to have originated at Campbell's Creek bridge, four or five miles from Stawell. The flames traversed all M'ltellar's ground in the vicinity of Doctor's Creek, and also the farms of Mr. Grinter and Mr. Scallan. The width of the area taken by the ltumes was about 12 miles, the fire appearing to have broken out in four different places simultaneously. Many miles of country, chiefly grass land, have been devastated ; but no reports of crop losses have reached Stawell. except the destruction of one hay-rick. There were some narrow escapes of property, the most notable being Youldon's Hotel, near Green's Creek. This was principally saved by the presence of mind of Mr. T. Hogan, late a wine and spirit merchant here, and who is at present on a visit. The firemen were nearly all present, and a number of the police, besides about a hundred volunteers, all of whom did good service. The fire is considered to be sufficiently subdued to render lears of u further outbreak groundless. A good watch is being kept on the most dangerous places.
