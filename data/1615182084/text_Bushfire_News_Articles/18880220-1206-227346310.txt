TOONGABBIE. (From our o'en fjirr^jt-ion /satJ Mr Kitchin, who has for some time pas had an excess of work placed upot his , ,. -o-. o.- - j r JMuer his supervision, will now be relieved of Toongabbie by the appointment of M t R. Goodwin as revenue officer at tîiis place. Bush- fires are playing sad havoc in the ranges around Toongabbie by destroying the iiard-earned property of the splitters, there being large quantities of sleepers, posts, and piles, in the bush. Bash-fire.- mean ruin to these men, although sometimes they are the result of their oxn carelessness. Nor do the selectors and land-owners escape the ravages of fire, ami frequently fences, homesteads, and property to tbe extent of hundreds of pounds worth, are destroyed. The careless use of fire can not be too strongly condemned at this season of the year. There is to be a public meeting here on Tuesday 2ist (to- irorrow evening). Considerable excitement has been created by the Moe to Walhalla tramway, or railroad, being inclnded in the list of lines tor the next railway construction bill. Tlie general feeling here is that this dis- trict is entitled to a junction betwven the Thompson and Latrobe rivers on th m ii a Traralgon to Bairnsdale line, and t:i ;ir agitation for this line they a-e p-omised the support of the whole district from Tra- [ralgon to Bairnsdale. A letter published in the Maffra Sftecfator puts the matter of these rival routes — in a - forcible manner, and burls in tbe teeth of Sale quotations from a letter published in one of the Sale papers ; although it seems strange to realise that Sale should give any support to the Moe route. Tlie severance of die Toongabbie and the Denison Ridings has advanced another stage, notwithstanding tlie bunkum talked at the «reet vale of Roses.
