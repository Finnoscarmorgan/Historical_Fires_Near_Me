The dispute which has so long prevailed between the miners and certain claimholSera at Sandhurst has at length aaauiiied a positive stage. The attempt to redace wag&B; from £2 5s to £2 2s a .week was enfoj-ced last Saturday; and the resnlt was a general strike on the part of the men employed by_ the companies which;had come to tliat decision. The men refnsed' to accept? the lower rate ; the directors continued inekor able; and before night „ 160 men had volnn ^ tariiy eiirrendered: their employment. jrhe movement, however, will not end here. T|iere their. me'n^ noticeihat thV nma^adajtionl will made by them next Satnrday week." \- • • - • • The prospect, therefore, is before the com mnni^ that in a week -or ._two from bow there will be some.50d miners, or it may be more, oat of work, thrqngh the action of a few companies at Sandhurst, and the re fasal of the men to sabnut to their ctindl tione. Distant sis we are from the scene otthis imbroglio, we are not able, owing to the rather vagne. natnre of the information supplied, to deal with it, ab minutely as 'we ehonld lie. Bnt there are two or three facts in tins contest which are tolerably dear; and a few remarks on theee facts may not be altogether wasted. There appeara to be no reason at all why the delinquent companies ehonld have acted in the manner they have done. There seems to have been no falling' ofi in the prospects oL-the-sainea—atr ali events to necessitate a reBfiction in: the rate of wages; and one of the wealthiest men and most enccessfnl qnartz-reefers of Sandhurst is at the head of the movement. These ape sery ngly facte ; and they .speak trnmpet-tongned against the action of thbse who have provoked thiB . conflict between capital and labor.., Bnt supposing there had been a falling-ofi in the rjeeonrceB and prospects of the mines concerned—supposing that the mine-ownera foond they could sot joake-bothj ends meet, at the current rate of wages—even thrai there would bo no defence for their conduct. They could have fallen back upon the con tractor tribute system to meet the diffidilly and there is not a miner in the' Sandhurst clis trict who "would have objected to either of these proceedin^sij Either would have been s fair and stnughtforward course. The mineowners would havevirtuallyeaid, thatithey conld not pay their way under the old isystem, aud did not like to abandon the ground on that account. . They most, therefore, resort to one of two plans to make Itheir funds go as far as possible; and no working man could have objected to a step being; taken that is admitted to be fair and reasonable.'in every mining' and commercial venture.-- Nor would any- miner have demurred to this etep, because it would have appealed successfully to the instincts of fair play and reason. Bat theTnine-owners who have taken op the codgels in haw acted qtuto onj>°"H!o spirit to this.- They have not attempted to come to any terms with the miners, .which would, the long rnn, be mutually beneficial. On the contrary, they have ridden the high horse very determinedly,-and at last insisted upon the miners agreeing to their terms, or abandoning their work altogether. By a sort of Russian u£ase they announced that thewages would be reduced by 3s a week; anil they would listen to no argument that was orged By the other Bide why i&is; reduction should not be adopted. This feaB not treating the miners in a proper spirit; 'this was j not endeavoring to deal with the difficulty, Bupposing one really existed, in a bufiiness-like or reciprocal manner; and, therefore, however ffie sobject is viewed, whether there was a cause, or none at all, for a reduction to be made, .tha conduct of the companies concerned in this attack tipon the miners is certain!y". void of anything like reason : or justification.' .The whale affair, consequently, amounts to thk. The mine- ownera -want to feather their oasts at the expense of the miners, taking all the cream, and-leaving the men nothing >at the ekimmed; |nilk, ;whether. the dunes pay handsomely, or only moderately; Sand any etep that caiTbe deBcribed in a ^hraBe of this sort is open to the strongest possible reprehension. According to all accounts the average earnings of the miners at Sindhuret—-although; computed at the - rate of 7s4d ashiH, or £2 5s a week—have • not exceedM328, owingtovarioua causeswhich led toloaeof shiftsjand-theprinciple eeetrs to he striclly followed, in Sandhurst, that if no work can be done, there shall lie no payment, This is'not altogether ; a jdeasant Btatie of things for the mioere, however tolerable it may ' be in the case* -of a luge or. email .contract m other directions. But the fll-efiect Is. greatly increased when -even -the miserable pittance of {(2s-a week is koocked down 3s tt> admiDister to the greed of the jnine'^owaers. -Then, nuser^Ue As ihe wages were tefore, they become scarcely enough to keep body and sooL together,-and aM My^ing-^t na 'Credit to the district where J this cbeeae-paring economy'is attempted,- The iniiiera' wjrk is both labodoqs and hazardous. A fair rate of —wages—«hould - therefjwe, be grudged to Aem i>y° thei^,'^mployere; and any director who acts in a contiwy splnt to this ia a wronjg-doer, and a downright public nmsance.'Thesympathy, of all woiMng men, and a large number of persons tn a -diSeorent grade of Kfe^ will go with the Sandhoret minere in this «aBe, |md rightly so too, more particularly if they avoid «reafing .toy dtstuirbance.
