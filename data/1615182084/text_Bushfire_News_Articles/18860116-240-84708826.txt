OUR BULLUMWAAL LETTER. FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. Friday, Jan. 15. The heat has been very oppressive of late, and if this dry weather continues there will be a water famine. Numbers of miners have had to leave their claims at Merrijig for the want of water, and are now trying in the bed of Boggy Creek, the only place where there is water enough to try a prospect. Never in the memory of white men has the creek been known to be so low. Messrs. Brodribb Brothers are sink ing an additional 20 feet on the Golden Crown Lease, and the stone shows well, as they are going down. At the Sons of Freedom baling is continued, and a small paddock has been erected for the company's horses. Mr. Bird, one of the directors, and Mr. T. K. Smith, the legal manager, have been up to the mine, and in a short time work will be commenced in earnest. Mr. Ellis will put the new shaft in working order as soon as he has the necessary timber. A new discovery in reefs has been made here lately, and the prospector was kind enough to show me some speci mens, which are really good. If this sort of thing continues, Boggy Creek will become a second Walhalla. New houses have been erected here, and others are in course of construction. It has been rumored that some of our councillors are coming up to see what improvements are required on this road, and I hope they will turn up soon. The bushfires have done some damage, and parties visiting this district in vehicles have great difficulties to reach here. Now that this district speaks fair to be of some importance directly, the roads ought to be attended to.
