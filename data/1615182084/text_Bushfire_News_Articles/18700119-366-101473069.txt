WOODUOUSELEIGII. (FIroo our correspondent.) DunINa the last month we have had dry hot weoa ther; but on Friday last a sudden change took place and the rain fell in gentle showers. The wind, too, was very cold. The air is now nice and cool, and tha grass and potatoes look all the bhotter for the rain. Fortunately it was not heavy enough to do much, if any, harm to the wheat, which though reaped has not been carted home. Providentially no bush-fires have yet occurred in this neighbourhood; hut yeteorday news arrived here of a moast diabolical attempt to sot fire to IHo gall's crop at Carrahungla. It appears that about two o'clock on Sunday afternoon as one of the men was running some horses past a corner of one of the wheat paddocks, heo discovered it to be on fire. Ha immediately gave the alarm, and overy available hand wna spoedily on the spot, and after some very hard work succeeded in putting it out and confining the damage to the corner whero it broke out. Sub sequent investigation showed that a horse had been hung up to the fence close to where the firo was dis covered; and there wore tracks of it both going to and roturning from the spot, evidently point ing out the rider as the incondiary. It is to be hoped that such measures will be taken as will lead to the punishment of the wrotches who would soule in this cowardly manner that revengo they hand not coursago to take openly. Had the attempt been made a flw days hn fore, no earthly power could have prevented the destruction of the whole of thi paddock, as the heat of the sun had parched oeverything up,. The oelipna of the moon was seen to perfection. I don't think many persons turned in until they had soon the queen of night completely snuffed out. January 18th.
