THE MACARTHUR RUSH-FIRES. A gentleman who arrived in town on Friday even. Ing states that not tiie slightest doubt exists as to the origin of the fire in the Macarthnr district; it was no accident, bat must first hove bt-en started by one or more incendiaries. At about midnight on Tuesday a selector named Barry lint noticed bursting out on his land, but ro a riyp*d to extinguish them, whilst almost at the same moment another fire broke out on Mr Richardson's farm, and at three a.m. another commenced ou Mr Voisey*s land. There was no connection "between the throe fires, and they commenced on different sides of the road, clearly pro Ting, it is submitted, that tiie conflagration was not arridentally "vn^H fche loaers have been many small fanners. Had the fires first commenced on (he large estates it would only have been in accordance with tbe usual practice of " fire raisers," but in every ingfemf* alluded to small farmers were made the first victims. On Wednesday Mr Wilson, a poor selector, saw all Ilia land ran over by the Barnes, and himself and family rendered houseless. The unfortunate man, with his wife and six young children, are now accommodated in the quarters of Mr Smith, the schoolmaster at Deep Creek, and wlien our informant left there on Friday, it waa very doobtful whether tbe school -house would' 1>e saved. At that time the fire was -within a chain, or a rhain and a-balf, of the building, and although gap alter gap had been cut in the fence, the fiaines kept starting tip behind the willing wulXers, and thus ha>t managed to get so near the school. Mr Qenuuin^way's house also had a narrow escape. It is impossible to estimate "the damage that has been done; scores of miles -of fencing must have been destroyed; sheep, cattle, and horses have been" scattered all over tbe country; and on Friday evening there appeared little probability of the devastation being checked until everything combustible for miles round, had been destroyed.â€” Hamilton Spec- tator.
