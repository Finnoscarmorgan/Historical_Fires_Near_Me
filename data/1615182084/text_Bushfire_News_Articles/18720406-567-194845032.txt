Seconded by Cr. Thomson^ and carried.

In moving the resolution tbe President said the work was an expensive 'one, and there had been so much difference of opinion as to the site, that it would be better to give time for further consideration. Cr. Watson seconded. Cr. Bromell would not oppose the motion, for he believed that the ratepayers concerned would be able to settle the question of site, in a manner that would oe quite satisfactory. Carried. EETENX-E OFFICERS. Messrs. J. Beath and J.

Consequent upon the separation of a large portion of the West Biding, it was decided to constitute anew the boundaries of that and other Hidings ; still, however, retaining the old name of ' West Biding,' although, per haps, the appellation North Biding wonld have been more appropriate. The necessary steps were taken towards getting this altera tion, proclaimed in the Gazette. TENDERS.
