GREAT DESTRUGTION. SETTLERS DESTITUTE. NARROW ESCAPES. MELBOURNE, Friday. Telegrams from Gippsland show that the bush fires there did enormous damage. Hundreds of settlers have been burnt out, and reduced to destitu- tion, and many had a narrow escape from losing their lives. The loss of live stock is very heavy. The townships of Neerim and Thorpdale have been practically destroyed, and several other settlements narrowly escaped a similar fate. The damage is roughly estimated at Â£250,000. In addition to the fire in Gippsland, destructive fires are reported from Hastings, Avoca, Trentham, Gisborne, Lilydale, Mansfield, Paynesville, and Yea.
