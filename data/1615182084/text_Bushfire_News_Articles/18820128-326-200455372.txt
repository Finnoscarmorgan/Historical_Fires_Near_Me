ALBURY. (from our own correspondent.) Friday. Bush-fires still continue m the vicinity of Albury. The grass and fencing on two farms at the Nine Mile are burnt-; also part of Mr McKellar's run and" Mr Mitchell's, of Tabletop. I am informed that a considerable num ber of selectors within 20 or 30 miles of Albury have sold out to neighboring squatters within the last twelve months. Nearly a dozen were mentioned to me as having been bought out by one man. This is a great loss to the storekeepers and public of Albury. Every selector selling out means a loss of Â£100 a year to the tradesmen here, as squatters generally get their supplies direct from Melbourne and Sydney. A young man was charged before the Albury Bench on Friday with using in sulting language in a public place, and the offence being proved, he was heavily fined. In connection with this and several other cases of a similar nature that have been brought under the notice of the magistrates lately, I consider the police are to be complimented upon the manner in which they are trying to put down such an evil. Females cannot walk the streets or sit at their own doors in the cool of the evening without their ears being assailed by language of the most offensive cha racter ; and your correspondent, on taking his young boys down for a batli'e in the river, has heard from boys of about 12 years of age, language of the most abomi nable character. A fire occurred at the rear of the pre mises of Mr G. Hunter, Dean-street, store keeper, yesterday afternoon ; but it was fortunately noticed in time. As we have no water and no fire- brigade, the central block in the town would have gone if the flames had got headway.
