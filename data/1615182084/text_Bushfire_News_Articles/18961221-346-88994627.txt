HUNTLY, SATURDAY. . SCARCITY OF WATER.-There has been a lot: written from here respecting the water supply," and as has been the case every summer for years past, it is the same now, only that with every summer the supply gets shorter; in fact, it reminds me of this place some 40 years ago, when to get water for domestic purposes there used to be; holes sunk near the dry watercourses, securely logged over the top, and closely watched, or; the logs would be removed, and the water; taken. But as some of the old residents! say, there is a material difference now, as the water mains are laid to our doors; but the water-where is it ? From early morn till late at night there is scarcely a drop to be had. It has been asserted that go where you will you can get what you pay for ; but here, although the water rates have to be paid, the water can not be got. The ratepayers consider that the council, as custodians of the rates, should de cline to pay the Government for what they do not get, or t.ike immediate action to have the water mains enlarged so that the whole of the water cannot be utilised for gardens before it reaches Huntlv. POLICE COURT.-At the Police Court, Mr. Dwyer, P.M., and Messrs. Britt and Goyne, Js.P., presiding, G. W. Woodward was sum moned for non-compliance with the Vaccina tion Act, and was fined 10s, with 2os costs. One civil case was disposed of, and the court adjourned.
