Dislnucrtivs. FIru.--On Saturday last as the mail trus was passing Now Lawn (near Wagga \VWaggs), a spark fromn the nougine set firo to Bald win's house grass paddockl. Mr. Baldwin saw the grass take fire and oudeovourod to put it out, but it rapidly spread throgis a lano into Hayes' wheat paddock, and 60 acres of standing wheat, on which tlo striltlpper was to have beeou put on Monday, caught fire. ThIe fire destroyed about one mile of flecing, notue outhouses, sld ilu orchard containing many years' growth of fruit-treeos; also stockl-yard and gallows. The hlouse itsolf was saved only by great exertion of unighbonro and friends, and it wns near upon sovoue o'clckt befioro the lire was oubduoed. The paddock of 50 acreos of swheat was totally dos troycdl. Adjoiuing thereto was aoothcer paddockl of 97 seacs; bet rnuning alongside hlo fnceo and divid ing the two paddocks lay a green slip of about throee seers. Had this caught, nothing could have Ipreventled thle fire spreading to the larger paddoek, swhlich contained 150 tons of wheat and hay stacks, the crops theore haIving buoun haIrvested. VWe under. stand that Mr. HLayes is about to itstitutt proceed. ings against the Government for loss3 sustained. Tuhe growing crop was fully 100 yards fromn the railway liue, and also protected from its boundarias by chipped lanes. There was either nio park. catcher attached to the euginuo which was the cause of the destruction, or if so, it signally failed to per form the fIuctions clainmted for it.--Wagga Wagga E~xpress.
