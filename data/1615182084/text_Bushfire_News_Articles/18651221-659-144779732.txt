To the Editor of the Tumut and Adelong Times. Sir, — A paragraph in the issue of your paper of the 14th instant, states that you have been informed the free-selectors set fire to the grass on Gocup run for tho purpose of driving the sheep away, and that Mr. Rash removed his sheep in consequence. Will you permit me, through your paper, to state that you have been misinformed. Mr. Rash has not left, and with reference to the bush fires, no person - free- selector, farmer, squatter, or any one else, owning but a single beast would be fool enough - supposing them to be devoid of moral restraint - to burn grass such a season as this; sheep, compared to bush-fires are a benefit to any district; fire will not only run from Government on to private land, shaving grass closer than sheep ran on its way, but will, with im- punitv, attack dwellings, stacks, fences, &c.;, without being subject to the expedient of being impounded, which is available to the injured party when stock trespasses. To the carelessness of shepherds in leaving the fire used to prepare their noon-day meal are the ruinous bush-fires of this season mainly at- tributable. If proof is necessary witness the burnt state of the country downwards from Tarcutta along the route sheep travelled up. Your obedient servant, A FARMER, Tumut, 15th December, 1855. [Whilst willing to admit that many bush fires are occasioned by the careless neglect of shepherds or others, we have it from the best of authority that the Gocup run was positively set on fire for the pur- pose of driving off Mr. Rash's flocks;j and we have also had related to us the expressions made use of at the time by the man (?) who did it. At the moment Mr. Rash was leaving Gocup, arrangements were made for a water supply, consequently he then remained. — Ed. T. & A. T.] j
