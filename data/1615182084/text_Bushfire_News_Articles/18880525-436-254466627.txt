TO THE EDITOR OF THE ALBURY BANNER. SIR,—I have read with interest the letter of " Farmer" re the proposal vo empower the Pastures and Stock Board to prevent anyone from burning off stubble, &c.;, between October and May, and fully agree with him that all fanners should not cease to agitate until such a resolution is consigned to the waste-paper basket. That such a law is altogether unnecessary is amply proved by the fact that large bush-fires very sellom originate from these sources, and that the penalty proposed by "Farmer" would provide good security against carelessness. I venture to assert that no farmers would wish to restrict their neighbours or themselves in the manner proposed ; and, assuming this, it simply places the agricultural interest at the convenience of the grazier, for it must be well known that in this district many farmers have ploughed their land and are sowing in April, and if Btubble is not burned before April it cau in most cases not be burned at all; so that I maintain the 1st March, as the law now stands, is quite late enough. My opinion, in short, is tbat if the resolution had been intended to enable the Board to—indirectly but surely—crush out agriculture, they could not have hit upon one more to the point. Trusting you will do me the favour to insert this,—I am, &o.;, FARMER AND GRAZIER.
