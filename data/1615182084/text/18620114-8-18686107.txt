DISTRICT NEWS. From our own correspondent Scone. There was no business done at our Police Court last Friday, owing to the absence of the Police Magistrate, who was on an official visit to the Denison diggings, and we have little or nothing to chronicle by way of news. The weather during the past week has been most dis- tressingly hot, the sun burning up everything in its course. We have had an occasional thunder-squall with vivid lightning, in some measure clarifying the atmo- sphere, but we are sorry to say, accompanied by little or no rain, the want of which begins to be seriously felt What makes the heat still more intense, is that bush fires are raging on the mountains both east and west of the town. We trust a change may soon take place, or the vegetable kingdom - as far as Scone is concerned will be extinct. The fruit trees look pretty well, as also the vines , but the fruit will not be of much account, owing to ripening too fast - that is to say, it will be of no size. We need not mention the usual accompaniment of a continuance of such weather, such as flies, mosquitos, fleas, etc. As we write, an unpleasant and strong hot wind is blowing from the westward, covering the town Â«with a halo of smoke from the burning bush-fires. A great deal of sickness has been the consequence of such trying weather, more especially amongst children.
