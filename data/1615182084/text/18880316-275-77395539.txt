NOTES FROM BUSSELTON. (From our own Correspondent.) I notice that in setting my last letter you have made it appear, in referring to the death of Mr. Scott, that I sent you a telegram shortly before it took place. It should have been shortly after it took place ; it was also made to appear that Mr. T. Higgins shouted to his mother to look after tne sheep ; it should have read he shouted to his brother. The funeral of the unfor tunate man took place on Sunday after noon, and, as I anticipated in my last, was a very large one, over 200 following. Amongst the number I noticed our M.L.C. (Mr. Layman), Mr. Yelverton, the mem bers of the B.M.C., and a great many other leading men of the place. Flags were fly ing half-mast at the principal public places and at Mr. Holgate's, where the body lay. The church choir sang the the 286th Hymn A. & M. and the Rev. Mr. Clairs preached a funeral sermon in the evening. Mr. Clairs started on the Monday for a visit to the Warren, preaching at various homesteads on his way out and returning by another route, so as to visit the settlers on the Lower Blackwood; reaching Bus selton on Saturday afternoon in time for the meeting held in the Working Men's Hall. Thus he lost no time. In accordance with a notice posted up a meeting was held in the Working Men's Hall at 3 p.m. for the purpose of forming a committee to collect money and produce for the relief of the sufferers by the late disastrous floods at the Greenough. The Mayor (Mr. G. H. Knapton) having read the requisition asking him to convene the meeting the Rev. Mr. Clairs proposed and Dr. Lepper seconded the motion, ' that the Mayor retain the chair.' It was also pro posed and carried that the Rev. Mr. Clairs and Father Tracey act as secretaries ; also that the Resident Magistrate (Dr. Lepper) act as treasurer. Mr. Guerrier proposed and the meeting approved of the following persons acting on the committee to receive contributions :— Busselton : M. Lockhart, W. and J. Bovell, G. Cross, A. R. Pries, G. Rose. Wonnerup: G. Layman and Locke Brothers. Blackwood and Warren : E. R. Brockman and T. Dixson. New Town : T. A. Thurkle and E. Dawson. Quinda lup: H. J. Yelverton and J. Harwood. Augusta Sawmills : M. C. Davies. tt was decided to receive cash or produce of any kind. Mr. John Bovell suggested that all produce received be sold in the district — a suggestion that appeared to be approved of by the meeting. The Rev. Mr. Clairs then handed to the treasurer the following sums, collected by him upon his recent visit to the Warren and Lower Blackwood : R. Blythe, £1 ; W. Scott, £1 ; S. Longbottom, jr., 10s.; T. Longbottom, 10s. 6d.; T. Smith, 2s. 6d.; E. Brockman, £2; T. Dickson, £1; W. Longbottom, 10s.; C. Longbottom, 10s.; C. L. children, £1; total, £7 4s. Several others in the room also contributed. viz.. Dr. Lepper, £2 2s. ; Rev. Mr. Clairs, 10s. 6d. ; Mrs. Clairs, 5s. ; G F Guerrier, £1; G. H. Knayton, £1; A. R. Pries, 10s. 6d. ; W. R. P. Smith, 10s ; G. Rose, 10s. ; A. Cole, 5s. ;— making a grand total of £13 17s. Taking into consideration the fact that there were only eleven persons present the above speaks well for the commencement. It is a great pity that more persons did not show up, but I have no doubt that, when appealed to, many more will contribute freely. Those present were Dr. Lepper, R.M., Mr. G. Layman, M.L.C., Rev. Mr. Clairs, Messrs. Guerrier, G. H. Knapton, John Bovell, T. A Thurkle, G. Rose, W. R. P. Smith, A. R. Pries, and A. Cole. After a vote of thanks to the Mayor tor presiding and wish ing the committee success the meeting broke up. It may be worth while mentioning that the treasurer (Dr. Lepper) requests that all monies be paid to him, at his office. Mr. John Bovell has disposed of his racer 'Paddy' to Mr. Sholl, at a fair price. Messrs. Locke have also disposed of their mare ' Grace Darling.' Except at the Hamelin and Borannup mills the timber trade is not very brisk. Mr. Yelverton is only just keeping his works going ; the ' Ballarat ' being dor mant at present. As a proof of the scarcity of work I saw a poor man, his wife and a little boy tramping to the Augusta mills the other day in searoh of work, and the man assured me they had walked all the way from Perth. Tho weather is seasonable, Bush-fires are numerous. Nearly all, if not quite all, of our visitors from the Swan have returned to their homes. March 3.
