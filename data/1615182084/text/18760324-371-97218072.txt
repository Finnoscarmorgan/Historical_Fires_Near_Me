Original Poetry. THE HILLS OF AUSTRALIA. Oh! tall and barren rising With rugged rocks and high, While bush-fires burn thy verdure And kings of forests die. All burnt, and bare, and ragged, Ah! where is nature's grace? There are the ugly barren hills, But of verdure not a trace. Eiko' to* sbnie1 Barren' desert, With1 hot ground scorched and bare, While dust andibutnt-up cinders Are flying'- throcgh the air, While blackened- stumps up-rising; AÂ¥e' dotted'- o'er'the ground, And- little heaps of rabbish lAe smouldering on each mound; The *a.lleyH wild with gumtrees, With* 8ereeching 'posBumff-teem;.

And. scaly lizards creep about, And slimy serpents siide.- Witli music on;tne mountains; From5 a- thousand parrots's throats. Which pierce your ears/and deafen you Wtth their wild unearthly- notes ; And scattered round -in* drowsy groups, Bedaubed with* Stockholm tar, Are mournful7 'janlbueks'' bleating With- incessant doleful baa! And dab and mortar homesteads Areperchedo'er hill and plain; And grunting pigs and cackling hens* Made the echoes ring again ; Ana children's noisy clatter, And mother's shriller tone; Ptai o'er the hills of Austral* These are the gems ye owns ^aesett Town, 18th Maren- 1576;
