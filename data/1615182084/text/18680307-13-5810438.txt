Tire name of Mr. C. B. Galvin,.tvbo was a passenger by tho Omeo on heríate voyage from Now Zealand, was accidentally given as Glynn in tho publlshod passenger list WK are informed that tho names of Mr. Cook and MÍBS Victoire Cook wore accidentally omitted this morning, in tho report of tho arrival of tho steam- ship City of Melbourne. As a pendant to tho account in yesterday's paper of the trial trip to Queor^cllff of the new screw Bteamor John Penn, no add a few particulars porta'.nlng to matters practical, which bato their importance equally with those of a festivo character. Tho John Tenn is propelled by twin screws of eight feot pitch, which aro driven by two pairs of what aro known as Peim's horizontal direct-acting enginos. Theso aro of fifty-horso power nominal, but can bo worked up to tho high figure of 300 h.p.', and aro ' tho only engines of their description in theso waters. The average number of strokes per minute is 170, and the action is of such apparent rapidity as almost to induco tho belief that the engines would like to run away from tho yessol. Tho rato of speed attained on tho trial trip yesterday was vciy Batisfactoryi tho usual" testing dlstanoo be- tween the two lightships having boen accomplished In two hours and seton minutes, and this without any unduo pressure or oxtra consump- tion of fuel. In going and returning tho steamer w cut steadily and smoothly, and when at hor greatest Bpccd there was scarcely any vibration perceptible Being fitted with twin screws, tho John Penn is enabled to turo in hor own length, and two trials of her capability in this respect were made at Queens- cliff. In onelnstancesliestcamcd rlghtround In less than tlirco minutes, and in the other attempt she took about four minutes. It is anticipated, and notwithoutgood reason.lhat sho w ill bo able to maintain arate of speod of ten knots with tho small consumption of eight tons of coal per day. Tho entire machinory of this steamer is a niarvol of workmanship, as regards its finish and compactness, and adaptation for tho vessel. Tho de- partment is to be under tho control of Mr. Lambert, one of tho most tried and compotent engiueors from Messrs Ponn's celebrated establishment THE large ship Queen of the North, of the White Star line, arrived off Cape Otway on Monday night, from Liverpool, but by reason of contrary winds she did not anchor in the bay until yesterday, about mid- day. She is under the command of Captain Weaver, well known in this port while chief officer of the screw steamship Royal Standard, and has brought out on the present voyage 142 Government immigrants, 112 of whom are single females, selected by Miss Rye. These have all arrived in robust health, and the sanitary arrangements on board for the health and general welfare of the passengers were judicious and complete. High praise was also bestowed on Captain Weaver, Dr. Pringle Hughes, the surgeon in charge, and Miss Stainton, the matron, for efficiently fulfilling their several duties, and for greatly promoting the comfort of those under their supervision. An inspection of the 'tween-decks shewed that the greatest order and tidiness were everywhere apparent. The Queen of the North sailed from the Mersey on December 4, and met with favourable winds to the Canaries, which were passed on the eighth day out. The winds then fell light, and in the latitudes of both N.E. and S.E. trades were exceed- ingly scant. The equator was crossed on January 1, in long. 27deg. W., and the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope was passed on the 31st of the same month, in lat. 42deg. S. The ship ran down her easting between the parallels of lat. 43deg. and 44deg. until attaining the longitude of 90deg. E., when the winds, which had from the Cape to this point been chiefly from the W. and S.W., hauled into the N. and E., and Captain Weaver then ran as far south as lat. 50deg. In addition to the light weather which prevailed in the tropics, the passage was greatly retarded by a continuance of light easterly and northerly winds for the last twelve days. Not- withstanding her heavy cargo and large draught of water, the ship made some good sailing for several consecutive days in running down her longitude. She is consigned to Messrs. Lorimer, Marwood, and Rome, and will discharge her cargo at the Victorian Railway Pier. THE screw Bteamshlp City of Melbourne on hor present trip from Sydney brought on tho English and American mails and periodicals ox the Rakaia, from Panama; and on tho passago round sho mot with boautlf ul tt eather, and made an oxcollont run to Capo Howe ; on making tho Victorian coast, however, tho weather becamo oxtremoly foggy, and tho steamer had to alaeken speed. Wlion tho haze was at its densest, the engines, as a mailor of strict precaution, wero stopped for flvo hours and a half, and but for this untoward although prudent detention tilla fine steamship would havo nearly accomplished a forty- eight hours' passage The thick weather, Cap- tain Paddlo considers, was In a large measure at- tributable to extensive bush-fires along tho coast. TUB clipper barque Nightingale, of Messrs. Sponco Brothers and Co.'s licet, arrived in tho bay on Thurs- day night, in tow of tho steamor Titan. Sho left Ncwciistlo, N.S.W., on tho 27th ult, and had favour- able winds and weather throughout the passage. THE French barque Denis, which arrived at tho Heads from Calcutta in tho beginning of tho week, carno up the buy through tho night of Thursday, and was berthed }cstcrday morning alongside the Railway Pier, Sandridgo, to d'sehargo her cargo. Tho Donli , left Calcutta on January 11, and has made a very good patboge. Captain Do Court reports that Ho had light variable tt Inds on tho first part of the pass igo, and afterwards strong S.W. winds. Tho barquo brings a cargo of rico, co*tor oil, &c;, and is consigned to Mefsrs. F. W. Troll and Co. THE schooner Southern Cross arrived in tho bay yesterday, after a very good run round from Noiv castlo, N.S.W., to this port She left on tho 20th ult, and Captain M'Donald reports that ho had light variable winds, with thick hazy woather, nearly all the way. Ho olso reports having parted compiny, on Wednesday last, with the barquo Scoshcll, bound for Adelaide.
