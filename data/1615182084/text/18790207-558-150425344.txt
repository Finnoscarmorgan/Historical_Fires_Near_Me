EXCITING ESCAPE FROM A BUSH FIRE. The Cape Otway forest took fire on Wed nesday, and yesterday afternoon it assumed alarming proportions. The whole country, for miles, appeared to be one mass of flame, and every inflammable article in the track of the fire fell before the devouring element. Between Loutit Bay and Winchelsea the blaze was keenly felt. Cobb's coach, return ing from Loutit Bay, and containing as pas sengers a lady, a resident of Melbourne, and a boy, the son of Mr M'Kean, of the Water Supply Office here, had a very narrow escape from the flames. The fire raged furiously over a portion of Mr Hopkins' pastoral run, and extended across the road leading from Lorne. The driver of the coach, which was drawn by four horses, did not observe that the road was almost barricaded with a wall of fire until he had fairly driven into the centre of it. The coach was surrounded by the flames, and a sharp bend in the road pre vented the driver of the vehicle from turn ing about. Nothing was left but to face the burning mass. The lady and boy threw them selves on the floor of the coach, and wrapped rugs around their clothes, whilst the driver whipped the horses, causing them to gallop along the burning road for a distance of one mile, when passengers, coach, horses, and dri ver emerged from a cloud of smoke, and to all appearance a sheet of flame, very little the worse for the adventure. The passengers were, of course, a little frightened at the thought of being roasted to death, and the driver of the coach was much scorched about the face and hands. The coach, too, was slightly scorched, and the horses just a little bit singed. Credit is due to Cobb's driver for the plucky manner in which he met the difficulty. On getting out of danger the coach was stopped close to a gang of men under Mr Hopkins' charge, who were endea- voring to check the progress of the flames, and Mr Hopkins kindly showed every atten tion to the affrighted travellers.
