EEDBUTH! [Correspondent.] \- - ? . . Januarv 20. There is scarcely anything doing in the neighbour hood, except in the fire line. For two or three davs past there has been a bushfire in the neighbourhood of Booborowie, but I hear it has been put out. ? This morning about half-past 4 a fire was discovered at a side storeroom (a wooden shed) of Mr. John Richards' grocers' shop, Market-square, Kooringa. Mr. W. Chappen, who lives next door, was quickly on the spot, and by means of water soon extinguished tne aaines, out naa ne Deen-iu minutes-later -tbe are would have reached the roof of the main, store, which is connected with, several others, all of which would no doubt have been burned down. Great praise is due to Mr. Chiappell for his efforts. The fire originated with some old barrels and boxes outside the shed^and ran up the corner about six feet wide, then up the roof, and had reached within a foot or two of the roof of the store. ? The weather -continues warm. ? -? Another effort is being made at the mine to make low price ore. Two men have taken a bargain for three months at 10s. tribute' to raise the stufij which will be stamped instead of crushed as usual, and will be dressed differently to the present mode. It would prove a great .advantage if this, could, be .made to pay. ? ? , -
