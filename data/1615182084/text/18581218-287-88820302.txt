MACCLESFIELD. (From a Correspondent.] December 14. ; Since my last, the road through the township has been almost finished, but great dissatisfaction has been ex pressed in consequence of its not having been laid out udiciously. ; There is a place alongside a swamp, and another near the Schoolhoase, where the water will overflow the road for want of a culvert to lead it off. This water will of necessity become stagnant, and subject the inhabitants to much annoyance. For the sake of the Dublin health, it is to be honwl that the -District Council will interfere in the matter without delay, and thus prevent the baneful -consequences which must arise if the unsanitary nuisance is permitted to exist The road is so narrow that it is with difficulty that two drays can pass each other. The work, so far as the contractor is concerned, is satisfactory. Harvest is near, at hand. - All the hay crops are secured. The crops in general will be very light. The heat is just now intense. A good many bush-fires. are observable. . . . At this season of the year tbe utmost care is required in everything -calculated to ignite the dry grass. . A singular case occurred the other day in my garden. Some old cabbage plants, covered with blight, were visited by an insect called, I believe, the ladybird. The ladybird's mission seems to be the destruction of the aphis. He . fulfilled it' rapidly and welL Several persons werj: witnesses of what took place. ! ;. Thursday, the 16th instant, is fixed as the day for taking Into consideration the desirability of establishing a Mechanics' ?Institute.
