PREVENTION OF BUSH FIRES. It would not entail much trouble or expense if applied ait the proper season of the year, to inake; ample provision against the advance '.of bush fire. Around every homestead, around every reasonably sized grass' phddock and along al main roads, what iare termed ' fire-breaks" might easily and cheaply be prepared at each! summer's ap proaclh. The 'best,* cheapest' and quickest method of 'preparing'" fir&. breaks" is by burning. strips of grass fiont one to three chains in width (the wider the;better.. in, timbered country) along biuondimiy fences and main roads and around stacks and homesteads. "In the early days this work was reguilarly, attended to ini miafiny districts, par ticularly upon open plains. As sun mer approached neighboring. farmmers and their sons would meet? en ap pb iited inights suitable for bhurning strips, :and .forming themselves into gangs i;qotld.: prepare miles and miles of these, " breaks."
