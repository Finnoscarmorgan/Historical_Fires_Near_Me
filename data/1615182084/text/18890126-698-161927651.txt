Carcoar. January 19. On Saturday last, the 12th instant, a very serious and extensive fire occurred at Fernside, 12 miles from here. Over 1200 acres .of splendid grass, besides a large quantity of fencing, were totally consumed. Many men laboured with great zeal and energy, to extinguish the flames, but through the high wind that prevailed their efforts were utterly fruitless. Several residents on Snnduy had a narrow escape from being victims to tbe burning element. The fire ran with such rapidity that they had to gallop away as fast as their horses could carry them. The damage that Mr. Cobb and his neighbours has sustained this season throueh bush-fires is very considerable. As a rule, bush-fires occur through carelessness or spite and malice. Tho originators of them ought to be severely punished, but the difficulty is to prove the crime. More stringent laws are required. The election for two aldermen will shortly take place in the rooiii of Mr. J. .0. Dodd (Mayor) and Mr, Alfred Tucker, whose term has expired. It is not thought that the latter will again come forward. Messrs. J. A. Moss, Hector Lamond, and lienry Russell will run for the second seat, as the Mayor's election is certain. I have not heard of any other likely candidates. It is the general 0piniuu that Mr. Moss stands the best chance. He has been a resident for many years, and takes an interest in the welfare of the town, does a good business, and is charitable in the extreme. ?
