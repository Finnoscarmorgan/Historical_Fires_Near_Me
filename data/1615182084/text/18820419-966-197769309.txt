THE TEMORA GOLD-FIELDS. [ By Telegraph. ] Temora, April 18. Last night a magnificent sight was visible in the heavens. At about 8 o'clock in the south-east there was seen a brilliant light, as from a large bush-fire, the country in that quarter being apparently all in a blaze, gradually the light from a deep red began to pale, and from it shot up, as it were, huge mountains of light, changing into the most beautiful colours This wonderful sight was then found to be the Aurora Australis, and it quickly disappeared to the north-west and back again to the south-east. It lasted for some time and created quite a sensation. The other parts of the heavens were quite arctic in appearance, the stars shining with intense brilliancy, and the sky a deep blue. Afterwards the night was extremely cold, and towards morning almost freezing. The whole of the Melbourne Company's Nil Desperandnm property at Possum Power is advertised for sale by the bailiff on Thursday next. Ever since this Company was formed it has been sadly mismanaged, which is the cause of the present unfortunate catas- trophe. Sykes and party washed at South Aus- tralian Puddling Company 565 loads, which averaged 14 dwt. per load. The water in the Company's shafts is sufficient for 500 loads per week. Messrs. Solomon & Hunter, the purchasers of Jackson's property, proceed to-morrow to Barmedman to inspect it.
