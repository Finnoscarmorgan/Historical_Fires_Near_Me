YORK, February 21. The weather is still excessively hot. Al though the cmet — said always to be true harbinger of high temper ature — has disappeared we seem to b. living in a cauldron. It is indeed well that we have civilized the natives and somewhat refined their tastes, otherwise we should be iu tine condition tor mastication at a grand corrob-wee. Bush-fires are raging in various directions, and I have just heard that Mr. Win. Shaddk-k, jun., is com pletely burnt out — house, 6tores, out houses, and every tiling, excepting a reapin * machine ; his father aad surroundiag neighbors suffering severely in the shape of burnt fences. — A poor, but very respectable v:,ung man, named Henry Williams, who inline out in the ' Yarra ' on her late trip here from England as a passenger, was found dead in the bush some few days ba'.-k by a farmer named Chas. Hicks, who gave inf oruiatir -n to the police. The unfortunate man was sitting by the side of a back road near Northam, about two ciilesfrom wator. Ho had money in his pocket, so that there appears to have been no foul play to cause death. He was out gum-gathering. At the inquest I hear the verdict was ' Died from exhaustion.' — Notwithstanding the intensely hot weather people are ' marrying and giving in marriage,' and so I suppose it will ever be — bad times or good times. We have had no less than two wed'lings this week — jne in hijfh lif-', tho other in humble life ; but I will refrain from mentioning names, as you are pretty certain *-..- receive notification of these happy unions in due course.* — Wheat, 4s. per bushel.
