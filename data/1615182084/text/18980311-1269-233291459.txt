Tasmania's Minimum Wage. Says the Sydney BULLETIN :— The minimum-wage question has never yet struck Tasmania, but the maximum wage in that lovely land of Dreams is fixed by the Chief Justice. As thus: The C.J., as chairman of the Bush-fires Belief Committee and Lord High Apportioner of the publicly-subscribed funds, lately ukased that four shillings a day is to be the maximum wage for those burnt out settlers and others who may be employed re-building fences and houses in the fire-devastated districts. But as the Government employes in some of those districts—road repairers, bridge men, &c.;—were being paid at the rate of six shillings a day, some dissatisfacion naturally ensued. Quote:— Bepresentations were, however, made to the Minister of Lands and Works upon the point, and Mr Pillinger at once gave instructions to have a proper rate resorted to by the Officers of the department under his charge.' That the Van Dobson, whose own minimum-wage is fixed by Act of Parliament at about £4 a day, should consider four shillings a day a" proper '' maximum for Bill Smith, is probably what Bill Smith expected and deserved ; but that Jim and Joe, and all the other six-bob-a-day chaps in bluchers boots would be sweated a third of their munificent salaries in the sacred cause of Charity, not even a burnt-out Bill Smith would have considered probable. Yet if Bill had brains as well as, or in lieu there of, bluchers, he would note that a third of the C. J.'s screw is £500, and that £10 is all that appears in the published list as the measure of his sacrifice. But the beauties of private charity are lost on the average person who sweats and wears bluchers, and it isn't much use preaching at him yet. For the present, we can find food for thought in noting how the Shadow of the Old Regime clings to Tasmania under the Van Dobson ditto.
