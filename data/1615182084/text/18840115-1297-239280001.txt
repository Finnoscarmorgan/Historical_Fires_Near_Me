THE DROUGHT IN QUEENSLAND. A correspondent of tbe Brisbane Courier writes: — " Ikat the drought iB Bore in the land is a fact that needs no telling, and tbo question of tbe moment is, 1 Will the mouth of February como to our rescue in tbo matter of rain i' It has never failed ua eincc LS51, but it looks very doubtful now, for there nre some more than ordinary weather influences at work this season. We bad our disastrous droughts in 1SG2 and 1SG9 and 1877, but tbo month of February invariably mado- up for it all ; and wo have to go back to 1851 for an instance ol' failure of rain iu that month. Tbo river Brisbane has lately, or novor, been so salt for thirty years as now. It is at present a mere arm of the sea, and its bunks, oven above the bridge, now reveal swarms of sea crub, that usually do not affect fresh water at all. The sea now supplies all, or nearly all, of the water in tbo river, for the beautiful fresh stream — which, in ordinary seasons, is a succession of deep clear pools, rusbing pebbly pure reaches and pretty cas cades, fringed with willow and melateuca trees, all the way from .Wivcnhoe up to Oolinton, and Taromeo — has ceased to run, or contribute materially to what wo call tbo River Brisbano. The equatorial gules (spoken of in a recent issuo) havo done tlioir work most effectually in the vicinity of Goulbunr, Now ,South Wales, this Christmas in tho bush-fire lino. It is to bo hoped we shall not have to go back to tho fearful historical drought years of IS2G, 1838, and 1860, to parallel tho present visitation, and that measures will bo taken to render such natural phenomena loss hurtful infature by irriga tion and the conservation of water at high levels, a 'very payable method of investing capital in India ond America, One evil effect of the present drought lies in tbe extent to which tbe uir we breatho is loaded with comminuted par ticles of duBt, which cause in some constitu tions bronchial complications, nnd BymptomB of the same, when no actual cald has been caught, tho same as during the " whiffles" or hay lever, of tho dry harvest Beason in England ; there appears to be some phenomenal, oven if only temporary, alteration in the structure of the sun itself at the present time ; for, in no other way can we account for that extraordinary lurid after glow following tbe sunset, and which, in its msgenta and cinnamon hues, throws over' tho west sky and over tho west face of all houses, &o.;, a reflection as of some vast fire. Now tliis glow is never seen , excopt just aftor sundown, or in n lossdcgreo, at the same interval of time before sunrise, thereby proving that tho direct rays from tho sun must strike tho circumferonco of tho earth at n certain nnd unvarying tangent, or line of soction in ordor to throw up this effect on tho part of the earth, which has just before lost tho last level r >y of the sun, Nothing in the earth, or of the earth, or from the earth, could causo this "eerie" sight to appear witb such remarkable precision and at a certain time only. Tbe reason must bo in the sun itself, the great governing power of our weatber, magnetism, electricity, and rainfall, If February fails us, Match and. April may be more merciful, but failing then, wo can rely on no oiber mouth for rain, though Mho unexpected' doss often happen in this life," j
