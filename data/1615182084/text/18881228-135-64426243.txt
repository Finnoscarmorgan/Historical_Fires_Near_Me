JE1?ALING. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) December 27. The old saw-" 'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody any good," is exemplified this season with us, the extreme drought over other parts of the colony rendering it necessary for the stock holders to part with their stock at ridiculously low figures, while those who are living in the hilly por tions of South Gippsland may con tinue buying and iattening all through the summer months. In this parish I have not yet heard one individual com plain of the scarcity of either grass or water, therefore we may consider our selves, for this season at least, a well favoured people. The storm which passed over here on the 18th inst. had the desirable effect of extinguishing the bushfires in the neighbourhood, and once more the district is free from that never failing summer accompanyist. Christmas Day has passed, and we have all had the pleasure of giving and receiving our various tokens of peace and goodwill. Talking of peace and goodwill, one would think there was a battle raging in the vicinity. There have been con tinuous reports of firearms all round during the holidays just past. This is occasioned by the city sportsmen who come to visit us, but not being able to distinguish good sport from indifferent, have been wasting a lot of valuable ammunition on the skins of the native bears, who, no doubt, calmly sit and watch, wondering when the sportsmen will learn~not to be tickling them with shot when they want to sleep. The diamond drill is still working in the district, but as yet no payable seam of coal has been struck, still we wait patiently for future developments, and trust that the machine will yet pierce something good. The fruit crops promise to yield re markably well, being quite free, so far, from the destruction so frequently caused by visitations from parrots and the like. Those of our residents who have trees in quantity will realise good profits from their orchards.
