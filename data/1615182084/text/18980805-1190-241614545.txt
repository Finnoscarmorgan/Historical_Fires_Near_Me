BUSHFIRES IN GIPPSLAND MR LONGSTAFFS PICTURE. PROPOSED PURCHASE FOR THE NATIONAL GALLERY. Mr John LongstalT's magnlficent and highly dramatic picture, depicting bush fires in Gippsland, at the Old Court Gal lery, has created quite a furore amongst vlsltors, and we hear on good authority that some pressure is likely to be brought to bear on the Govern ment to purchase it for the National Gallery. The critics have bestowed much praise on the work, and the ar tist's unconventional and realistic treatment of the subject, and admirers of art have expressed the opinion that It will be a pity if the National Gallery trustees let the opportunity pass with- out- making a special recommendation to.the Chief Secretary to secure the pic ture. No doubt, as Mr Longstaff's boy- hood was associated with Clunes. the Chief Secretary's interest could be arous- ed in more than an ordinary degree. At any rate, as we have stated, there is a movement on foot to influence Ministers, and the trustees of the National Gallery ought to wake up in order to be able to advlse the Cabinet when asked on the merits of the picture.
