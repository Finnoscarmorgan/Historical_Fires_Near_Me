THE FIRES IN GIPPSLAND STILL RAGING. WARRAGUL, Tuesday. The arrival of another heat wave has re newed all our alarms. All last night the sur rounding country was lighted up by bushfires, which illuminated the sky in all directions. Away over on the Strezlecki ranges and to the south of Warragul, where are sitnated the dairying settlements of Seaview, Fern dale, Strezlecki, and Allambee, the con flagration seemed to be fiercest, and every few minutes the illumination wonld be intensified by the simultaneous fall ing of huge giants of the forest, sending up brilliant showers of sparks and embers, which, had the effect of lighting up the country for miles round. The news from that district is anxiously awaited to-day, as it is believed there must be much damage done. The fires at Bloomfieldâ€™ are also making rapid progress, and although no serious damage is as yet reported, great anxiety prevails in consequence of the wind, whioh is blowing fresh, having veered round to the north-east, thus threatening the splendid farms and homesteads of Messrs Lillico, Moffat, Korner, and others. Dense smoke is again rolling over the town ship, obscuring the landscape. If we do not get rain, another spell of heat means renewed bush fires and more disaster.
