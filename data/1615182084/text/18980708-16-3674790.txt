THE OUTLOOK OF VICTORIA. The closing of the nnancial year has furnished evidence bearing on the posi- tion and prospects of the seven colonies of Australasia so far ns these are repre- sented or indicated by the figures of public finance. Broadly the informa- tion is of au encouraging nature. Many years have passed since the story of the State balance-sheets was as satis- factory as the one just published. It is as clear as the fact can be made that Australasia has got through the worst phases of the industrial aud com- mercial troubles. It is equally clear that the Governments have learned how to control the public finances. Re- covery from past disasters and new developments of the kind whicli can be called progress are slow in the eyes of men who participated in the excite- ments and imaginary gains of the boom years, but we may well be thankful to get them anyhow. Australasia is ou the up-grade again, and if the lessons of the past should so far be taken to heart as to prevent excessive indulgence in speculation we may confidently look for sound and steady progress. The prosperity which is being built up now is not a flimsy thing that can easily be blown away. It is the result of in- telligently controlled industry. It is solid. One colony which has suffered heavilj' deserves special congratulation upon the unmistakable improvement in the general aspect of its affairs. Of all tlie continental colonies Victoria had to pass through the fiercest fires of adversity. She had 'transgressed econ- omic law with the most daring reckless- ness, and the penalty was inescapable. But Victoria is still a great province of Australia. Let us not forget that she 'has held a remarkable relation to the other colonies. There is not one of them-not even rich New" South Wales or distant New Zealand-that has not been largely indebted, to Victoria .for assistance in developing resources. Vic- torian capital and energy have been beneficially felt throughout Australasia. And if all of us have not a sympathetic feeling for the brave colony which has battled with so much trouble we are deficient in gratitude as well as in the faculty of admiration. We ought to rejoice with Victoria now thal she is finding her way back into the sunshine. The mere figures of her public finance are powerfully suggestive of the dis- cipline ,she has endured and survived. Look at them : Year. Revenufe. Expenditure. 1889-90 .£8,519,000 £9,045,000 1890-91 . 8,343,000 9,128,000 1891-92 . 7,729,000 8,482,000 1892-93. 6,900,000 7,989,000 1893-94 ,. 6,710,000 7,310,000 1894-95 .%.. 6,712,000 6,760,000 1895-96 . 6,458,000 6,535,000 1896-97. 6,629,000 6,575,000 1897-98 . 6,886,000 »6,636,000 * Estimated. "Ihe tide has at last turned. There is an improving revenue and a firmly regulated expenditure. In this connec- tion Sir George Turner 'has won un- dying distinction. But the accumulated deficits of the bad years 'amount to more than three millions sterling. Pro- bably as in Queensland they will be quietly incorporated with the general debt. It is a great thing to report an increase of a quarter of a million for the year just ended, and of over four hundred thousands for the two years. Surely the colony is really round the corner. Sir George Turner got last year more than eigbty thousand pound.'* above his estimate, but t'his is ex- plained by extraordinary and unantici- pated receipts from probate dutjfcs. Still the main fact is that the revenue advanced materially, and that there is. a good surplus over expenditure,, and this although an unusually bad, season, affected some of the sources, of income, and there were special changes upon the Treasury, sudh as the F/t_eral Conven- tion and referendum, v/oâ drought and bush-fire relief me._sures. Now the outlook is exeellen " The season is as unusually good af¿ tuat of last year was unusually bad., Both pastoral and agricultural ir^jitstries are expected to make a big output, gold raining is in a healthy condition, and business keeps pacet with the growth in the other spheres of activity. We repeat that Auafcralia at large can offer Vic- toria the 'heartiest congratulations upon her indisputably improved, position and brightening prospect».
