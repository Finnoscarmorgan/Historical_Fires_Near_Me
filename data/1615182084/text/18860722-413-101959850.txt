,, dTEilS" ;OF : ! I The weather during the, present wcckihak been in oat Spring-like and genial. Early oil last Tuesday morning rain again set in, and a- hqiiyy: shower: or two' fell,\regi8termg,25 points, making a total of about half an inch since Monday. The result is that the sui{» ahiue which 1ms followed, has caused the grass' to ^spring vigorously, and tlie whole aspect of the couutry, especially outside the town, is, travellers assure us, Going rapidly changed. A mketi^o of the Fire Brigades Board was held at the Board's office last evening, when there were present the Chairman (Mr. H. Hayes, Mayor), and Messrs. G. Slieppard, A. T. Bolton, and Uie Secretary, Mr. H. 'AV. Williams.. A quantity of formal business was transacted, and arrangements were made for.periodical inspections of ,the Permauent Fire'Brigade. . , { Lv another column will, he fouud the pro gramme of, the.first meeting of the jWag^a Amateur Kacing Club, to be hohieu on Wed nesday, the 25th of next month. As a first effort of ,tlie Club, the stakes offered aro ex ceedingly liberal, and it is to be' hoped that* the patronage of the sportiug public will be correspondingly so. The names of the officers of the Club give assurance thatevery thing will bo carried out in a thoroughly perfect manner, and we shall be surprised if there is not u goodly list of entries for each event.' As a rule au amateur race meeting is a most enjoyable oue, partaking more of .the nature of a family party or picnic thau does a formal race meeting, and,as a rule, . the ;ladies arc most, liberal in their attend ance.upon such occasions. As there is a "bracelet" to,)»e,ruu for, no,-.doubt the initial meeting..of, the pew, club, will fully susiaiu. the]'desirable preseucq;,we liaye,pre ferred to, , The. entries w»U. close..on the ,17th, and the. weights >vill be published,,on : tlie 21st August. : , j ; In the L-gislutivc Assembly* on Tuesday last, Mr. Uorinly asked the .Postmaster General*—" Will he make inquiries, for the purpose of ascertaining if it is desirable to provide additional accommodation for the Post ana I'eiegrapn, . Departments, at Wagga Wagga iSutt'or' auawerecl,—" If the -Honorable Member will refer to a letter of the' 2lst January, from my Department, he will see tliat it'.has.been decided to erect anew building for.thePost Olfice at VVagga Wagga. I'have'- acoertaincrt from the Colonial Archi tect that plans are now ready, aud specifica tions are; being .prepared, and . will be com pleted in .about three weeks time, when tenders will be iuvited; The cost'is not to exceed the , vote t of £3000. ,Is is inteuded, on completion of . the new building, to use the present.ope for;.telegrapic^purposee." It is almost needless to remind our readers tlmt the Oddfellows' Ball takes place this evening in the Fretmasons' Hall. All who ate goiu^, especially the ladies, know all about it, andthere has beou a flutter of ex citement in scorcs of households during the last weeK or two. The affair promises to be1 an umjualified success, and, as the'weather, is'geaiaJ, it is to be hoped that visitors re-; siding a few miles outside the townwill not he deterred from coming in. It will be seen by an advertisement elsewhere, that the dress circle will be open to visitors at 2s. Gd. per lieacl.* • f ^Yestbrdav/ Messrs. T.:' Edmoudsau-'and Co. (by their Mr. C. H.

One of th" most impor tant features of the Company's operations;1 sofavasresidcntsinithisdiptrictare concerned, is .the ^announcement .referring to the insurance upon wool "from: tho sheep's back-" to port of ahipmeut."

Tho succeeding fareo of "The Silent' Womau" refreshingly removed; the dismal feeling the. lirst piece, iu which all the other characters were fairly sustained, had caused) and everybody went away well pleased.,.:- Last evening tho drama of "Tho, Woman of the People" was played, arid here again Miss Viviau, who is . essentially auv emotional actress, in the character of the distracted wife, preached a lesson against di uukenness more powerful than wo have ever heard, from pulpit or lecture platform. There ik nothing repulsive in the piece, excepting the couduct of the husband, a dissolute fellow 14 on strike," who actually pawns the last garments of his wife to gratify his thirst for drink. Louise Buudot, in Sydney, was a powerful exponent of tho character of tho, much*tried woman, but Miss Vivian, in several respects, was superior to her. Of course the husband reforms, and happiness is restored to.tho almost ruined homo, and the curtain falls unon a 'dmommi'.nt wlrinti given hopes for the future happiness of the. family.
