At tbVtiche the gwss is »lrv as welt as luing it will b'e useleas purtinsr -htfep on. they will tread it down without eating it; A mutual prttrtJtion coin pan v is the safest Vem«*dy of all-^-a company or comjwniw (F6r 1 a lVo&te; the establishment of two or three) professing to insure not tmly the crefps. but stock, bu'fdmgs, feUues, an-t eVerytboiir else fonnd on a farmer's premises. No one profession has so little ph-tectiou Ironi fire as the tWrmer. No one toeeds more ; but certainU lao cIh^i tia^ shown less anxiety t-- create a syeteth of mutual pro tection than they have. 1 know that moat frisU'an'ee companies object to enter tain rural risks, and stringent conditions are insisted Upon ; but there is no necessity for these conditions to be prohibitory, as they Lave been hitherto. Let the farmers j have their »frn insurance companies. Let all have an interest, not only in their own propeTJrt'es, but in their neigli hours*. In many localities the farmers before harvest ' agree anting themselves that upon the first alarm of fire 8sy and every hand ' shall he knocked off work, and all their] energi-a conomtra'sd to extinguish the fire; hut this energy would he dfeplayed' ia a greater degree if tbe owner of the 3 property being destroyed and his teigh* j b-xirs asking in the pieveutton of vs i destructtoa had au interest -u~tbe Same insurance company. Pii-ea may be traced to acts of carelessness mote than to any. othei ca(u& But lows can be made to v-'O- r*' - J*rft!0l cases w* long l^feai taws witt be fount waees* irai-y for itavine this csirefess use of firwby , smokers, teamsters, and swagsmen. ft®is -' almost R? culpable to ligbt a pipe^in a fcarvett 'field as in a powder raig^txiUe, ^nd it Is a good farmers adopt of not ano#iiI|£ : : between the - meals, er mivwherebuf^nthehut^ Snme appreciate their nnn-8moking labourers so m»Yoh as to allow them tegrher wages than tho«e that 8in-»ke. As onr number - of farmers iricrease we imagine, the: dinger from fires will decrease, from several rea« sons* among other thin/s, more etrips of green fodder wiU be purposely grown j paddoplcs of English grasses Hrdi gre itly on the increase, and they will play their part as partial stoppages.. Again, the population is increasing, and at* area of agricultural land has now four' or five tune? its number of occupiers, and we may add guardians. Another T**a8on Wbv tbe daniage in ifhtrne will be lessened is, ii two or three insnnmce com^niei be fanned, and the mHjority of .tajmers be com s sharehol ders, there wiH lje^a better Vufservision treneraily - in the country 4i* tricts.

' Agricultural property has been nsuaSly looked upon by tbe insurance .eQzmtimfl**' aa too 'risky.' Indeed, until --recently, only one company xiid bOsine^s iu tmr branch of insurance ; btit with istring^ii conditicala attached to the pbliciee, r higher irate of prexfiiam, genera: desire to inaiure creiatea mromfhoa^ th^ farming comtnu'nityV it 'Svould b^ fbond be a far more profitable bftftteh of tnsu nnce than many others^ THece is little likelihood of deception ra caae^ pt ppo* paBals for insuring. The ittiide of a stack can be examined as %oTely iu a house. The etandilSg -cropa imd fert^i are before the agent Veres, An da ce^C «ite froni a -3 unified ^ vet.' ,woiFa b« satisfactory so far as regards the h6alth of stock. And locking ait the Value of our agricultural produce ^nd:itock in the aggregate, and the ifisigiu&cant; per centage destroyed by fire, or taken of by disease during the year, I must express my suirprise that t^is channel- tor enfce prise and capital, has been so lortg neglected. There Is abundant room for two or three companies to operate ; ia fact, it would be imprudent and 'very bad policy for only one company to take all the risks of Ah iagrieult^rri district. Much would have to depend' Upon the Judgment of the . local agent or sur veyor ; an»? certain conditions imposed and insisted 'upon, conditions simple in themselves, and VrMeh a great manyjfarmera comply with even without undertahiiig to do -eo to a :^ompa ny^ aachK as hot permitting niore ihah two stacks to be built in close proximity to each other; staeks not to be -Within so many yards of a public road; stae'ea to be plongbed round at such a distance and at fe *ta£ed breadth; a atrip cf land ploughed or a certain width of road to be between tho cultivated land or stackyard and dwelling bouse ; no stcain thrasher to be used without having sufficient spark-catcher atta»had; no smoking aU lowed in the stackyard or pad locks. All the above conditions are now bainj c 'tried out by scores of our farmers, whose stock and stacks are as safe to insure as almost any town .properties. It rests with tbe farmers themselves in a threat measure to secure this '? protec tion '' to themselves and families. It is not too late even this season for tbem to t&e; at Once active 8teps, and either encourage £ny company zdneady willing lo receive proposals for Tusu^ance, or set afloat one company Or more for their own special .protection. This season is a plentiful one, and every agriculturist and istockowner ought to-aet aside Bay 10 per cent, of his amount of capital for purchasing shafts in Bome Farmers* Insurance Company. This state of things must aseureuly come 'to pass, and that Soon, and those who arer first in tbe field with tact and ?spita!,:wiil be the first to reap the benefit. Lot a farmer bear in mind that the protection for the produce of 100 acres may be obtained off' about one acre or a trifle more, and surely Do m^ who values the interests of hia family, aa well aa freedom from anxiety on bis own part, will hesitate to iftfcure them as so small a cost.-^iai&to.; ifirww*.
