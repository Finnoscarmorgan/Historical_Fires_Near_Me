VIOl'Ot√≠lA BLAIN NOTES. UNDER date January 11th 'our Victoria Plains correspondent writes :-" The old year went out and the new caine in during the hotest weather we have ex- perienced for some time, the thermometer going up to 112 iu the shade, and as if tiie natural heat was not sufficient there were bushfires in varisus directions to add toit. At the meeting of thc Roads Board, for election of members, held on the 31st ult., not a single ratepayer attended, exceptiug the members of tko Board and the supervisor, thus showing the little interest taken in the proceed- ings by the general public. A larmer na-.ned Byrue, residing near Bindoon, narrowly escaped losiug all his crops by fire last week. The fire started in a heap of straw in the yard, but was fortunately prevented from spreading to the stacks, only destroying the threshed 6traw and sume fencing. It is supposed that some matches must have been dropped in thc straw and by some means got ignited. A lad named Butler got hts leg broken a short time ago by a fall from a horse. By last accounts ho was progressing favourably. Tho child reported iu my last as having been injured hy lightning bas quite recovered. People are begin- ning to talk about tho forthcoming races. I hear that they are to take place on the 4th March, and that an excellent pro- gramme has been arranged and will be Advertised Shortly., v A novelty: this year,. \- . --- will be a race for a gold bracelet, the horses to be nominated by ladies. The rainfall for December was .72 inches, making a total for the year of 18.12 inches, against 16.27 inches in 1884."
