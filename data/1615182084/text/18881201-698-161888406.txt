Wiseman's Ferry. fFROH OUK COBREfiPONDBNT.) November 26. Since my last report, as regarding the prospects of the farmers and fruitgrowers in this district (some six weeks ago), things have changed very much for the worse. The drought, which we considered broken up, haB set in again with redoubled force ; and bush-fires, which we- considered a thing of the past, have been raging for the past few weeks with greater fury than ever— in fact, to such an extent that considerable damage was done to fences, par ticularly near Dural. This is a great hardship for travelling stock, as hardly a blade of grass may be seen for miles alonfc the Great Northern Boad; and the pad docks along the river bants are also very bare of herbage. The want or rain Is very much felt, the growth of vegeta tion having almost come to a standstill, and the watcrholes being dry, or nearly so. If we aTe not favoured with some good heavy showers, or a couple of days' nice steady rain, between this and Christmas, the standing crops will be light indeed ; as it is, there will be scarcely any green stuff fit to be turned into hay, the stalks in many places not being above one foot or 18 inches high. Shipments of odd cases of early summer ftuit have commpncea, apricots command ing as high a figure as £4 per case. This kind of fruit early apncot— is very scarce, as the 6evere gales some time back thinned these trees to a great extent.
