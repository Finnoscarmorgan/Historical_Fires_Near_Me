TN PARLIAMENT. -«1 A gravo matter of pnvilogo wa* brought before the .Assembly whoa it met At least, Mr Neild appeared to think tho matter one of portentous solemnity, although Iho J Io UPO declined to regaid it m this staggering light It Bccins that a select committee had been treated with calm contempt hy some witnCUBOS, and Mr Neild thought it only right that the Ilouse should know all about it, BO an to bo in a position to deal with tho offenders Visions of tho Clock Tow or (tho fact that thero is no Oïock Tower cannot affect a vision) and Sergeant-at-ArinH were at onco con- jured up Tlio Holeot committee in question is tho ono appointed to inquire into the refusal of tho Public Service Board to grant certain pensions to dismissed publie officers , and tho breach of pri \ llego consisted of tlio refusal of Messrs Powell and Holhraiu, of tho board, to answer some questions that had boon put *o them hy tho committee Thoy wero pressed to do BO, and Standing Orders of tho Houso wero read to them, but with i no -"fleet Thoy replied in effect that they WDuld seo the committee a "Royal Commission boforo ti ey did so, aud Mr Powell expressed his determination of being sent to Dar- linghurst rather than answer At this point Mr Held expressed the wish that thero were moro Omi I servants of this Roman typo, and by various interjections seomed to highly approve the stand of tho gontlemen in question Mr Noild viewed the I attitude with pain and surprise Nevertheless ho i dcolmed to bo turned nsido from the dtehargo of a stem duty Ile dilated on tho attitude of these re\olutiomst witnesses, how, m fact, with tlio utmost violenco of manner and gesture ono had flouted lus questioners Tho solemn reading of tho 7th section of tho Parliamentary Evidonce Act to him had been without oifoot It seemed incredible that ono man should have BO much audacity At this state it w as thoughtfully remembered that Mr Neild was out of order, as he was not prepared to make any motion The honourable and gallant member wished to throw tho duty of reproving the witnesses on tho Spcakei , but Sir Joseph Abbott declined the in- tended courtesy Ile would havo nothing to do with it, and the whola matter disappeared Beforo this came on Mr Reid an- nounced that ho had no intention of going on with tho city railway project this session Tie also informed tho House that provision bad been made on tho LHÍ lmatts for the Mounted Rifles, and ho had heard nothing about a Goverument cheque bcinir dishonoured Tho International Patents and Trodo Marks Arrangements Bill was reid the third time A great national question in tho shapo of tho Natue riora Protection Bill was brought on next This mensuro belongs to that unostentatious but vitally important class of laws which may be described as ** domestic *' Tho object of the bill has been somewhat modified since it was lust boforo tho ÏÏouso , it refers to some 11 species of wild flowers, and applies only to Crown lands The species are nativo ruse, pinnate leaved boronia, native fuchsia, waratah, and a lot of others The bill fixed the penalty for offending agambt the Uw at £o Noarly everyone objected to this amount, except Dr Ross Tho member for Molong thought that Mr Parnell, the author of tho bul, was entitled to the cnthusastic thanks of the whole couutrj lie dcstribed the desperidoes who pluokcd wild flowers-wo all know them, thoso crime stained malefactors of throo or four, pursuing their hideous work m bibs and pinafores-in tho most scathing terms aud ho asked, with tremendous point, why people should not go on tho land and cultívate it, and then if the) wished to pluck wild flowers tho) coull grow them Tho bill was objected tons being unnecessary It waa aigued that tho nativo flowers of tho colon) were practically inexhaustible, and no harm was done by allowing children and occasional hohdaymakers to tako a few aw a\ Mr Slcath moved au amend ment to rofor the bill to a select committee Iho committee was to consist of Dr Ross, Mr Anderson, Mr Carroll, Mr Affleck, Mr lYavers Jones It waa palpably a burlooquo motion noi/ertheless, quite m keeping with tbo general tenor of private mombors' business Tho bill was pormitted to go into committee, and amiable efforts wero nt onco made on its life, death bung suggested m many plensiDg forms by amendment It was pointed ont that locusts and sheep were detrimental to v ild flower0, and )et there was no mention of thom in the bill Also tbo sun was calculated to affect injuriously " nativo flora" Mr Gormly strong]) advocated reforming tho bill altogether In a candid manner ho sug- gested that tho vital paris should bo first of «11 i mended, and then the bill kicked out altogether It was absurd to seeic to load the Statute Book m this manner, especial.}, he mi^ht havo added, when so mu°h yet remains to be dono in tho w ly of land legislation in tho "Wa^ga distnct It wa> hinted that this pieco of legislation was attempted specislly m the interests of tho tmstces of tho Nrttionnl PUK who wero anxious to lune e\cn moio power than thoy possess at presont And why should not tho public ha\e tho right to pick a fow flowers in tho park ? It had been mndo for its recreation Aud could thero bo any moro wholcsomo recreation than the gathering of a few blossoms ? At this point a contiibutiou waa mudo moro from tho point of Mew of tho management of the Is ttionul Paik than on tho general subject of puking wild flow eis How over, irrole\ant as this might be, it was moro interesting than tho othics of wild flow oi picking, and, moreover, the Houso was affoided somo useful in- formation Ilia public, said Mr Bull, did not go to tlio National Park for tho purposo of gaping at tho trustees* cottage, or watching the trustees' launches ¿omg up and down tho river It would bo much bettor if thoy took meisuxcs to istop bushfires which sometimes raged o\ cr great portions of tho p irk aud dev is t itcd tracts altogether 1 ho Houso seemed to approve these remarks Mr lia)nos proved rather acceptable Mr Haynes is a native flowei -a wild blossom indigenous to the soil-ind ho protested airoinst this orusado launched at othor species of Australim natives Moreover, tbo thing was altogether too half-hearted "Why did not Mr Parnell propose to legislate against tho nativo currant, whoso stono grew outside its skin , tho pnckl) pear and the Bithurst bun? If tbo bon member wished to make Ins name over this business-but heio Mr Inriicll tiercelv inter- rupted "Thank God it's made,11 ho cued Bat after somo excellent fooling Mr Haynes really put tho wholo uiattor m a fow pithy words Ho exclaimed agnnst tho attempt to turn "this theatio of action " into a stage for tho airing of absurdities hko this But Mr ¿arnell is quite proof against light artillen of thin sort-or any sort oí artillen Ile had a solemn dutv as a member of Pailiiinienv to perform, und meant to do it in spito of ridiculo ot attack His effort was mndo not oui) in tho interests of the present races but for generations to como Ho implored the House to bo serious Cries of " Piccndill)," " Pall Mall," and " St James' Squaro " greoted Mr Russoll Jones when he rose to speak nnd whilst ho w as speakuig "Whj it would bo hard to say, since nativo flora havo novtr been a featuro of thoso localities Mr Tones pleaded pathetically for tho protection of wild flowers, and ho explained how lie had expeudol much moue) m connection with nativo roses, flannel flowors, -le After much talk progress was reported, and the Houso on the motion for adjournment wns counted out at 10 inmutes pns*t li
