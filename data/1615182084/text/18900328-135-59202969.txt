FLYNN'S CREEK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) March 27. An extensive bushfire took place in the Upper Flynn's Creek district a few days ago which, before being extinguished, destroyed a large quantity of grass and many chains of fencing. It ignited close to the State school, and owing to the hot weather, swept rapidly through the properties of Messrs Waters, Collins, Maxfield, Enticott, Portch and Norris. A host of energetic workers turned out to stay its progress, but for some time without effect ; in fact, it was the rain that eventually extinguished the flames. Wild dogs are rather troublesome just now, several having been seen at Woodstock lately, The proprietors are on the watch, and will give them a warm reception should. they repeat the visit, I have been shown a sample of the maize grown by Mr J. Braden, on the property lately purchased by him on the Traralgon Creek. It is indeed a splendid sample, and as he assures me the rest of the crop is just as good, it should prove very profitable to him. Mr Boothroyd visited the Upper Flynn's Creek State school for general inspection last week, when he reported as follows:â€” Attendance 19; buildings clean; records correct and made up todate ; discipline good; organization good; the time table has been carefully drawn up and makes suitable pro- vision for all the programme subjects; in- struction satisfactory and methods as a rule are suitable ; the monitors do serviceable work, and seem to take an interest in it; arithmetic had diligent work, proper black- board explanation and correction; the writ- ing was careful, and class correction of errors by means of the black-board was given; the rhymes of the little ones had judicious questioning.
