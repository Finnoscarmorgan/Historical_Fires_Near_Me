NORTHAM. Dec. 2, 1856.—Bush-fires—the scourge of the Australian settler—have again made their appearance in the hill districts. Last week a very extensive one occurred on the Mokine estate, followed about four days af- terwards by another upon the Caroline brook, the run of Mr J. H. Gregory ; the last was but small and fortunately or rather providentially, a heavy shower of rain falling at the time and continuing for some time, pre- vented the extension of what at one time pro- mised to be a most alarming fire. I heard a very large portion of the Gwarabegine estate (the run of Mr C. Wittenoom) was destroyed by fire last week. One of the most barefaced robberies ever perpetrated in this colony took place here a few weeks ago, one which would not have disgraced a twenty years professional jockey in England. Two Natives stole a couple of horses from an establishment in the neigh- bourhood, paid a visit to Wilberforce the re- sidence of Mr Hamersley, jun., whence they coolly appropriated saddles and bri- dles (!) and neither horses nor equipments have since been heard of. I have just heard that one of them has been shot in an attempt to escape from that valuable and energetic police officer Kelly of York, though the wound is not dangerous. The aforesaid young gentry set fire wantonly to Mr Gregory's feed after first robbing the shepherd's hut of the rations.
