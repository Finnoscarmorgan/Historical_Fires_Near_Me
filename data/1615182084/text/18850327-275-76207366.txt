The Rifle Band will perform on the Es- planade this evening for the last time this season. An old man named McKenzie, alias "Yorkey," who is well known in the City by the inordinate length of his hair, suffer- ed a sad loss last Thursday. McKenzie rented from Mr. Geo. Shenton, a fenced paddock of about twenty acres, near Dy- son's Swamp, upon which he had erected a hut in which he lived. Upon the morning of the day mentioned, he left, his place to go to Perth on business, and when he returned home the same evening he found that a bushfire had swept over the paddock and destroyed everything. All the grass, bush, the little crop he had planted, his hut — the unfortunate old man, through no fault of his own, lose his little all, not a single thing having escaped destruction. McKenzie is over eighty years of age, and has always prided himself upon never having had to comes upon the Government for even a sin- gle day's rations. This is a hard case, well deserving of the sympathy and help of the charitably minded portion of the communi- ty, and recommend it to public attention in the hope that something may be done to relieve the poor old man in his present dis- tress.

The harbour (if you can call ib such) is composed ofc' nothing but coral reefs, and the ships have to be moored at the head aad stern to prevent thesn swinging v.'hezi the wind shifts, because if they did they would strike on the opposite coral reef.
