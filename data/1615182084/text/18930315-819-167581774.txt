PBESTON. (From a Correspondent.) March 13. Saturday last, the 11th iust., was the appointed day for the meeting of the Preston Progress Association and a goodly number of members rolled up iu response to the advertisement convening the meeting but I hear that after all no meeting was held, but for what reason I caunot tell, unless it was that the President was not pre* sent. If this was so it speaks very little for the vice-president as it looks as though he is unable to conduct a meeting. This, however, I do not know, but one thing is certain it is a great pity to allow the Association to lapse for the want of a little energy, more especially as it has up to the present time been of great benefit to this district. To show what interest the members have in its welfare it is not very pleasing to note that they preferred a cricket match to the meet ing. I should not have written so strongly on the subject only a very important question have been discussed, viz., the choice of a can* didate to fill the vacancy, caused by the retirement of Mr. j. Trigwell, who represented this district in the Wellington lioads Board. Now I consider—I believe all. voters in this part agree with me—that if possible the different districts onght to be represented by local men who must naturally, through living near the spot, know considerably more of the wants of the district than an outsider or a member living in town, aud, therefore, I am very much surprised that the meeting referred to did not take place. I still hope, however, that a candidate will couie forward to represent this part of the district. We have great competition now in the buichering department on the Preston. One person is trying to run the other off by retailing meat at 3d. per lb., but 1 do not think it will last. The absurdity of the business is that he could get a better price by selling wholesale to the town butchers with out consequently any of the risks incidental to butchering. We have had splendid rains lately which have caused the country to look quite fresh and green, though I faucy that those farmers who have delayed their bush-firing until this month will not appreciate them so much as £ should think that they have quite put a stop to firing this year.
