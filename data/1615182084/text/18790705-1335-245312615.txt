MATCHES AND BUSH-FIRES. A PETITION to Parliament is now going round the country for signature, the prayer of which is that the importation into the colony of any matches other than those known as " safety matches" shall be forbidden. No one cau deny that bush fires are largely due to preventable causes, and that a very great number of them is caused by the care less use of common lucifers. Any proposal therefore by which the use of these matches can be lessened is worthy of consideration. It will be remembered that a Bill, having the same object very nearly became law a few years ago, and cogent reasons were brought forward in support of the exclusion. But at the same time there is much to be said on the other side, and it does appear somewhat like descending to frivolities for an Act to be passed to dictate to the people what kind of match they shall use. We are of opinion that a great number of bush fires are caused by the carelessness of many of those persons who will sign the petition, and were farmers generally to purchase only patent safety matches for use in their families, and to prohibit their employes from using any other kind on their farms, their would not be any need to pass such h for. It i? the demand which creates the supply as regards matches or anything else. But seeing that people often need to be guarded against themselves it would perhaps be as well, taking into consideration the the climate of the colony and the immense loss annually occasioned by bush fires to pass an Act as asked for. * m * Since the above was written, we notice that in the Legislative Council the Chief Secretary, in answer to the Hon. T. Hogarth, said it was not the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill to prevent the inportation of lucifier matches. We presume the petitions will still be circulated, as in die event of a large number of signatures being olt lined, the Government Would probably change their views.
