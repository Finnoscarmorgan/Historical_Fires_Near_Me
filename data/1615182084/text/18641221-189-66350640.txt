-. TOCK REPORT. DENILIQUIN:-In fat cattle, the following mobs have gone down during the cirremt week:-On Tuesday, 400, Jenkins'; and to-day, 269, Kirk Goldsbrough's; and 487, Keighrans. In fat sheep, we have had three flocks on Saturday, 3000, Glass'; on Monday, 1740, Morgan's; and on Wednesday, 2100, Downie's. On Monday, 580 store cattle (Smith's) crossed, the river. On Tuesday, Mr M'Collough's (of Power, Rütherford and Co.) auction sale of store cattle took place in the yards, and 569 head were sold to Mr. H> Ricketson, of Baratta, at £2 15s—equal to cash. Mr Taylor has also sold 100 head to Mr. Dickson, of Cooroonboon, at a saftisfactory figure. Inquiries are frequent for this description of stock, and although one or two mobs are reported as being on the road hither, as a supply they will be totally inadequate. During the week 4000 sheep have been sold by the owner of Warbreccan station to Mr Macfarlane, of Baroga. The price has not transpired. Bush-fires have been nu- merous, and although in one or two places fences have run considerable risk, care and watchfulness appear hitherto to have successfully warded off serious disaster. The Edward is rapidly approaching its summer level, and the hot weather has been pleasantly broken by a day's rain. Deniliquin Chronicle, 16th December.
