IMMENSE BUSH-FIRE IN THE BERRIGAN DISTRICT- A NUMBER OF SQUATTERS BURNT OUT. TOCUMWAL, Wednesday. A bush fire, caused by the carelessness of a man who threw away a burning match after lighting his pipe, broke out yesterday in the Berrigan district on the selection of a farmer named Quade. A high wind from the north was blowing at the time, and the flame, spread with marvellous rapidity, causing immense destruction. In a short time, in spite of every exertion, the holdings of Quade, M'Lei lan, Cruickshank, Carter, Robinson, Aitken, Mitchell, Graham, Cameron, and others were more or less devastated by the flames. All of these lost much grass, and many of them more or less of their growing crops, varying from 20 to 90 acres. The latest netra states that to-day the fire was travelling on to Momo> long, carrying all before it, JEBILDERIE, Wednesday, A large bush Are broke out yesterday on the west side of Berrigan, raged furiously all day, and last night was sweeping everything before it and coming towards Wunnamurra run. It is reported that many settlers have been burned completely out, losing their houses, crops, and everything. On account of the dryness and length of the grass very little can be done to stop the fire, and unless rain comes there is no knowing where it will end.
