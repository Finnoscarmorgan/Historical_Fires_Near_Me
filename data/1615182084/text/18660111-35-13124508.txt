BEGA. [rllOM OUR COllllESrONDENT.] WEATHER extremely hot and oppressivo; no rain; tho thermometer yesterday, in the shado, Btood at 109 degroes. Hnrvcst all in ; yield, unexpectedly, very satisfactory. Bush-fires rngiDg ; no feed ; cattle dying in numbers. . AB the Government aro on tho ovo of retrenchment, wo think it would be advisablo for them to save the expense of holding a District Court in this district (Edon), or else | give us moro than ono in fho year, and moro I ¡moly notico than is now given for tko Court to bo he-Id at Eden, on the 23id instant, which notico only appeared on tho Polico office door on Pi ¡day last, thus leaving us no time to ule our pleas, as required by tho Act. Any business person having occasion to suo any of his debtors is virtually shut out from doing so for another twelve months, and porhaps then bo served, as now, with a notico somi days late. Some are of opinion here that it would bo much bettor to take the Distiict Court from bein nltogclhor, and to allow suitors the privilcgo of going to Sydney, whoro they w.uild bu entitled to thoir costs, which, if they apply to the Suprime Court under the present arrangement, they are deprived of; the costs in most cases amounting lo very noar us much ns the debt. The District Court here, as at pre5ont constituted, is nothing moro than a ahani and a delusion. 7lh January.
