W. RICHARDSON, Handicapped BIOYOLE CARNIVAL. TBUKIKQ NOTES.-By "WOOIUKDA," Training operations were again resumed on the Exhibition bicycle track on Mon- day afternoon. The work among the amateurs was confined to half and three quarter pace. Smith, the champion, was out for quiet work, but I learn that he has not entered for either of the ama- teur raccB of the Hospital Sports next j Saturday. It ÍB reported, however, that he is training for tlie League races on the following Saturday. Stewart was doing quiet work, as were also Sweusson and Sandemaii. The New South Wales riders, Cameron and Wearing, did fast work. Alphonso Brown bowled along for some miles, and he tells ? me that It is his Intention this afternoon to attempt to lower the ten-mile record of Saturday last He has succeeded in obtaining the services of a large number of pacemakers, and the tandem will also, I believe, give a hand. Fitzpat- rick has again gone on a visit to friends in Gympie. He will not be able to use his arm, which was Injured In the ten mile championship, for some days yet Furnell, the /other Sydney man, who also sustained severe bruises in the same race, btlll has his arm in a sling, though he Is somewhat better. Pickburn lias Bocured a racer for next Saturday, and i should be heard of In both of the handi- caps. A large number of other ama- teurs were also pedalling along, but their movements wore uninteresting. Wootten and Williams, of the League of New South Wales Wheelmen, who arrived from Sydney hy steamer on Monday, visited the track in the after- noon, but did not do any work. Adam and M'Intosh were doing fast work. Megson punctured his back tire, but got on another machine, and completed his afternoon's work. Krown, Maguire, Mines. I>ney, Walne, Head, and a num- ber of others were also out HOSPITAL SP0RT8 CARNIVAL. THE HANDICAPS.

" The intention of the Government In this as in all other matters is to do the best they can for the public interest," was the somewhat oracular reply of the Premier to Mr. Rawllngs's question about the Treasury notes. The Lucinda trip cost the country £503 Os. 10d., which as a twenty-four days' trip for twenty-eight persons is not ex cessivö, being at the rate of 14s. ll%d. per man per day. TheXflrst instalment of the extended deposits held 'from the Government by the Queensland National Bank was re- paid on Monday, and placed In reserve beyond the control of any bank. The amount still held by the bank on ex- tended deposit is just over two millions. Mr. Browne resumed the debate on the Address in reply. His remarks were, as usual, moderate In tone, and he com- manded the attention of the House. Mr. Browne asserts that the Minis- terialists have made a " corner" in loyalty, with the member for Oxley as head of the Byhdlcate. Mr. Dawson, Hie senior member for Charters Towers, ;s one of ' fh'e best speakers and keenest debaters on the Opposition side of the House, and his speech last night showed a marked im- provement in oratory. As was to be expected, the administra- tion of the Lands Department waa sharply criticised by the member for Barcoo, in connection wlUi the with- drawal of land after it had been thrown open for selection. One of the chief features of jester day's debate was the speeóh of Mr Bell, Who has apparently become a most hearty supporter of the Government. Mr. Jackson has given notice of a. series of questions on the suggested alteraüon in the system of branding. Private members outside the Labour party will have but little chance of get- ting anything through, to judge by the business paper. Already notice of mo- tion has been given in favour of an annual poll-tax on the employment of Asiatic or African allens ; a bill to abolish the Council's power of veto ; a bill to limit the security to the mortgaged property ; and a motion favouring a schedule rate of wages on Government contracts. In answer to i questions propounded at a mating of his constituents at Grand- chester the other day, Mr. Cribb, M.L.A., said he would favour the borrowing of money by the Government to be lent out to farmers at an advance of 1% or 2 per cent. Mr. Powers has tabled a motton to compel sugar companies whose deben- tures are guaranteed by the Government to have their machinery manufactured in the colony unless local tenders are more than 10 per cent above those re- ceived from outside. Mr. Heussler is usually very entertain- ing in the Legislative Council, and com- mands much affectionate regard, but he astonished many of his old colleagues yesterday by a very warm commendation of a form of State Socialism. Mr. Heuss- ler, however, made it very clear that he did not believe In the levelling down process so favoured, he said, by agitators and Social Democrats. " Promoters of Strife," Mr. Macdonald Paterson termed a certain section in our industrial and political life, but Mr. Brentnall gives a revised version : *' Pro motors of Strikes !" Mr. Du Maurler said to an interviewer recently, " I think that the best years in a man's life are after he is 40. So .Trollope used to say. Does Daudet say so too ? A man at 40 has ceased to hunt the moon. I would add that In order to enjoy life after 40 It is perhaps necessary to have achieved, before reach- ing that age, at least some success." He spoke of the letters he has been receiving since the " boom," and said that on an average he received five letters a day from America of a most nattering de- scription. " Some of my correspondents, however, don't give a man his . du," " he remarked with a shadow of a smile. .
