Jerry's Plains. (From a Correspondent.) THE entertainment which took place on Friday, the 25th inst. was not attended with the success which we have been usually able to command. Everything seemed to conspire against the affair being conducted to a successful issue. The frequent occurrence of bushfires occasioned the absence of some of the dramatic amateurs, who lived at a distance, from several rehearsals, and the farces suffered in consequence. Also the management were disappointed at the last moment of promised assist- ance in the musical part of the entertain- ment and were considerably embarrassed thereby, as this place is not so prolific in musical talent that a gap of the kind can be filled up on the instant. It is not pleasant to record failure, and therefore it is some consolation to think that my next item of news con- tains the very reverse. In the cricket match played between the second eleven of Singleton and the J. P. U. C.C. our men won a hard fought victory. In the early part of the match the Singleton men had it all their own way, and when the J. P. men went in for their second innings they had 113 runs to get, but they set manfully to work and owing to the magnificent batting of L. Hobden not only made the requisite number but had six runs to spare. Mason and Shaw batted well for Singleton. The former gave several chances which were not taken. There were but nine men on each side, neither club being able to bring its full strength into the field. The J. P. men shewed their delighted appreciation of L. Hobden's excellent play by carrying him on their shoulders to the pavilion amidst hearty cheering. He went in first and carried out his bat in both innings.
