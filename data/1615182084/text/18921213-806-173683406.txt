BUSH FIRES IN THE RIVERINA DISTRICT. Argus. ALBURY, Friday. The simultaneous outbreak of bush-fires in almost every part of the Riverina district, as well as on the Murrumbidgee River, gives point to a somewhat alarming statement mndo in Albury yesterday by a well- known Murray pastoral ist, to tbe effect that num bers of swagsraon, presumably unionists, passing through this season bad been beard to express their determination to “have revenge on the farming class (who wore responsible for having convicted the strike loaders at Doniliquin), by setting fire to farms wherever an opportunity presented itself." It is reported that similar throats have boon made m different parts of thb dis trict, and by different sots of men, which would scorn to suggest that the matter bad been discussed in more than one - quarter. However, many of the farmers about hero arc apprehensive that mischief will bo 1 done by some of the numerous swagamtn who are now on the tramp, ostensibly in search of work, and it has oven been hinted, that the fires which Havo already occurred'* may bo attributable to tho undoubtedly hostile fooling towards farmers aroused amongst certain classes of laborers by the Doniliquin con spiracy trial episode. It is remarked that in several instances this season fires ’ have broken out in farming localities, although there is much less • risk in such places of accidental ignition than on pasloral holdings, whoro men aro wont to camp and to handle fire carelessly.
