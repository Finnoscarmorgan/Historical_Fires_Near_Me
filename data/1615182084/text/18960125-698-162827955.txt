Weather, Pastoral, Crops. The extreme heat of this unprecedented seasonhas continued nearly throughout tne previous week, and has resulted in an appalling loss of life by sunstroke and beat apoplexy. The sufferings endured by all classes have been extreme, and the losses occasioned to stock have been excessive. The fierce scorching winds have desiccated the herbage and* added to the perplexity of pastoralists to provide feed for their flocks.- Since Saturday raiu baa visited tne colony between tne ex treme points of Gobar and Hay, and covering a comparatively moderate area. Another tropical change has since been reported, with a promise, of rain over the Western districts. The oool southerly change of Saturday did not extend over a sixth df the colony lying north of a line from Bqprke, Warren, and Tarn worth. In the metropolis the death rate was materially increased by the beat, chiefly infante and the aged being sufferers, and no less than 250 deaths were recorded for the week within a short radius of the city. The death rate at Bourke was exceptionally severe, 27 deaths occurring from heat, including Mr. G. C. Loughnan, ex-M.L.A. At Warren 20 cues of heat apoplexy have occurred, and very many other places record two or more deaths. The effects of -the heat wave on pasturage have been disastrous. At Warren feed and water are drying np with incredible rapidity, and the stock routes are barb. Maize at Molong is nearly beyond recovery, sind the ? fruit crop is the worst known for years. At Milton drought and bushfires have consumed the scanty herbage left in the district. , Millions of fish have perished in Copago Lake, near Lake Dick, Wil oannia, owing to the heat, and thousands of pelicans throng its edge. AtWollongong the water' supply on many farms has given out, and the district is in a deplorable state. The following reports were received on Saturday, at the Sydney Observatory, and represent what is probably the heaviest list of excessive temperatures ? ever recorded in New South Wales in a single day. The names of the stations are set oat in alphabetical order. Readings are for true shade temperatures : — Albury, 107* Goulburn, 106' M&rrumbnmb;, Balranald, 118* - jGrafton. 103* 106* ' Batliurst, 101* jGulgong, 102' Narrabri. 104* Bingara, 103' -3unnedah,-101' Nimity belle, 100' Bourke, 116' ;Hav, 114' Newcastle, 101' Brew&rrina;, 117* Hillston, 115' Nymagee, 108' ?

The others ranged generally from 80' to 99* in the shade. The reports from the districts where rain has fallen are more cheering. With ground so hot as it is the moisture has at . once stimulated the herbage into growth, and especially where bush fires have raged their fertilising action is seen in the vivid green im parted to the grass. The heat wave overlapped Victoria, and similar reports (though less painful) have been received throughout the southern colony. The effect upon the herbage is telling on the milk returns and reducing the quantities of batter going forward for export. The matured views of the harvest returns tend to con firm the full extent of the anticipated deficiency of wheat. At present there is a brisk trade m produce doing with West Australia The South Australian wheat report is more favour . ... if- , 'J , able than was at first mentioned, bnt it is extremely .' ' unlikely that a single ton will leave Australian shores for Europe. Tasmania has enjoyed varied and comparatively cool weather with acceptable showers -*f rain, bene fiting the hop and root crops considerably, as well as checking bush fires. Ih Queensland the heat wave has not been experi enced, and farming aspects are not by any means so distressful. The Government is taking steeps to pro vide seed wheat under precautions against the fraud to which State charity is so frequently subject.
