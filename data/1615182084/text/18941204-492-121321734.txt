STEWART'S BROOK. After three weeks of the most severe summer weather experienced here in November for a number of years, a most delightful change has occurred. On Wednesday last heavy clouds began to gather and towards evening a thunderstorm passed over. Not a great deal of rain fell, but the air was cooled, and since then each day we have had a small allowance of rain. We hear the storm was heavier down at Bolltrees, so it has extended well. Sunday (yesterday) was quite wintery, making us take brisk walks to be comfortably warm. Though not nearly enough rain ; yet what has fallen wilf do an immense amount ot good, tlie ground nad become very dry, and grass hud gone off amazingly. Some extensive bushfires were raging close at hand, fill ing the air with smoke for a few days so as to make it only Beein transparent. Tbe claims here are not doing brisk work, the Standard bairjfr tke only one on anything approach ing rich Htone in large quantities, the last crushing from this claim yielded 66oz. retortfld gold from 20 tons. J. WooderRon, junr., and J. Wall have about 5 tone from the Imperial standard to be treated, and Messrs. Moore and Party have 7 tonB from the Grovner ready to be put through. The stone is rather hard to eatiinate. Stewart's Brook, Dec. 3, 1894.
