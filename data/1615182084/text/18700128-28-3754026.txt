VICTORIA PLAINS, The weather continues dreadfully hot, water is very scarce, and the stock both sheep and cattle suffer very much for want of it. Sheep owners are very hard pushed how to keep their flocks alive, !for one ^misfortune never comes alone- to the scarcity of water is to be added the want of feed, the country being as bare as it can be, and bush-fires are ravaging right and left. Mr. Forrest passed on his way to the North last Monday; we are glad to hear he is going to mark out a new line of road from the North to the Catholic Mission ; it «ill be a great thing if even it is only a line of road j marked and showing the watering places, to the many poor travellers who at present cannot perform the journey without many hardships and endangering their lives. Something is to be done to clear out some of the dogs, of which every native keep3 as many as he chooses and more than he can feed ; it is very common to see. a native with five or six half-starved dogs crawling after him ; these dogs attack sheep as well as the wild ones, and at night, they crawl to the .homesteads and get hold of anything they can, they even know how to take a piece of mutton out of a pot, and go wild when they como to the last state of starv- ation. Someone will say tbat the owners of the different stations ought themselves to do away with such a curse, and that nothing more easy than to shoot or poison them ; Yes ; but I say that they cannot do it without exposing them- selves to very serious consequences. A native lo ves. his dogs, and will avenge himself ou any one, who will deprive him of them j it Í3 only the police constable who can destroy them wVch out any fear ; the natives dread his name, and they cannot set fire to his runs, nor c-^n they spear his sheep, ¿c.
