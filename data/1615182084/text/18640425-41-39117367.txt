MOUNT PLEASANT. fFrom our own CorresDondenti Mount Pleasant April SO. un inursuay last an extensive nre took pioce on Mr. Murray's run, by which several thousand acres of feed were consumed, including a great part of the ReeHv Creek Survey. The wind was not very high at the time, or there is no knowing where the mischief would have stopped. T,he loss must be heavy, but would have been worse at an earlier period of the season than now, when young grass may shortly be expected. I hear that the fire originated in a log left alight on ? neighbouring farm after stubble-burning; and if this be so, it is an instance of very culpable carelessness, Messrs. Lewis, timmiilw, have left this neigh bourhood for the purpose of establishing them selves at Angaston, and there is therefore a good opening in this branch of industry, which we shall be glaa-to see filled as soon as possible. And, to pass from the tinkering of pots and pans to that of the human constitution, I may mention that a medical man possessed of a Glasgow diploma has been visiting us lately with the design of establishing himself here; but find ing no encouragement in a district already oocu pied, betas gone northwards to look for employ ment among the steep-ilations, where I should tliiqk there must be vacant places enough in which a properly qualified man would be gladly received.
