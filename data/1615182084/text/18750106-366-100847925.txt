TUENA AND DISTRICT. (From our correspondent.) WHAT with matrimonial alliances and electioneer ing, our Christmas holidays have passed not so monotonously as a great-many preceding ones. On Monday last our township presented an un usually lively appearance. Horsemen word seen riding hither nnd thither; groups of politicians dis cussing the merits and demerits of the candidates for Carcoar were scttered about; and around the court house (the polling- place) numbers were collected, voting and criticising. At the fixed hour the poll was opened pro forma by Mr. Sidney Smith, return ing-officer, Mr. Laws, clerk of poll, and Messrs. Gordon and Madew, scutineers. The candidates were Mr. Icely and Mr Meyer, and voting went on wih spirit till the hour of closing, when the result was--for Mr. Icely 27 votes, Mr. Meyer 56 votes. From conversations I have had since Monday with several parties I learn that a great many of Mr. Icely's supporters, leading gentlemen of the district, mistook the daly; otherwise, from the number of votes they would have recorded, would no doubt have pIaced Mr. Icely in the majority. On Tuesday Iast the races at Mr. John McKenzie's went off very agreeably. On Tuesday evening we were visited by a very severe thunderstorm. A tree was splintered by the electric fluid. Bush-fires of great extent almost surround us. 30th December, 1874.
