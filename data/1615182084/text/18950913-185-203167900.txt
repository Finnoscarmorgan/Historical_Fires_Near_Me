FIRE AND DROUGHT IN NEW SOUTH WALES. EXCITING TRAIN ADVENTURE. Age Whilst the Sydney to Bathurst mail train was crossing the mountains on Tuesday, a most sensational experience befol it. Be tween Blackheath and Mount Victoria a long stretch of fire was met with, and per haps not folly aware of the extent of the fierceness of the blaze, which extended on each side of the line, the driver opened ont the throttle of his engine to run the gauntlet. The train got through, but after a fearful few minuses. The driver and tho fireman had their hair singed off, their clothes were burnt, and they were severely hurt. The flames licked into the carriages through the open windows, destroying goods in the racks, and setting alight in two cases to passengers’ clothing. All over the moun tains tho railway lines are in danger, and ceaseless vigilance is required to prevent the sleepers being burnt. Reports from the country districts still record the continuance of bush-fires, though in moat instances they are moderating owing to the change in the wind. The township of Sherbrook is now believed to be quite out of danger, though, though volunteers from Bull! are still on the watch to cope with any fresh outbreak. Owing to the drought the price of cattle at Bathurst has risen from £3 to £8 per head. Meat has risen in the city 2-1 per lb all round, and vegetables of good quality and local growth are absolutely unattainable.-
