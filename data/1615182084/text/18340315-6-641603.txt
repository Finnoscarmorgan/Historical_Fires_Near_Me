FIRE. A BUSH-FIRE,—the dread of which has long haunted us—occasioned by the natives, but not with any malicious intent, on Thursday last, com- municated with a flat loaded with hay, which had been left secured in the rushes a short distance above the flats; in a few seconds the whole of the property in the flat was destroyed; which con- sisted of half a ton of flour, and 3 tons of hay, belonging to Mr. Gresswell, of Fremantle. The loss is considerable. The flat was the property of Mr. Tanner, known as his large flat, and was worth at least 60l. The flour at the present mar- ket price, may be estimated at 25l., and the hay, if delivered at Fremantle, at 36l, making a total loss of 121l. This is a serious calamity, but hap- pily, by the active exertions of a detachment of the 21st Fusiliers, ordered out immediately an intimation was given to his Honor the Lieutenant Governor of the impending danger, the fire, which was spreading its destructive ravages, was got under at a short distance from Mr. Collins' house. Had not this timely aid been afforded, the whole of his premises must have been destroyed, and there would not have beep the slightest chance of rescuing any portion of his property. We noticed with gratification, a manly emulation amongst the men to be first at the scene of action, which did them credit. The practice of leaving boats on the water side, partly laden, as the flat was with flour, is highly reprehensible. The temptation it offers to the natives, to say nothing of the ex- posure to casualties, such as the occurrence we have just related, should lead to its discon- tinuance.
