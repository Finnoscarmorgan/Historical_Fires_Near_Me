TO THE EDITOR OF THE ALBURY BAH NEE. SIB,—Would you kindly giant me space in your columns to correct a statement made by your Berrigan correspondent te the Momalong fire-breaks. In your issue of the 25'b ultimo, ft* eUtes, "Srwgs were Reared op Mcmalong, but are in many cases not ploughed, or ploughed so badly as to render them useless." Now, sir, as this is an untruthful statement, and evidently written by a person who prob< ably has not seen the breaks In question, in justice to myself I may state that over 40 mileB have been ploughed for fire breaks this season, in strips up to one chain wide. The estate, which consists of 30,000 acres, is divided into seven blocks by strips being cleared of all dead timber from 1| to 4 chains in width, all of which have been carefully ploughed in two strips, leaving an unploughed portion between, which can safely be burned should it be deemed necessary. The bush-fire that was burning on Berrigan station during the early part of this week was stopped at the Momalong boundary break. Thanking you in anticipation.—I remain yours, &?., JOHN A. CULLE7, Manager. Momalong, December 10,1892.
