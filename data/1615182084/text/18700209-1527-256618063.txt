BUNBURY. [From our own correspondent] Febry. 7th. 1870. Cologne is not a very sweet smelling place, nor yet is Constantinople; but all the odors, German and Turkish, which ever offended a delicate olfactory nerve, if combined and destilled into one great nasty smell, would be nothing to the stench we may expect in Bunbury shortly. The obtrusive bar of the Lechenault estuary has been inconsiderate enough to increase to such an extent as to be a bar indeed. The river can't get into the sea, and the sea can't get into the river, which has become a stagnant rapidly evaporating pool of filthy water. Fish of all description from sharks downwards find their lives insupportable in their vitiated element, and either die natural deaths hourly, or commit suicide, finding it nobler in the piscine mind to take arms against a sea of impurities, than to put up with the stings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Imagine the result, or, better still, come down and stroll for an hour with me at midday on the beach. Then again the bush is all bush-fire, and that port of the atmosphere of the town which isn't smell is smoke. We are going to draw lots for a last man, and all the inhabitants but the last man are about to emigrate; leaving the last man particular instructions to die on the spot, after erecting on the bar a huge cenotaph, as huge as he can in the short time be is likely to have for the work with this inscription ' non redolet sed olet. QUOE REDOLERE SOLET. !'
