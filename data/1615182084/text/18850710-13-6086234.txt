Cahors was continued to day The examination of Thomas Head, tho steersman, was continued. Ile said,-I went to the wheel at 2 o'clock, and remained up to 4 It rained tu ice I could not distinguish the trees It was rockj near the Clarence, with no trees distinguishable We were opposite the North Solitary at 12 o'clock It was a line night. We »ero fullj four miles oft the coast A good time elapsed after striking before we saw tho Clarence light To Mr Rogers-I have seen Hi uns s Kief several times, and nlwajs noticed a break on it Herbert Dawes, steersman, recalled,-I cannot say if the chief officer left tho wheel after I went to it 1 rom then till the ship struck, I siw linn live or sit times at different mteivals. I have no reason to believe that lie left the bridge at nil I did not mean to infer in my former evi- dence that because I did not sec lum he was away A strict watch was mvarmblj kept on the bridge It was possible for the officer of the watch and the look out both to be doing their dutv w ltliout mj seeing them all the time from the wheel I mean that Mor gan was attending strictlj to his dut), and might have been wallang up and down the budge all the while I was on the top of the wheel house, and he might have occasionally gone m there. Ile might have gone below by the after ladders without mj seeing him, but I have no leason to believe that he did so Kobort Hell, chief cook, deposed,-I have been 10 vcars at sea, 10 of them along the Australian coast, and I am a tolerablj good judge of distances. I have many times passed the Clarence Heads ncaier than the list time. \\\e were more than four miles oft, I should saj It was raining v erj heav ilj nt about half past 5 I had no watch, but I knew the time of day without one oniiig to the routine of the work The shower was a lieavi black squall I could not see the lund part of the ship from the gallej It was a. short heavj shower It was 10 or 11 minutes to 0 when I went to wa_h before going to carve m the saloon I heard the chief officer call out from the bridge for the captain Al most direct!) niter, ulule Iwns finishing wash ing, the ship struck T he ruin had then ceased I looked up and also saw the lookout man I Tías burning a bluelight on the bridge along Bide Cuptain Walkei w hen he sind, " Cook, j ou had better go down and help them with those roekets, thej don t appear to be making a verj good list of it ' I went down and relieved \\\ arburton, who went away and tired a bov of about a do7en detonators bj striking them on the deck 1 had three blue lights left m mj pocket, and 1 burned them, using one to light the rockets To mj know ledge l8 bluehghts were burned Warburton gave me nine rockets win n I went to relieve lum Tour had been shot up previously I lired seven of the nine until Captain Walker sang out from the upper bridge "\ou are vers e_triiva"ant with those rockets How manyhavejou lett'" 1 replied, "Two sir ne called out, "Ileserv them for "the liurwah " \\\ hen sho hove m sight, I ion to get these, but Warburton hud a couple nlreadj on the blicks and told me to keep minc and ure his I did so, and then put m> two m the rack in the whtelhouse at the back of the Hags After we thought we had emptied the rocket chest, I examined it, and between the pudding and the side, I found another bluoli-ht Having hurt mj leg I got half an hour s leave off \s soon as we got a rcplv irom the llunvah, I prepared and lit a flare up 'i he Ilunv ah s boats usked for a li"Vit to work bv nnd 1 rigged up i large pot, and hung it on a chain 1 took some knives from the e,allcj, and handed them round for use to mi) one who asked 'J he men had nothing to eat from noon until 10 o clock nevt morn ing except b loaf of bread and a bit o£ beef to the crew of one boat Ihej were woiking in the boats almost continually day and night Captain Walker, when the ship struck, never left the upper bridge from 0 pm until after 4 o'clock the next afternoon The passengers luggage was put in the social linll, the driest place and later on passed foi ward I had made arrangements to pass the luggage aboard the Dione as soon as we got the mails out, but the Clarence pilot dis heartened us bj singing out, " Walker, j ou had better come out of that vessel and jour wen too , you will never have a finer time, and you can get aboard tomorrow" That was the reason the men could not work an) longer, and also because the Diente would not wait during the night The Cahors had not hardened down when we got tho boats Bwung in the davits 'j.ney weie not lowered for some considerable time afterwards To Mr Itogers -It was half past 2 or 3 p m w hen the captain of the Dione advised Captain Walker to come ofl The former sang out, "Send no more luggage, I will take no more to night, send jour men alon^ if you are coming off that ship " Somo of the crew baved their own luggage I lost nearly everj thing I was foimerly an ordinary seaman I have very good sight On passing the Clarence Heads I saw the breakers, but did not notice any trucks 1 think we were about flvo miles off when I noticed the shore I was cutting up poultry I have often seen Evans s Keef There is not always a break on it Kuli) one said so it ia not correct As a matter of fact, I never saw any break on it until we struck, and never w ent so near before. To the President -1 o my knowledge, there were 15 rockets and 10 bluehghts, including the extra one I found The captain told me he did not require the cannon to _. ï fired Both sides of the copper maga Kin"C were filled with gunpowder. Wc showed dist WS3 signals for about three quarters of ailv hour, thinking that the Clarence light was tb e Uurwah, but we stopped on finding out our mistake We waited till she hove in sight) arf 1 tnen burned out the last two blue lights, an'el 8ne answered the si"nal I sighted the Clarence light aboutan honrafter striking T 'lie passengers had not such a good opportll iity of seeing what was going ori>a_ I'libd Herbert Steve nson, bedroom steward de pöBetf -The bedi'oom l'ghts were lit about half past 5pm jVftcr the first dinner bell rang' it commenced' to rain, and I went to shut the saloon bM 'lights as the ram was going slightly througli Hy the time I had got most of thom se Tewed it had nearly ceased raining 1 had fi *ed all but two when the vessel struck atld 1 urcbed Each bed room steward after til, passengers weie Baved, set to work saving the luggage It was taken from the social lilli to the fore hatch in readiness for transh vpping It waa not light enough to see loi m1 when we struck Angus Murray, lorecabin stcvaiil, doposed, -I recollect) elbsing the forecabin ports twice before the vessel struck, owin¿ to the rain, first at about half past 2 and no\t bo tween 0 andhalf paste Hie steerage pasBengei*8 were nearly all below when bhe struck, in e inse quence of the rain To Mr Itogers -I happened t> look shove wajs when off Clarenco Heads but could no4 see tile land, being at least live milpa off Benjamin Davis chief stew ird said-1 he electric lights were put on at 10 mniules to C pm It was unusually dark I saw no danger from having bla-ing lights about the deck I ordered the skyjifchts to be elosed owing to the rain, before she Btruelc My first order after the passengers were seen to was to order the luggage into the social hail in readiness for removal The ciew took thred or four hours getting the minis on board the Dione nor captain would not wait for the luggage being frightened that he would be unable to cross the Richmond bar Hobert Morgan, chief officer, recalled - The vessel was riot near enoogh to the Clarence to sirtg'B out anything but the lighthouse I looked with the glasses, and eaw no Mocks. I »wear positively that I never lift the bndgp after I relieved Warburton It is fal«« to tay that 1 waa relieved by Warburton, nnd left the bridge to throw in a rallie I relieved 'Waiburton for that purpose, and he was not thrco minutes absent I did not tell Miss Cuttler that the wreck was duo to a deviation of the compass I admitted to her that it was mj first vorige north There were nhjtost 20 rockets on board, and nbout a couplo of doren bluehghts. '1 wo packages of the latter were not opened until the uightof the wreck, after ever) one but I and Captain Walker had left the Cahors I know thero were several rockets loft aboard We had a case of Holmes s patent sumáis, and also Daviss patents. Mr Perkins and other passengers were running about hunting for them, and not finding any in tho explosives chest, Mr Perkins called out that there vv as not another rocket ou the ship Lv or) thing was done to siivc the luggage lo Mr RoDero-lho captain told me nt hall post 5 to alter the course to N by L. ni stead of N half 1" He asl ed me at about 10 minutes to S p. m how far off the Clarence ITeads were when we passen them, and I re plied about Ave miles I wont sa) that he did not apeak to Mrs Peikins. I did speak to Miss Cuttler alter we struck tho reef, but I did not have a long conversation with her Hie first timo 1 had ever spoken to her I ntl v ised her to go among the other ladies, and not get wet with the spra) as theie was no unniediatedaugerof gettingdrowned Atluilf p ist 5 or a quartet to 0 tho captain did not say tome, " Where are you now' Nordid I point to some land abeam, and Btv), "lhere is Lvans Head The captuin did not sij, Don t talk nonsense, )ou cant get Lvans Head till G o clock , wevo not run the dis tance Keep n good look out This con vcrsation did not tal o place at that time If we had passed n mile and a half or two miles off the Clarence Heads, the courso ive were steering ought to have cleared the reef I took her position when the lleuda were on our beam, and estimated from another bearing that she had passed five miles off 1 can f,ive not the slightest expia nation of how ne got on the reef Hie whole of the coast was obscured with gloom and a white mist with a hejit N L wind Wo lind three or four showers during my after noon watch I did not see the sun at all lhere nasa slight break on the reef when vvcbtruck It was nbout hiifhwatcr 1 did not know when it was until the weather luted lo Mr Vi ant-I calculated our dis tance from land by a four point bearing the most accurate plan lo Mr Rogers.-Tho captain never said, 1 keep tho ship out another halt point, that is N by 11, until 1 have u look ut the ehart lo the President-I cannot sa) if the cap tam then left the bridge lhere wore no awnings on the hurricane deck 1 he passen teis on the top of it had equal opportunities with mo ot judging tho weather , those below bud not lo the Hoard -I could not well discern the land The hist lime 1 saw it was about 5 p. ni lo the Piesident-kelly caroo bothering me about a rattle several times, and even bor ion ed dice from the steward. I relieved \\\ urourton between J nnd halt past 2 p m to let hint throw I asked Mr Perkins at about Dor hulf post 0 a. m u he vi us going to have a ticket The onlj interest I tookinit was that the chief engineer had promised to feiv e nie the picture of the ship if he won it I actually drucc,ed one male passenger nnd Ins luggage out of one of the life boats before she was launched I also liad to drag other men from the boats before they left the davits. We vveie greatly nn peded b) the people crowding round lhere was no difficult) in tettingthe boats out The) vvould have been out ni halt the time but for the passengers J he men did their duty promptl) 1 saw no scarcity of kim es or axes Some of the passengers vv eie running about with knives cuttnv mi) thing they could come across. One of them was tr)ing to cut away the iron gu)s of the funnels, thinl ing he was doing tood servico I believe tho weather clothes were ricked all round Hie bist discipline was kept up strict!) Au ollicers bridge boole was kept, showing the courses and reliefs, and the bri l"e was never w ithout any ofheer Before ¡,oing to their cabins the oflicers always verbally reported progress to the captain oi| being relieved .Lilward 'Warburton, recalled, said,-The îalllc was over by half past 2 It is a false hood to Bay that it did not commence until 1 pin I was never otf the bridge with that sh0ht exception T here vv ere at least a do¿en und a half rockets on board 1 removed from the explosive cheat two tins of bluehghts containing a doren each, and put one m each pocket 1 put them in the wheel house to save the trouble of running to the case lhere were two deck flames in a proper frame. Two rockets, and some Bifcnal flames, also two bluehghts, were left over after all the passengers had gone It is not true that tile captain asked how» man) rockets were left and that I said " only two M hat Mr Perkins said about my stating, " unfortunately it is onh too true that the rockets are all done but two is not true We passed the Clarence Heads more thnn four miles off It is not true that the captain ordered the cannon to be fired, and was told that there was no powder lo Mr Rogers -We were abreast of tno Clarence nt about halt past 4 Lvans Reef is about 174 miles further north Captain Walker, re called, said,-The Cahors had the last Marine Loan! overhaul some two months ugo She was then thoroughly ofhcially inspected in every re spect as far as the law demanded It is un true that I at any time told any person that there were only two rockets left I thought tho rockets were going out freely, and know ing that theBurwah was following, I reckoned she would be up in about five or six hours, and accordingly said " Don t expend all the rocket, reserve two or three for a pass m¿ steamer There aro such a number of lights about tho deck that she may mistake us for a bushfire There was no danger fiom the lighted kerosene on deck, as all the fires were protected by sheepskins and wet sacl in¿ 1 lie crew behaved properly, or the result would have beenverydifferent All that one man did was to cut the patent light away from one of the life buoys, as it was of no use. The ship s life buoys were all on deck on thursday, aomo m their proper places Thero is not one word of truth m the statement that I ordered u gun to be fired I should have been a madman to havo done such a thing I inspected the magazine personally on the 24th May There was powder in it We had abundance of rockets and blue lights. 11 now that we had a, surplus of blue lights on board, and also two rvserve rockets after the passengers had left A t daylight in the morning I had a blue hftht in each pocket Previous to the Hurvv ah s boat coming alongside I Bent the sturboaid life boat to the Burwoh to apprise he\ of the accident, and the boats crossed on ti e wa) lho Burwah s boat got to the Cahors Viefore our lifeboat had leit 1 he Burwah s boat asked who she was and was told, B) this time our boat carne and lay off on the stvr board bow back from the Burwah \t waa undecided then whether to commence disembarking the passen¿eis and we took somo time before we did decide I had satislied myself by this time that they would be sale on boird the vessel until dayhf lit. I did not consider it safe for the bouts to approach within 20 yards of the ship I never sind aii)thin" ol the sort (hat when the Burn ali s boil» carne alongside and asked me t > neild up it rocket I had intc,ot one M) cxrlinutun is that two beats cann from the Burn*iii Only one carlo within hill After commencing to dis emburk the pU3Hcii"in into the lifeboat and into Mr Juuoi s bolt I asked him if he ha ' an) blue liüita in Ins boat, and if so to pass one into the 1 unvali s boat, is it weuid show her position 1 con silered u imposable to throw one into the boat without the risk of losing it or (,c line, it w't 1 was up and down during the afterno m sever il times betv/ien 4 a dock mid the time when the ship struck 1 conudired the vessel lo be in sale hinds I daifiaay I muy have said to the mite or the second mate Don t nile non sense. He said, \\\ e are iiearl) up to Kvans Head nnd I replied \oucant possibly be there till after G o clock at our rate of speed " I could neither see trees nor tramuajs off the Heads even with glasses. I still maintain that we were not a foot less than Ive miles off Clarcuce Heads vv hen w o passed I asked Mr Butters to tako my seat nt the dinner table, as I would not go below until we had passed Evana Head We struck the reef 25 minutes afterwards At this time it was not light enough to see the land abreast of us. It is untrue that I was in bed at I p ni I certainly did decline Mr Perkins s offer of champagne, as I make it a rule not to drink with the pisscngers. I shaped a cou rao well calculated to take mo clear of the reef 1 waa satisfied that it would clear us. ?Something wonderful must have occurred to place the vessel in danger Any persons are at liberty to take my chart courses, distances, ic., and work the matter out for themselves, and it will be found absolutely impossible that 1 could have been three and a half miles out of my couisc when we shuck Had the course I gave beon carried out, and I believe it was, the accident could not have occurred, unless through the influence of some power nn known She must have been driven fully four miles and a hall out of her course in less than si\ miles of the distance 'J o Mr lionels -It is tuiito true that after ordering a ehunge of course I went to consult the chart 1 did this to make assurance doubl) sure I knew the rate of speed to within 15 v arila I did not personally take a four point "earing '1 his concluded the evidence Mr Rogers and Mr Want addressed the board, and the mquirj closed '1 he board w ill probably give its decision on Monck)
