Infest (telegrams. C0LQMAL~TELEGRAMS. SPECIAL TELEGRAMS. VICTORIA." Melbourne, January 27. [From our own Correspondent.] The passengers of the Mirzapore are com plaining loudly of their treatment at the Quarantine Station, and say the P. & O. Company did not pay sufficient attention to their comfort while they were kept on the steamer. The Customs officers have seized 7,000 cigars at a Ballarat Chinese store for not having paid duty; the brand and quality are exactly the same as those seized in Mel bourne. It is rumoured that other large seizures are likely to be made soon at Bseekworth, Castlemaine, and Sandhurst. The appointment of a successor to Colonel Anderson will be considered at the next Cabinet meeting. Colonel Scratchley has been mentioned, also Colonels Rede and Hutton. The Minister of Mines is making enquiries as to the practicability of erecting special magazines at'all the principal mining centres for the safe storage of explosives. The defalcations of Robert Atkinson, mining manager, of Ballarat, who committed suicide, are now estimated at £2,000. In one case Atkinson was entrusted with £500 to invest for a miner, who obtained it from dividends in various claims; Atkinson misap propriated the money, leaving the miner almost penniless. Serious bush-fires are reported from several parts of the colony. The steamer Julia Percy has had her repairs completed after her recent collision, and tc-day resumed running for the Western Ports. The weather is fine but warm.
