Racing Through Flame3. An exciting race lor life is reported from the mountains back of Santa Monica, when a bush-fire got under way and has been burning fiercely over the country for a couple of days. A young settler named Wilson, who had built himself a cabin in the mountains was asleep when the flames reached bis honse, and was not awakened until the fire almost roasted him. 'When he reached the door he thought his last day had come, ior the flames and d*=nse smoke shot np ou all sides for several hundred feet, and b.e co«ld s^e no outlet. He «was one of tl-e toughest little mustangs in the country. He tied a wet blanset over the animal's head and body, and the broucho dashed into the flames, For a quarter of a mile Wilson, who was more dead than alive, expected his horse to drop dead every step. But the mustang kept his pace and dashed into the clear space ahead of the crackling s-ea of flat: (S Wilson thought he was safe and attempted tosTcw the mm. tang up, but the norse understood '. the situation better than his master, and in spite of Wilson's eflorts dashed on. It was well he did, for in a few minutes the fire bounded across the cleared ppot and was close onjthe heels of the horse, Wilson was terribly- bnrned about the head and face aud blistered whenever the skin was exposed.
