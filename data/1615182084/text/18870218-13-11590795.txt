THE LATE BUSH FIRES IN THE COUNTRY. (By Telegraph From Our Correspondents.) BELFAST, Thursday.

Roberts, J. Leach, J. Gainor. A number of horses and sheep were burnt. It is surprising that a greater number of stock were not destroyed, as the fire was remark- ably fierce, and travelled very fast over many miles of country. MORNINGTON, Thursday. The bushfires which have been raging during the last few days have destroyed large quantities of fencing, grass, and hay, and in one instance a homestead and farming ma- chinery near to Boneo. Moorroduc, Bittern, Balnarring, Kangorong, Mounts Arthur and and Martha, have suffered severely by the ravages of tile fires, which have now been fortunately extinguished by the welcome rain that set in last evening.
