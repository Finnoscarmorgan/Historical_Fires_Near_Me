GENERAL NEWS. The weather during the past week has been distinctly warm. Though the thermometer has shown no phenomenal records it approached quite near enough to boiling point to meet average requirements. Op Sunday lust the maximum was 140? in the sun and 8!T in tlic shade, on Monday 1551t 0 in tlie sun and 9311? in the shade; on Tuesday 151 S* iv the sun and Sfi!~2' iv tho shade, and on Wed nesday Ui'JS' in the sun aud 9ti"4 J in tbe sltadt-. Yesterday the (general and unchallenged verdict of tho public was tiiat the weather was abominabk—with a variation of adjectives to suit all taste-. The clouds of dust that had taken putsession of Adelaide were reminiscent of a midsummer storm in a northern towu where roads are unformed and water is a luxury. The corporation waterearts did their best to improve matters, bul tlie task was hopeless. At about noon the temperature was lj(!i) J in tho sun and 100'j? in ct:<-shade. It was, in fact, just the sort of day which afforded oldeoluuiitean opportunity to revel in weather stories—tolti to au audience too hut to Ixs sympathetic and too dust choked to be incredulous. The cool change which the Government Astrououier iiad predicted would occur in die afternoon arrived safely— fortunately for Mir Charles's reputation as a. J prophet, as the public wen- not in a humor to I be trifled with. The thermometer fell from! VrY at uoou to 82-at 3 o'clock, and though the dubt did not entirely .settle dotvn it became less continuous. A heavy bank of ulouda arose cboui . ri o'clock, but hopes of rain were doomed to disappointment, as after a few drops the sky cleared. Tlie barometer beyan to ntae rapidly in the evening; aud Sir Charles pivdieto rough seas on the south coast and a spell of cool weatlicr for some few days- In this instance, lm donbt, the general hope will in.- tlmt t)i- jjropbtty wilJ bf .iluply verifed. At the. Observatorj" a record lias been kept extending over a lung ixriod showing the daily forecasts of Air. Wrajnje and Sir Charles Todd in rosi>ect to .South Auiitralian weather. Agamst each are three columns stating whether the prognostication was right, partly richt, or wrong. Hitheito it is gmtifying to know that our own weather prophet has au average of 84 per vent, of successes as against about 50 j>er cent, obtained by the Queensland meteorologist. Communication on the Port D&rwin; tele graph line, which was interrupted on Saturday morning between iS:mngways Sjjrings and Ooduadatta, won restored Jast niglii. As mauy thinp> of iuiportance might have hap pened in the outside world during the ebt day.s that the. service was cut oS its restoration was, naturally, awaited with great anxiety. Ksp'.i'iany was this ihe case on the Kxt'l]:'.:igt*. w.'iere Imsiues-s wasoon siderably affected by the f-toppage. Unfortu nately no as&ihtanoe; could be rendered by way of Roebuck JJaj, as the West Anstnliaa land linex were in what lias been de scribed as "their chronic state of • working badly."1 The blockade was thus effective. On Thursday afternoon Sir Charlts Todd re ceived a message from the head of the Tele graphic Department of the western colony stating that the lines north of Perth were in better order, and that they hoped to be able to assist in the transmission of cablegrams. Sir Charles Todd replied expressing the hope that everything would be done to facilitate; their dispatch. This relief, however, canie too late, as at 7.40 p.m- the Postmaster-Genera] was advised that-the Port Darwin line was once more at work. The delay in restoring communication on the Port Darwin telegraph line was caused by the fact that there were two breaks. It was at first announced that the line had been carried away at Warrina Creek—which is G33 miles from Ade laide—by floods the waters at that spot having extended over a mile in width, with a strong stream running. It was feared that the line had also been affected at Peakc River, and this surmise proved to be correct. On ilonday the break at the former place was repaired!, and parties were sent out from Warrina on one side and Oodnadatta on the other to investi gate the damages at Peake Creek. There, however, great difficulties were experienced in getting a line across as the content was so strong that both men and materials were washed away. The floods at the Peakc and Stiangways Springs were higher than they have liten since the construction of the line in 1871, and whatever precaution might have been taken it would have been impossible to have protected the line against such a flow of water. At the Peake on one dp.y there vas nothing but a dry plain on which no rain except one shower liad fallen for 15 months, but on the next day there was a stream _and a mile wide flowing over the line. There arc two means of communication, the main Port Darwin wire awl flit- railway tele phone, both of which were cut at the Warrina and Peake Creeks. Both were restored at Warrina. but on Thursday afternoon only the telephone was working at the Peake, and un fortunately this could cot be used for tele graphic purposes. Sir Charles Todd has had a very anxious time during the unfortunate block on the overland telegraph line ibis week. The floods which caused it have been the heaviest known rince the wires were erected, and they have occurred in a por tion of the colony which is very difficult of access. The railway patras through the bed of the Peake Kiver, and in one place an embankment 14 ft. high was 10 ft under water, the stream being a mile wide. The overland telegraph line leaves the railway at William Creek, SUGJ miles north of Adelaide, and does not approach it again until Alge* buckina is reached, while the next telegraph station connected with the, railway is at Oodnadatta, 737J miles north. Com municatiou from station to station on the Great Northern Railway is for the most part by telephone. The Peake telegraph-station is 640 miles north of Adelaide, and is some dis tance, to the east of the railway. At G o'clock on Thursday evening the Postmaster-General informtid us that there would then be commu nication between Adelaide and Oodnadatta, but forafault ou thotelephone wire between William Creek and the Peake. The maiu Port Darwin line, so far as was known in the department, was at that time still broken at the Peake Creek. Mr. Winter, the telegraph-station master at William Creek, who throughout the interruption of the service has shown an indefatigabib'ty worthy of all praise in his endeavois to restore the wires, was f-ariv on Thursday instructed to travel by a ballast engine, which runs on the line at about 20 miles an hour, towards Oodnadatta, taking with him the accumulated cable messages for the other side of the lvorfd, while lie was directed to speak at each telephone- station as he pro ceeded to ascertain the exact position of the fault. If the line proved dear the connection with tlie particular station was to be cut and the through, wire left intact At the some time an officer on a tricycle started from Oodnadatta with the English messages blocked there, and Mr. Winter was instructed immediately oa receiving them to return to the locality of tie fault, af he had previously located it, and to send the messages on by the engine to the telegraph-station at Strangways Springs. It was expected that Mr. Winter would reach the Peake raUVay-etation at 9 o'clock, sud that the engine would arrive at Strangways on its return journey at about 1 or 2 o'clock this morning. Not a very cheering prospect for the newspapers which had to publish the cables. Mr. Winter spoke from Anna Creek at 6 o'clock os Thurs day evening, and reported himself from the otter stages of his journey later on. Sir Charles Todd infused liis own zeal for the service into all his subordinates engaged in the delicate work of restoring communication, and while yet Mr. Winter was rapidly moving northward the welcome news was flashed to Adelaide at 7.40 p.m. that the damage done to the Port Darwin line had been made good, and that the path from Adelaide to England was clear. Only the mAst loyal and persistent efforts or Sir Charles Todd and his staff could have completed the difficult task in the time occupied, and all Australia owes a debt of cxatitude to them. He is proud of the over lend line, and he regretted more keenly than perhaps anyone else the. delay caused by the tremendous" floods of the last few weeks. Strange to say faint communication by tele phone was possible between Oodnadatta and William Crwk right through the trouble, but the sounds were not certain enough to serve for the. transmission of intricate cable messages. When Sir John Forrest, the Premier of West Australia, was in Adelaide he showed a loyal desire to defend the Government of that province from the charges of neglect brought against it by mining men and others in re spect to the telegraphic service from Eucla to Perth.' It was natural and excusable for Sir John to stand up for bis own department, but it was both cruel and unjustifiable for him to say that "there are worse breakdowns on the South Australian side of the line than on ours."' He is perfectly right, however, in affirming that ''it is the custom here to say that tlie interruptions are more frequent on our side." A curiously powerful argument against Sir John's placid faith in the infallibility of the West Aus tralian telegraph system is provided by the facte that while he yet spake the lines there ceased to work, and that they have been in a chronic state of diereinir ever since his departure The unfortunate breakage of the South Australian overland telegraph line gave the western province an opportunity of dis tinguishing itself, but, to quote the impartial authority of the Melbourne Ayr, ''the 'alter native' cable route via ltoebuck Bay and Perth .is, to far as tlw possibilities of telegraphic transmission are concerned, main taining its unchallongable record of absolute uselessness." Sir Charles Todd in response to enquiries as to the accuracy of Sir John's charge against South Australia, took a generous view of the case- It is notorious, hi; .says, that messages from the eastern colonies have accumulated at Eucla because of tlie inability of the West Australian department to copu with the rush of work. It is alHOComx^Uiattelegraiuasuppusedtobe flashing ncrws the wire in the other direction have been delayed before reaching the rjoutli Australian border. The line between Adelaide and Eucla is duplexed, but nut duplicated, and although the latter improvement will doublets come in dun course, since the adojition of the former sytftem only a few, and those very trifling, stop pages have occurred on this side of theboundary line. Sir Charles explains in mitigation oi tliu harsh criticisms liasseU on W<-st Australia by the general public in respect to the un satisfactory service on the Roebuck Bay and Ooolsurdie lines that they were both con structed cheaply at a time when it was not expected that the volume of business would be. nearly so great as that now passing over them. The operators are naturally less vxjiurt than in the eastern colonies because of their lack of practice and experience; thunderstorms, bushfires, and white ants have played havoc with the lines; and the press of messages i? tremendous. Iv one day recently 900 messages were sent from Adelaide to West Australian telegraph-stations, while the daily average is 000 messages. Tiiis proves a gruat strain on the limited resources of the West Australian lines, and to a extent excuses the delays, about which bo much irrumbling has recently been heard. Tlwj cable survice, too, is now wi heavy that the Roebuck line cannot cojie wiih the pnsont emer gency even, although, in response to a lequest from .Sir Gbarles Todd, precedence was given to press messages. On Thursday communication bctwvcu Perth and Coolgardie, which had lieen interrupted for nouie time, wad restored, and ko public resentment iv tbu cast against West Australia was K>!ne«!iat allayed, but still—and this again is a striking commentary on Sir John Forrest's disclaimer— there will be much earnestness in the repre sentations of the deputation of Melbourne stockbrokers who art? to wait oa him tu^iny to plead for the provision of greater facilities by the West Australian Government for the transmission of messages addressed to the other colonies. The information 6o far to hand in the city respecting the wheat harvest is somewhat contradictory, and as the Government have collected no statistics for the past two seasons there is a good deal of uncertainty as to the area really under cultivation for grain. It is, however, generally believed that about 1,700,000 acres were sown for wheat, but as more hay has been cut this season than has ever previously been the case it is estimated that the actual area to be stripped trill not exceed 1,C30,000 acres. A considerable amount! < of the crop that was sown is not worth strip ping, owing to the unfavorable season, and as some of the wheat land has gone out of cultiva tion most of those connected with the trade are not inclined to place the area to be stripped at more than ],(k>o, 000 acres. It is also calcu- . lated that the crop will not average more than < fire bubals to tta acre, a> that tha U&5Jj harvest will only yield about 5.230,000 bushels of wheat, as "against an estimate of 13,195,000 bushels in l&«-4, whin an average of 7 '35 bushels was stripi>ed. Then a total of 11,045,000 bubhels was available for export, but this year, when UK bushels per head of population have been deducted, together with thiw-quarters of a bushel per acre of cultivated land for seed purposes, only 5.31" ftM) bushels will be avail ; ablu for export. This estimate includes ?o allowance for animal food, and ah the practice of utilising grain for feed is coming more ex tensively into practice every year in Australia and America it is very probable tliat a con siderable amount of this year's wheat will bo used for this purpose. Sixty thousand torn, of last year's crop have not yet been accounted for, and doubtless a large proportion of this was used as animal food. The present low market values combined with the fact that a quantity of this year's wheat was either pinched by tlie wave of heat experienced in November or bleached liy the late rains, will no doubt induce agriculturists to use grain ex tensively as animal food during the coming autumn and winter. The annual Intercolonial Postal and Tele graphic Conference is to be held at Hobtut, and will commence on February L South Australia will be represented by the Minister of Education and the Postmaster-General, whis will leave Adelaide on Monday next. Among the suggestions which will be submitted to tlie conference by South Australia are:—Federal mail contracts extension, the question of tho employment of colored labor on subsidised mail steamers, Mr. Henniker Heaton's pro posal to reduce the postage from England to -d., a reduction in the parcels rate to a uniform cost, the parcels post convention with Italy, Malta, Canada, and Prance, the Australasian Postal Convention—uniform exchange of letter cards, union sea transit rates, private post cards bearing one half-penny stamps, seeds men's catalogues, the prevention of tho trans mission of obscene photographs, catalogues, &c;, the cable guarantee, improved Udegraphio communicatiou with West Australia, uni formity iii code addruves, and tho mode of accounting for reply-paid messages. The Government have not yet received an intimation from the home authorities that her Majesty the Queen has assented to tlie Adult Franchise Act, but they have made arrange ments that tlie name of the mail steamer bearing the royal assent to South Austzalia? shall be cabled to Adelaide. The date of the return of the .Chairman of die Railway Commissioners (Mr. 3. H. Smitfi), who is spending his annual leave in the eastern colonies, is not definitely known, but he is ex pected in Adelaide during the course of next) week. The advertisement published by tho Com missioner of 'Public Works with reference to the formation of the Idke Bonney irrigation scheme has resulted in many applications being received from working settlors. Several intend ingpayingsettlers have also communicated with' the department. The Minister of Education has for some time been engaged framing regulat£on& under the Fertilisers Bill, which regulates the said' for chemical manures, and he hopes to have them ready shortly. ; The Right Rev. Or. John O'Beilly, Bishop of Port Augusta, has not yet received either official or semi-official notification of his ap pointment to succeed the late Dr. Keynolds as Archbishop of Adelaide. It is satisfactory to learn that despite the depressed times and the lateness of the harvest the Crown rents are jvumng £n fairly satisfactorily. Next month, however, it is hoped that matters will assume an even better aspect, as the harvest will then have been gathered. The current number of the Government Gazette contains a list of tlie 031 medical practitioners registered under the South Aus tralian Medical Board. Of this number, how ever, many are absent from the colony, while many more are dead. The only gentlemen whose date of registration precedes 1850 and who are still living are Dr. J. H. Browne, England, 1845, and Dr. James Phillips, Ade laide, 1849. Tlie record in the case of the late Dr. Thomas Drewitt Hawfce is given as April 4,1551 The statement of accounta of the Adelaide Hospital for the year aided December 31. 1894, shorn that the amount of annual contribu tions was £1,250 7s. 3d.; 10 per cent of life contributors' subscriptions, £313 16s. 4d-; amount received by Oommissionera Adelaide Hospital, £93105. Id.; total, £1,557 13s. 7d.; the expenditure during the year was £14,013 17s. id. Tlie second round of intercolonial orielcot contests for the Sheffield Shield begins in Sydney to- day between elevens representing New South Wales and Victoria. The Sydn£ Morning Herald, referring to the impending struggle^ writes:—" It is high time that our association and players made a strong effort to get ou even terms wiih the Victorians in these contests. Of the 03 matches played they have won 29 to New South Wales 24, and of the last seven the sister colony has secured tho victory in six." Special interest attaches tothe play because it may have influence upon the hnaJ selection of the team to do battle with the Englishmen in the fourth test match atSydney next week. At a meeting of tile New South Wales Cricketing Association held on Monday it was arranged that a New South Wales team leave Sydney for Brisbane on February D, to commence the intercolonial match there on [Saturday, February 9. Word was received. tliat the South Australians would start from Adelaide on February 12, and after playing in Melbourne would come on to Sydney to open the return match against New South Wales on Friday, February 22. The Factories Act which was passed last, fiestion will be brought into operation on' Friday, February 2. The Act will only operate within the limits of tnunicipatities and manufacturing districts, but it can be applied to any other districts defined oy pro clamation, if a majority of the ratepayers who vote at a poll to be taken for the purpose dull so determine. Government factories are not exempted from its operation, but it does not apply to domestic Bervants. A factory it was decided should mean any manufactory, work shop, or workroom is which six or more per sons ore employed, and it is left to the power of the Governor to appoint such male or female inspectors as may appear to be ne cessary. Within three months after the com mencement of the Act every person occupying a factory must serve on an inspector a written notice in a form to be prescribed containing particulars concerning its situation, the nature of the work carried on there, and various other {joints, and a similar obligation rests with •'occupiers." within three months of the start ing of a new factory. All factories have to be registered, and every inspector has the power to inspect "at all reasonable times"any factory or to enter "by day" any place which he has reasonable cause to believe to be a factory. lie has also power to give mich directions as he may consider necessary for tlie bafcgu.trd of danguruua machinery ; to make enquiries respecting tho health of employes; to examine every person he finds in a factory or whom he has reasonable cause to believe to have been within the preceding two months employed in a factory, and to give reasonable directions for the provision of proper means of escape from any factor}- in case of fire. Armed with his certificate occupiers must at all reasonable times furnish the means required by an inspector necessary for an entry, inspec tion, examination, and enquiry in relation to factories. If not they will be deemed to havu committed " a breach of the Act," which to put it plainly means that they will be liable tor each offence to a penalty not exceeding £5. Factories have to be kept clean, ventilated, and not overcrowded, and no woman—"a female over 16 years of age"—or young poreou —"aboy orgirl between thcageof 13 and 16 years," or chad—" a boy or girl under the ago of 13 years"—shall be employed in a factory for more than 48 hours in one week, except when notice is given to an inspector, and then a woman or young person can work for 00 hours in one week, providing that tho overtime does nut exceed 100 hours in one year. This provisio docs not, however, apply to factories for preserving fruit or other jierishablc articles during December, January, February, March, and April. Children nut employed on July 1, 1894, cannot be engaged in a factory unless they have passed the com pulsory standard zna obtain the approval of the inspector. It will interest employes to know tliat a "woman" or "young |ieraon M shall not Ix- employed for more than live hours without an interval of at least an hour for a meal, and they shall not during any part of the time allowed lor their meals lie employed in a factory- Then notices specifying the'uours of employment have to be posted in factorius and forwarded to the inspector, and satisfactory sanitary accommodation has to be provided. The Governor is empowered to make regula tions not inconsistent with and subject to the subject to tlie provisions of the Act for tho more cfiec-teal carrying intu effect of its objects and purposes. The Government lave, not decided on the provision for inspection, but will do so shortly. The bon. secretary' to the Association of Registered Medical Practitioners recently wrote, by direction of the council of that body, to the Central Board of Health, calling atten tion to the wonderful success of the antitoxin treatment of diphtheria, as reported in recent medical journals. The association would In glad to know if the board would take any steps to hare the antitoxin manufactured here. Tho communication was taken into considcrc. tiou at the meeting; of the board oa Wednesday. The president (Dr. Whittell) I explained that antitoxin was a new thera peutical agent which is being largely ex perimented with in Europe. There appealed to be a general agreement on the part of tho medical officials at the large hospitals in Vienna, Paris, Berlin, and England that it diminished the percentage mortality from, diphtheria to about one halL It isnrepiiS-: from tb> blood of fanm. 31* poSi^S?

It might be passible by arrangement for one plant to serve all the colonies, and he thought a cooi climate like Tasmania would be the most favorable. At present the experiments could only be re garded as tentative. It is not yet known whether the remedy loses power by ace or the continuous heat of climate, but he had reason to believe that in a short time some of the antitoxin prepared in Europe will be in the . hands of Borne oC our local practitioners, • and be though*, it would be wise tc for -further information.
