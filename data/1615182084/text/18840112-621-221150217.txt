Serious Fires in New South Wales. SYDNEY, Wbdnesdat. There is mtense excitement over the fire at Bega, crowds of people from all parts assisting to extinguish it. Mr. Gee, jun., has lost 1,500 bushels of wheat. The fire is now going towards Cockatoo, but if the wind continues as at present, no further damage will be done. At Bega, since Sun day, the weather is most unbearably warm, with hot scorching winds, caused by numer ous bush-fires raging all over the district; At 4 o'clock on Monday the wind- changed to south-east, and brought smoke ingreat clouds from the coast. The sun was completely obscured, nothing being visible at a distance of 600 yards. On Tuesday the weather was slightly improved, and during the night j numerous fires were seen on the ridges, and they appeared to be raging just as bad as ever this morning. Some years ago the same thing occurred, I and taught a lesson to settlers, who hare been careful to clear all the timber from j the vicinity of their dwellings. At Nelson J fearful havoc has been played with the j grass and fencing. The chief sufferers are I William Ritchie and John Brown. The I latter gentleman had a very hard struggle to save his residence. He got upon the roof$ j and continuously drenched it with water, j At Tonja the fire is burning fiercely, and all j along to Tathra. Black Range is all 1 alight, and Bega Reserve has not escaped. A constable started on Monday towards Meringulo, to collect information for ths electoral roll, but was stopped by the fire. At the last-named place Mr Wren had a great deal of grain burned. These fires have been burning in some places for nearly a month, and this, with the heat, has caused vegetation to wither up. The whole district is looking very badly, and should the heat and fires continue much longer, water will get short. . ,
