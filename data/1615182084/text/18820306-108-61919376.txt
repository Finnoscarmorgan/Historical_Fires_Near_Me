ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE SAVE THE BANK NOTES ! To the Editor of the Gippsland Times. Sir,â€”The papers record that at a re- cent bush-fire at Warragul, a selector's homestead and household gods were des- troyed, and among them a bundle of bank- notes, to the value of sixteen pounds. May I ask a small space to point out that the practice of hoarding money, either as savings, or for investment, in bush homesteads is far more prevalent than is generally believed. It is a prac- tice that cannot be commended from any point of view. There is always the risk of fire to be encountered, and moreover, the very knowledge that cash is sometimes hoarded in the hut, has a tendency to tempt the greed of the lawless, and so ex- pose the industrious and thrifty owner to the chance of having to lose his hard earned savings, and, perhaps of being maltreated within an inch of his life, for attempting to resist the "stand and deliver" of a marauder. The remedy always available, for money can be sent through the post, is the Savings' Bank, where no possible risk can be encountered, and where deposits grow at the rate of four pounds per cent. per annum, com- pound interest. Yours, &c.;, W. DE T. TRACY, Actuary. Sale Savings' Bank, March 2.
