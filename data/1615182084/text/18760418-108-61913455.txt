FLUICEo . ,*The views of stockowners concern ingflukei are'undergoing'a change, and many men of experience," `writes the iam tobi Spectator, are now; to be met with who not'only aver that fluky country can speedily be rendered sound, but:who do. not'hesitate to -back up th`ir opinioiis by investingth'eirfoitiines in pdircliring ssuch land wheiever there isti, yting to be gained by. it, and stocking it with sheep. About two months'ago the Hyde-park estate, near Cavendish, was sold at a cheap 'figure and without; stock by the owner, Mr M'Gill, the reasons for the low price and the absence of stock being tolerably' obvious. It so happened, that just 'be-. fdi:e,the sale 'the whole area, of 25,000 acres ,or thereabouts; had been swept by .a succession of bush fires, and: 'Messrs Cuinming and Russell, the ppurcliasers, saw ho detriment in that; ' We are as sured that ever 'since 'these gentlemen entered into posasession theie': has not been a sign of fluko on'the property, and it is only fair to conclude that had the country been otherwise 'than perfectly sound the circumstance could-not have eacaped the notice of breeders of'such i experience. According to this 'it would seem that the burning of the grass is .an infallible remedy, and .it.; may be that the checking of bush.fires by the spread of settlement during tho last few yetrs has favotired the development offluke". At all events thore'i. no bottei 'eniedy' at_ present knodni thian to butiiin the whole area .'of. a run, andithien: p'ut healthy sheep~upon it.
