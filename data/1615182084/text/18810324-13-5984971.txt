COUNTRY NEWS. [BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.] (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTS.) ALEXANDRA, WEDNESDAY. A case of sheepstealing against George Webb, a selector at the Acheron, occupied the Bench all day. Two informations were laid, one against Thomas Webb, upon which Senior constable Irvine searched the premises of the defendant, George Webb. Finding by some means he had made a mistake, another information was then laid, and a summons issued. The defendant's solicitor objected to anything being said in evidence about the warrant, but this the Bench overruled, and the evidence went on this alone. One infor mation was produced, and the constable said it was the only one. The clerk of courts proved that there was another, but it was a clerical error upon which the search-warrant was issued. The defendant was committed for trial. ECHUCA, WEDNESDAY. The Bishop of Melbourne preached at Christ Church to-night. The weather is still very hot. HAMILTON, WEDNESDAY.

About an inch and a half of rain fell at Hamilton, extinguishing the bush- fires, which were previously raging in all directions. Two men have been arrested at Caramut or incendiarism.

"I hereby certify that I have this day tested by hydraulic pressure a 6in. cube of the Mount Abrupt stone and that there was no sign of fracture when a weight of 60 tons was applied ; this test being con sidered sufficient for all practical requirements. At the same time, the Tasmanian stone, from Oke hampton exhibitor Mr. Robinson, was tried and the 6in. cube from this quarry broke down crushed very badly, with a weight of 60 tons. (Signed) "W.
