NORTHAMPTON. < (From our own Correspondent.) \- The Plight Rev. Dr. Gibney and tlie Rev. E Brereton arrived here per last Friday's train from Geraldton and returned the same day. His Lordship tbe Bishop will visit Northamp- ton again shortly. Mr. J. Reynolds, the manager of the now celebrated Whim Creek Copper Mine, wlio lias been on a fortnight's visit here, returns to the mine next Wednesday, taking with liim, under a re-engagement,- some of the men wlio came down from the mine a short time ago. Apropos of a Whim Creek miner's grievance — which appeared in your Last F riday's issue under the heading, "Slight Profit," and signed "A Miner" — the numerous friends here of Mr. Reynolds read " Miner's" refreshing effusion with not a little surprise, as it is a well known fact that whilst bossing several mines at different periods in this district in " the good old times," Mr. Reynolds was a most- popuLar manager and much liked by the many men who worked under him, and I venture to say that his many friends here are anxious to see his reply to "A Miner." The summer weather appears to have broken up and there is every appearance of early rain. What with painting, coloring, decorations and repairing, Mrs. L. D. Mitchell has made the Railway Hotel look quite refreshing and inviting. The Miner's Arms Hotel also, I ob- " serve, is undergoing some improvements. , Consequent on the late bushfires, which de stroyed nearly- all the feed on the Commonage, there is much loss amongst stockownr-rs here. Poisoned cattle apd horses are to be seen in all parts of the bush. The Rev. T. Louch paid his customary visit here on Sunday last and preached in the Gwalla Church in the morning and afternoon. A good many teams loaded for the Murchi- : son goldfields passed through tbe town last week, and more to follow. 1 April 9th.
