YORK. From our own Correspondent. We are all suffering from the extreme heat, and almost in a state of collapse, and your correspondent being in a state of semi-torpidity, feels un able to do more than give you items of "news in brief." The appeal on behalf of the much pitied David Evans and his family, has been liberally responded to, and a fair sum has already been subscribed. News from Yilgarn brings reports of great scarcity of water. Fortunately, we have an abundance as yet. The season has been favourable in an extraordinary degree, to the in dustry of wheat growing. On Mr. Lott's farm, rumour has it that the yield runs to 34 bushels an acre. The discussion about the site for the new cemetery drags its weary length along. Another letter appeared in the E. D. Chronicle, questioning the wis doom of those who made the selection. A special train leaves this (Monday) morning for Perth, and is to take a fair number of visitors to the Races, and others, who wishing to escape our present great heat, journey on to the sea-side. Fresh tenders are called for the erection of a Mechanics' Institute at Beverley. As a further instance of the plucky determination of the Beverley people, strenuous efforts are being made to re- form their Agricultural Society on a new and firmer basis. A cricket match is to be played there to-day, the York men having arranged a visit, accompanied by the local brass band. Father Kelly and Father Treacy made a short visit here last week, and some of the Sisters of St. Joseph, residing at Northam, paid us a similar compliment recently. Bushfires still rage on every side. I have mentioned the great heat we are enduring, and in addition, sickness is prevalent, and many are ailing. January 27th.
