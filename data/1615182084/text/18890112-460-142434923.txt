LIGHTNING A C AUSE OF BUSH FIRES. TO THE EDITOR OP THE AUSTRALASIAN, Sir,—As doubtless you are aware, nearly one - third of the grass lands in the Liverpool Plains around Walgett and Moree, towards the Queensland border, has been burnt during the last two or three months— the cause being lightning. On our place here, about 50 miles north of Moree, the lightning set the grass on fire on several occasions. The last time we were burnt com pletely out, together with some of our neigh bours. For some time back the weather was extremely hot, and as a consequence we would have a thunderstorm, accompanied with about 40 drops to the square yard, every three or four days. Sometimes these " drops" weresuflicient to put out the lire that bad been lit, and at other times away it went, doing vast damage to stock And fencing. Now all this kind of lightning is a most un usual thing.in this district, and I write to ask if you could give me a reason in your answers to correspondents as to why this lightning has set the whole country on lire. I may mention that you could see what I under stand is called ground-lightning very plentiful at night before these storms. Would that have any connection with it? Of course the wpnthpr was vprv drv. Anolosisinc for troubling you -I dm, &c.;, LIGHTNING.
