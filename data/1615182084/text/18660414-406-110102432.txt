I ■ - VICTORIA. What may happen to a wife was shown ui the Eastern police court on Friday. A | woman sued her husband, one Charles I Frederick Siggers, a miner, for maintenance.; land it was shown that be had left her in London twelve years ago, and had come ,$o Victoria. The wife, in course of time, came in quest of him, and eighteen months agoT she came upon him in Ballaarat, and asked him for support; hut he told her he could not affoid it, and she must go to service. She did so, and then she lost her husband again, and even heard that he was dead ; wherefore * she advertised for him, hut without bringing him to book. Things thus went on till she got a clue to his whereabouts, arid found hint again on the race-course, at the last races. She then went to his house, and found & " secbrid Mi^Siggecs.", -there; and, as No. 1 had fife other place to go to that night, she sat ill a chair, and No. 2 and the husband occupied the bed. The wife refused to have anything to do with her husband now, and he was ordered to pay her 15s a week for twelve months.—HaUaarat Star, March 24. The sentence of death recorded against Ah i Toon, for. an atrocious outrage upon a Euro pean ferr ale chjld, does not appear to have had'the effect of improving his fellow-country men's morals.; Bad as the conduct of :tbe Chiuese is in Melbourne, however, it is posif tively decorous in comparison with their proceedings at Ballaarat. Here the demorali sation of female children is carried on cau tiously and secretly *, but on the " metropolitan gold-field," the Chinese seem to consider privacy as altogether superfluous. The fact is, however, their infamy is encouraged and J stimulated by European women, who pander to their depravity, and live upon the ruin of unfortunate children, whom they lure within their grasp. It is difficult to conceive anything more abominable than the disclosures made this week at the Ballaarat police court. .:it appears that there are some twenty European women living habitually at the Chinese cbmpr - and that it is one of their chief duties-to provide fresh victims for the bareih. The result is a hideous amount of juvenile de (pravity ; and it is stated that the Chiriaixien find it actually difficult to exclude the littfe wrenches, who " insist upon entering theiir dwellings at all hours of the night and day :!5"' There may be some exaggeration in this, hdt in.at least one case two Chihamenf .M^tfg debauched a little girl (who appeared/m court, with her mother), escaped becausethe child admitted that she was a consenting party to heir own ruin.. What are we to think ; the parental training that results in suckjde velopments as these ? It is the clear duty of the authorities to make a memorable :example,» not only of these Chinese miscreants,, hut <jf the still more culpable Europeans who cater for their pi^aQrirriiea fcr. ; v > x\ " A. recent arrival from the Flinders,^ «ays> the Port Denison " limes^ " reports excellent feed and abundance of ; water in thatdistrict!

The following snake story is from the Castler^aim Daily News" Snake siories have not been so.plentiful this summer is in tnany previous ones. This is, perhaps, owing to 'the large amount of land cleared last season by bush-fires. However that may be, it is certain that these reptiles have notjquite deserted us, as the following story will prove. A woman named Warne, residing a little off the road at the Five Flags, had occasion to place a large log of wood on her fire, afnd in about ten minutes after was somewhat Surprised to see first the head and then the whole body of a large snake, drawing itself from a hole in the log. She screamed, rushed out of thje #oor, and in her flight fell into the sludge channel, near the house.; Her husband,' being attracted from his work by her ^creams, made all speed to ascertain the cause, and having rescued: his better half, proceeded to deal summary vengeance on the utiwelcome intruder.
