Droughts and Floods. The following letter by Mr N Bartley appeared in the Brisbane Courier of Sept 14. The present severe drought serves to remind me me of a paper which I read 5th January 1864, before the Queensland Philosophical Society on on " Meterorology" and which led to the establishment in this colony of observing stations, till then unknown here, and as this paper, amongst other matter, contained a list of droughts and floods in south-east Australia since the year 1782, it may be of some interest to repeat that part of it now. From 1782 to 1792, Captain Flinders landed at intervals in various places on the south and east coasts of our continent, and he found traces of drought and bush fires invariably. The year 1788, when New South Wales was first settled, was a year of drought in Sydney; in 1797 a severe drought was observable at Western Port, in Bass Strait near where Melbourne was destined, forty years later, to be founded Then came a wet period, and in nearly every year from 1799 to 1800 there were high floods in New South Wales The Hawksbury River it is stated, rose 101 feet at the town of Windsor,crops were destroyed, wheat cost 80s a bushel and there was almost a famine as may well be imagined. Excessive rain ruled till 1810, when it stopped, and in 1811 water was sold at 6d a bucketful in Sydney. From 1811 till 1826 there were more floods than droughts, and the Hunter River rose 37ft. in 1820 ; but from 1826 to 1829 was the longest, continuous, and recorded drought in Australia, and 4d. a gallon was paid for water in Sydney in 1820. In 1830 came the first great flood for eleven years, and Windsor, on the Hawkesbury, was, once more, an island pro fem. After this, however, the years were moderately but decidedly dry ones, and A.D. 1837, 1838, and 1839 brought a three years drought, which almost exterminated the sheep and cattle of Australia, and dried up that great " father of waters," the big Murrumbidgee River itself, leaving the very fish to putrefy in the dry bed thereof, and any one who has seen and crossed this river in flood time, ten miles wide (as I have), can imagine what weather it took to dry it up, for the main river, though narrow, is very deep. Then came more floods after the break-up of this drought; and, in 1841, was the highest known flood in this part of the world. The Brisbane and Bremer rivers were both in flood at once, and the water rose 70ft. at Ipswich. Generally speaking, only one of these two rivers is in flood at one time, and the other relieves it of the back-water ; but this time both were involved, and the water, even in Brisbane, rose to a great height inside the commissariat, now the Government stores, below the present Immigration Depot. No subsequent flood ever rose higher than 45ft. at Ipswich, or more than 7ft. in Brisbane. Since then, and after the cutting of the bar and the Seventeen- mile rocks, they do not rise even so high. From 1841 to 1849 there was rather more rain than was wanted, but the latter half of 1849, all of 1850, and the early part of 1851 gave us another severe drought, and "Black Thursday," 6th February, 1851, " boxed" the scattered bushfires of the colony of Victoria into one vast wide blaze, before a northerly hurricane, which blew coaches, and men of-wars' rowing boats over like hats. Farms, buildings, fences, crops, and lives were lost of course. This drought broke in May, 1851, and in 1852 came a flood that swept the town of Gundagai, on the Murrumbidgee away, and drowned a score or two of the inhabitants. 1857, 1863, 1864, 1870,1873, 1875, and 1879 saw floods of more or less height in the Brisbane River, with boats rowing in Mary Street and Stanley Street, taking people out of houses in the first four years named. I869 and 1877 were dry years, 1882 and early 1883 were wet, and then after the Java and Sumatra earthquake of August 1883 came the constant evening glow and iron drought that has scarcely been broken since; the present is no doubt one of the periodic heavy droughts (like the 1826 and 1838 ones) which visit us at times, and become forgotten in the flood intervals, and it seems to be further complicated by the Krakatoa earthquake of August, 1883, on which occasion the pent-up subterranean gases which usually form a comparatively harmless vent in ordinary volcanoes became increased, and found it needful to burst up a large area of sea and land in order to find escape. Since then cholera and floods in the Northern Hemis- phere, drought and its attendant diseases in this hemisphere, have been rife. The conditions of the two hemispheres are essentially different. One is nearly all land, and the other is nearly all water. So the hottest and the coldest years of a century differ widely in the Northern Hemisphere, while the wettest and the driest years of a century vary but little there. Here in the Southern Hemisphere the wettest and driest years of a cen- tury vary tremendously, while the hottest and coldest years of the same space of time shows but a very few degrees of difference. The hottest year of a century in Europe shows the immense average of 8 deg. above the coldest one ; while 2 deg. would cover the fluctations, in Australia, of a century, in average annual temperature of any one place.
