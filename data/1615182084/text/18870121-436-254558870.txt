BUSH FIRE AT KULKI. (FEOM OUE COBBESPONDENT.) To be in the fashion, we had a buehfire on Kulki last week. It broke out near Mr. Thomas Beveridge's house, through children playing with some vestas. There was not one of the masculine gender at home when it happened, consequently Mrs. Beveridge and her daughter had to battle with the fire to keep it from spreading too fast or putting the house alight. For nearly two hours these two ladies battled with this greediest of all elements. The flames leaping around them on all sides, they persevered in beating it out with bags, although being in the greatest danger themselves should tbeir dresses catch fire. Even when they had succeeding in riceeping the fire off the house, and it sped on its course across the fields, they could hardly be persuaded by the now arriving nearest neighbours to relinquish their task and take a wellearned rest. Who says " woman is weak ? " What a gross libel! Whoever he is, let him come here and we'll convert him. As said before, the smoke soon attracted a good few helpers, and before the night was over the fire was stopped from running Bnd was kept well in hand. On the following day, however, it broke out again, and this time it travelled in real earnest, sweeping clean over Mr Beveridge's ATorse paddock, going within a few yards of the haystack—which was only saved by a miracle—and continuing its mad career into the Kulki station paddocks. It looked then very much as if a few thousand acres were going to be laid bare, but just" when need was greatest, help was nearest;" some good hands turned up at the head of the fire, and by a conpleof hours' hard "bullocking" they kept the fire from getting into the high grass, where nothing would have stopped its coursa Stumps and trees on Mr. Beveridge's Pine Ridge are still burning, and are being watched. Altogether we think about 600 acres, mostly belonging to Mr. Beveridge, have been devastated. TOBACCO LICENSES—All dealers in tobacco and cigars may be reminded that the time has passed for the renewal of their licenses, and those who have neglected to comply with the law are liable to a fine. We notice that in one town in Riverina every dealer in tobacco has already been summoned and fined for default.

The Ladies' Bracelet will be competed for (time permitting) on all days of trophy competition. STRANGE DEATH IN THE WAGGA DISTBICT. —Mr. S. Taylor, an old resident of Pomingalarna, came by his death in a rather mysterious way on Friday last. He was, it appears, with some friends at Steiner's vineyard, and was observed to leave the house without his hat. He never returned, aud on search being made it was found by his tracks that he bad walked straight from the house into the river, where the body was recovered next day. It is not known whether the deceased went into the water intentionally.
