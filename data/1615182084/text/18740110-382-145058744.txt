It has extinguished the bush-fires, and will do much good amongst the dry feed. It unfortunately did not fall more than twelve miles below Walgett, but any how the smallest donation in the aqueouB line is always thankfully^received in this quarter, especially about midsummer. To show how simple accidents arise, it may not be out of place to remark tbat a drover named Matthews encamped in the K;ulouie scrub, left the camp m lue morning to go tor ma norses, nis nre spread in his absence, and on his return his riding saddle, pack saddle and traps, were a heap of charred cinders. 4000 fat sheep are leaving Kilgowen (Digbt and YeomanB') for Sydney. 400 fat cattle are also on tbe eve of starting from this station for Sydney markets. Mr. Roscoe Doyle, of Warrina station had bis thigh broken in two places by his horse falling a few days ago. The nearest doctor was 130 miles, Dr. Leperbanche, of Narribri, who attended as soon as tbe telegraph snmmoned him. Mr. Doyle has gone to Narribri, as the dootor oonld not stop to attend him on acoount of his hospital arrange ments. . In the Police Court, a man named Neale has been charged with lunacy. Combo, the aboriginal, who ' jag- speared Peter, another blackfellow, at k - ' Gingi, was discharged from custody, after a week's - incarceration. Mr. Sparke, J. P., who waa the em ployer of Combo, did not sit on the case, but im mediately after tbe acquittal. Combo entered that gentleman's buggy, and was driven homewards. It is worthy of remark that Peter was a murderous customer, and twice recently attempted to kill other darkies in addition to this effort.
