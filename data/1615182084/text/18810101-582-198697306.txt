fere and loss of life. Two destructive fires occurred at Stawell on Thursday, one at an hotel situated at' Deep Lead, about three miles from Stawell, the other being a bush fire at a locality in tho neighbour- hood oalled Doctor's Creek. The first fire broke out in Pope's Deep Lead Hotel. All the par ticulars of this that are at present known are tnac cne names were nrst perceivea at 9 o'clock this morning. The building whiph contained eight or nine rooms, was wholly destroyed, with everything it contained, An unfortunate boy of three or four years of age, the son of Mr Pope, tho owner, was burned to death. It is thought the deceased wus tlio cause of the fire, and that it originated through hiB playing with matches. The building was in- sured for L200. The bush-fire at Doctor's Creek was first perceived at about 10 o'clock, and is supposed to have originated at Campbells Greek bridge, four or five miles from Stawell. The flames traversed all M'Kellar's ground in the vicinity of Doctor's Oreok, and also tho farms of Mr Grinter and Mr Scallan. The width of the area taken by the flames wasjabout 12 miles, the fire appearing to have broken out in four dif ferent places simultaneously. Many miles of country, chiefly grass land, have been devas tated ; but no reports of crop losses have reached Stawell, except the destruction of one hayrick. There were some very narrow escapes of. property, the most notable being Youldon's Hotel, near Green's Creek. This was principally saved by the presence of mind of Mr T. Hogan, late a wine and spirit merchant here, and who is at present on a visit. The firemen were nearly all present and a number of the police, besides about a hundred volunteers, all of whom did good service. The fire is considered to be suffi ciently subduod to render fears of a further out break groundless. A good watch is being kept on the most dangerous places.
