COUNTRY TELEGRAMS. NARRACOORTE, March 4. A lawn tennis match was played here to-day between the Mount Gambier and Narracoorte clubs. Owing in a great measure to the ex- <*> cellent play of Dr. McMahon and Mr. Benson the visiting team won easily, scoring 78 games to SO. The weather is very hot, and several big bushfires are burning in different parts of the district.
