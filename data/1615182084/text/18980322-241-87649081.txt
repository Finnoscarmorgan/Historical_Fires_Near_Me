APOLLO BAY. (Faoxi onu CORaEsPO5E)BoT.) The Government Bushfire Loan Beard, accompanied by Mr C. L. For. rest, M.L.A., visited Apollo Bay on the 18th inst. Nineteen applications were considered, two of which were refused. A sum of about Â£700 was loaned to the applicants. The local relief committee has had a great sup ply of clothes to distribute among the sufferers. Bundles of clothes were sent until the patient and long soffer lag committee had to cry "No More," as they were tired of distributing. The burnt out families are now well supplied with clothes old and new.. The Belfast and Koroit Steam Navigation Company are doing a satisfactory business with Apollo Bay. The Casino has been calling weekly and the trade has exceeded the expec tations of the Company. This regular communication with Melbourne is ap preciated by the residents. All pas sengers and cargo have to be landed or loaded in a small boat as the deuth of water at the jetty is insufficient for the Casino, The residents are agitat ing for an extension into deeper water to enable the steamer to lie at the the jetty. A public- meeting will be held on the 22th inst. to consider this matter. The output of potatoes, onions and dairy produce will be much below the estimate owing to the bushfires having burnt all feed and damaged so many crops. This will affect the trade of the Casino, as she will not have the cargo to take to Melbourne. The tender of Mr A. Costin has been accepted for the erection of a building for the Rocket Life Saving apparatus.
