MACCLESFIELD A fire of very considerable extent has been raging in the hills near Macclesfield and Battunga.. We are informed by Mr. Hurtle Fisher, who passed that part of the country on Sunday and Monday, that scarcely a fence between those two places is left standing, and trees of large size were falling about in all directions. No less than eight families on Mr. Robert Davenport's estate barely escaped in the clothes they had on, their houses being all levelled to the ground. A large quan- tity of wheat has also been consumed. Mr. Fisher also informs us that two women were killed, one being literally burnt to a cinder and the other suffocated. The fire continued to rage at the time he left the neigh- bourhood. It appears to have broken out in several places at about the same time. We hare received further particulars from a corres- pondent;â€” "I have to report that this township and neighbourhood were visited on Sunday with a most fear- ful bush fire, equal if not surpassing that of Black Thursday in Victoria. The loss of property Is really appalling; whole families thrown on public sympathy without a change of clothing or morsel of bread. These cases are not solitary but numerous. The destruction of houses, corn, furniture, fence, &c.;, is very great. I shall forward you a full report of the losses sustained by next post."
