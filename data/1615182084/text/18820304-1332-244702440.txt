Shortly before 8 o'clock on the evening in question four young men, including the prisoners, went to the stores of Hing Hie and James Ah Kat, in Little Bourke-atreet, and, it is alleged, represented themselves as Custom-house officers, and ransacked the places in search of contraband goods. In Ah Kat's store they created a great disturbance, broke open a door, and upset and examined the greater portion of the cases of goods, ostensibly in search of cigars, but being unable to discover any, and as the Chinese mustered in considerable numbers and showed signs of opposition, the intruders left hastily, and were shortly afterwards arrested at the Trades Hotel. AMONG the wills lately proved in the Supreme Court was that of the late Mr. G. V. Barry, who was at one time well known in Melbourne, where he was a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. He left Melbourne in the year 1872, and ceased to officiate aB a priest. He was married in America to a young lady who had some property in Victoria. Prior to the marriage, she had conveyed the property to a person on the understanding that he waB to re-convey it to Mr. Barry. This waB done. In 1873 Mr. Barry made a will in America, leaving all bis ptoperty to his wife, and in 1878 he made another will to the same effect in England. Some months ago he Bent to Victoria a power of attorney directing that the property in Victoria Bhould be reconveyed to his wife, but before the power of attorney was registered, Mr. Barry died. It therefore became necessary to prove the will in order to complete the title to the property. AN occurrence which took place on February 4 atLansell's No. ISO claim, Sandhurst, would have resulted in a frightful mining accident but for the combined action of the patent safety hook and safety cage. It appearB that the raining manager, Mr. James Northcote, was being hauled up, when the engine-driver overhauled and instantly had the cage and its occupant up to the poppet-heads, which are the tallest in the colony, being over lOOlt. in height. Most fortunately the cage waa fitted with a patent safety hook, and the instant the controlling thimble touched the top of the poppet-headB the hook divided, and, the cage falling, the safety catches immediately gripped the skids, the cage being kept suspended about 100ft. over the surface. Mr. Northcote was in a most alarming position, almost fearing to move leat by any possibility the catches should loosen their grip on the Bkids, in which case the cage would have fallen to the bottom of the shaft, a depth of 1,600ft. THE most disastrous fire which ever occurred in Echuca broke out on February 13, and raged for about an hour and a half, causing the destruction of eight buildings in Watson-street.

The bouses were owned as under:—Mr. Laing and Mrs. Sinclair, two; Captain Hampson, one; Captain Hill, three; and Mr. Rosel, one. The houses are all said to be insured, but few of the occupiers had insured their effects. Constable Harris and Mr. Morey are left penniless.
