? FATAL BUSH FIRES AT COLAC. Colic, February 7. A terrible busli-firo broke out yesterday about right miles south of Colac, and swept with great rapidity upon tbo township. A largo number of small selectors inhabiting the borders of tbo forest have been burnt out, and the (ire is still raging after four\x=req-\ and-twenty hours of ineffectual attempts to subdue it. A family named Turnbul), consisting of father, mother, and five children were suddenly surrounded by the flames while upon laud belonging to Mr. Standley, who wus with them. The whole party made for the dam, Mr. Staudloy carrying one of tboTurn\x=req-\ bull's children and leading another. They had to go through burning grass and among blazing trees to gnt to the water, and as they ncared it a tree fell uud killed one of the childreu on the spot. Mr. Staudloy was severely burnt, but it is hoped ho will recover. Sir. Turnbull is so dangerously and dreadfully burnt that little hope of his recovery is entertained. He sustained a frightful scalp wound also from the tree that killed the child (a boy of 12 years). Mrs. Turnbull, the mother of the family, was burnt to death, another of her childreu with her j a third child was rescued alive, but there arc no hopes of its recovery, aud a fourth is severely burned. Tbo infant child was also found dead in the forest, making four persons lulled in all, besides two who are not expected to recovcr, and two moro whoso injuries are severe. Colac is now surrouuded by thick smoke, and bush fires are visible in every direction. All the country is on fire between Johnson's coast track saw-mill aud the border of tho Colac town common. The immense fires in the forest Irrcwillipo endangered Sir Samuel Wilsjn's Corangamite station, and burnt out sovcral selections last week, and any change of wind will infallibly bring fires among tho thickly-selected laud. The small selectors on tho Colac town common, and on the borders of tho forest, are in very great dauger.
