BUNGENDORE. AN accident happened to the infant son of Mrs. Banks, of the Mulloon, on Tuesday week. It seems that the poor little fellow was running about with a piece of pointed stick in his mouth, when he fell, and ran the stick down his throat, cutting it badly. He was brought into town for medical assistance, and has since suffered acutely from the part swelling, but is now progressing towards recovery. A petition has been got up by interested persons and forwarded to the postmaster- general, praying that the new post-office shall be created on the site near the mill. The petitioners, probably thinking that the number of names attached to a petition gives weight to it, have, we are informed, got numerous signatures from Bywong, &c.; How Bywong people come to be interested in how or where our post-office is built seems strange, considering they have a mail and post-office of their own. A counter-petition, signed only by bona-fide residents of the town, within the radius of the postman's delivery, is also being sent to the postmaster- general, showing the unsuitability of the position proposed in the former petition; for it is well known to be a perfect quagmire, and quite unapproachable during wet weather or in the winter months. For several days last week a bush-fire was raging on the Gidleigh Estate, and a quantity of grass has been burned. The dry nature of the grass caused the fire to spread rapidly. I have not heard of any further damage being done. An art-union, sports, and a social are to be held on Easter Monday in aid of the funds of the local convent. At a meeting held last week the football club was reorganised, when the following gentlemen were proposed for the various offices:—Secretary, Mr. H. Laws; treasurer, Mr. Willard; committee, Messrs. H. Doyle, T. L. Coughlan, P. J. Byrne, Wm. McGrath, and F. Hazlewood. Colds are very prevalent just now and whooping-cough is still very troublesome in town.—Age.
