NOTES FROM ARTHUR RIVER [Fkom otrs Co-respondent.] The weather is somewhat unseasonable, hot days and sultry nights and heavy dews. We have had signs of the much-needed rain, but all for nought. As I am writing, there is every appearance of a change close at hand, the sky being overcast, with a strong North-west wind blowing, raisins* clouds of dust.

They shoot the horees, then drive in their herd of pigs, to demolish the carcase. It is a pity the police do not make an effort to protect the etockownecs from this wholesale destruction of useful nmimalB, which is carried on with impunity. Business is generally very quiet just at present — bo ^'^ ™».«^ ^T fh? nwiHT'! fill in the price of sandalwood|and roots, which had been the mainstay of this dis trict for some time past, especially among the working classes.
