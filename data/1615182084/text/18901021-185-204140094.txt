The last two days’ work of the Trades’ Unions Congress at Liverpool was re markable for the amount of business crowded into them, for the fact that m balloting for the Parliamentaiy committee the more extreme candi dit«s wete lowest on tlie list, and also fot the evidence showing that, as be tween the old trades’ unionism and the new, the congress was nearly evenly du ided Mi Jons Buxins’ name was thirteenth on the list, out of which only the hist ten were elected, and this position was explained by a doubt whether Mr Bukvs was quite thorough in his expressed intention to go no further on Socialist lines Mr Qoelcit, a prominent member of the Social Democratic Federation,fared worse, being relegated to the tail end of the long list. To Australians the chief interest in thepioceedings of two busy, not to say boisterous, sittings willl be in the dehate on the eight boms question. The resolution sub mitted to the congress was that “steps should be taken to ieduce the woikmg hours in all tiades to eight per day, or a maximum of 48 hours per week, and, while recognising the power and in fluence of trade organisations, it is of opinion that the speediest and best method to obtain this i eduction for the workers generally is by Parliamentaiy enactment ” Then followed an instruc tion to the Parliamentary Committee to take the necessaiy action. There were two ways of obtaining the eight hour system, said the mover. They might get it piecemeal by the various tr ide organis itions now existing, and hereafter to exist, or by the unani mous action of the congress hi ought to bear upon legislition thiough the Parliamentary committee He thought if the matter weie left to the trade oigamsations they might be no further aheid in 50 years time, and urged the congress to adopt the newei and more trusty method of pioceeding by Pallia mentary enactment , The shortening of the working day would, it was believed, be the means of providing work for thousands of unemployed, and it was fully understood that wases would not sutfei, while oiertime would be tabooed, except under special cir cumstances As soon as this was seconded an amendment was moved, “That the eight houis’ day could be best seemed by the action of the con giess and the tiade unions, iudepen dently of Pailiameut, which by its composition is antagonistic to the rights of labor ” The debate was long and lively, but it appeared that many who spoke in favor of the amendment, did so, not as choosing between two nays of getting a good thing, but as being desirous of having the eight hour system made compulsory by law. The Bntish workman believes in eight hours as a maximum, and would vote with both hands foi it provided the system was also adopted in other countries, the mdustiies of winch compete with those of Great Butain. Yet there is a strong feeling that if Britain legislated for eight houis while France, Belgium, America, Germany, and othei nations, kept to 10, 12, or more, the conse quence would be a sharp depletion of Bntish tiade, and, as a necessary re suit, low wages and much idle time, and badly as they want shorter hours, both foi their own sakes and foi the sake of thousands of unemployed, they are not piepared to compound for them at such . a pi ice A Lancashire delegate said he lepre sented a population of 400,000 engaged in the cotton industry, and the) were not prepaied to risk then tiade dufting away, and then childien stalling, till the hours on the Continent weie reduced to the same limit A Duiham delegate de claied that the pioposal fot legislation meant the dismissal of tiade unions in favor of political associations No bill could be so diafted as to apply equit ably to all blanches of industry, and as foi the coal mmeis of his county, they weie going fot a six hours’ day On the other hand it was contended that only legislation could save labor from the tyranny of the talist when trade was bad Yet anothei speaker maintained that an eight hours’ bill was impel atively called foi in the interest of public health Mr John Burns, speaking foi the motion, admitted that tiades’ unionism might do all that was needed if the ma]outy of Bntish operatives belonged to it Gnfoitunntely they did not, and it was idle foi the million and a half of unionists to talk about waiting till the seven millions of out siders weie biought into the union camp He appeared to think that the standaid of wages should be kept up, if needful, out of the geneial revenue. It was a Glasgow delegate who announced that he had *• a definite mandate fiom Ins society to vote against as tatutoiy eight houis’ and ty, as being pernicious, impiacticable, and detrimentil to the best interests of tiade unionism ” This gentleman held that if the eight hours’ system had pioved unwoikable in Ainenca there was no ground foi assuming that it would fate any better in Gieat Britain The debate was tenninated by the application of the closure, and the amendment put and lost by six votes, the numbers being—for, 175, against, 181\. Anothei amendment, pro posing that the law should only opeiate after a plebiscite of the tnde conceined had demanded it, was withdiawn, and the original motion earned by 193 to 155 It is to be assumed, howevei, that a resolution in favor of Legislative action, earned by so narrow a nnjonty, will lose some thing of its intended force and effect The leal leault is that British opeia tives aie shown to oe greatly divided on the eight hours’ question, as the bulk of those who voted for the amend ment may be taken to h ive voted also against the pnnciple, or rather against its prematuie introduction, winch would pi ice British industry at a disadvantage Among the other business tiansacted was the cat Ty ing of lesolutions against the sweating system, and mstiucting the Paihamentary committee to move the House of Commons for necessaiy legis lation, and for increasing the space allowed foi seamen by the present Mei chant Shipping Act It was stated that sailors had only 72 cubic feet, while even convicts are allowed 370 It was also agreed that agn cultuial laboreis should be organised so that they might not, in emergencies, undermine a stuke by accepting em ployment duung its continuance, that puson made goods should be kept out of the markets, and that the clauses in the Conspiracy and Piotection of Pioperty Act which declare picketing illegal should be repealed The erstwhile Nestor of the Victorian bench has passed away, and with Sir Robert Molesw orth's death there dtops anothei link m that chain (get ting wofully frul now) which connects the Victor! i of to day with the stirring “fifties” and their dazzling lights and deep shadows Tiie legal and judicial world of Victona his a record through it all of a brilliancy which cm hardly be matched in any Biitish colony, and pei naps not at all If there were the brave days of old to the gold hunter and the merchant, so | were there brave days in court when Staw ell, Michie, Molfs worth, Aspinall, Barry, a’Beckett, Ire land, and others of that ilk were constant performers on the legal stage. It is 34 years since Mr Robert became Mr Justice Molesvvorth. As he had glined respect and confidence at the bai, so he received in his judi cial capacity an amount of reverent confidence and regard which few men deserve and still fewer ever leceive. For many critical years Judge Moles vvortii stood almost alone as judicial head of the Mining Department. To him came appeals from inferior courts and points of obscure mining lavv, and they c une in shoals. In his judicial deliverances on these he really’built up the fabric of our raining lavv as we have it to and ty, and the mining industry owes to the memory of the late judge a debt of gratitude the extent of which is but faintly apprehended. It was a renmkable characteristic of Judge Molesvvorth’s opinion that it was thorough, caieful, and unimpeachably sound. One consequence is that few of his decisions were appealed against, and anothei and a better one that parties appearing before him came away assured that they had got the nicest equity and the clearest and purest ex position of the law. As time passed, on Judge Molesworth was peuna nently chosen to preside on the equity bench, and here, in view of his rate natutal qualities, great know ledge, and wide experience, ho came to be regaided as the Nestor of the Victoiian bench, an appellation the propnety of which was never disputed. Appeals against his findings were alway r s few', and of those few, some which were upheld by the BancoCouit were disallowed upon refeience to the Privy Council When he retned from the bench he was knighted by hei Majesty, but a distinction even per haps more grateful to him, was the spontaneous manifestations of regard and reverence made by the “Victorian bench and bar. Sir Robert gained the implicit confidence of all who had to deal with him, and this assurance meant not only that he would do his .best to arrive at an equitable finding, but that his “best” was something to be safely relied on. Theie have been more brilliant and showy careers than that of the late judge, and the work done by otheis has appealed sometimes greater and grander than his, but if we could arrive at a peifectly just estimate of the value of qualities and attainments such as his to a young and impulse e com munity, we might disccnei that none of all the pioneeis we honor so much left a nobler lecord than Sir Robert Moleswortii. The ceremony of formally handing over the Alfred Hill from the trustees to the commit'ee of the Juvenile md Industrial Exhibition was performed yisterday.
