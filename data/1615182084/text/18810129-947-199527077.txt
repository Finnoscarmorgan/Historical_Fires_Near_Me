MA.TTERS GOING ON AS USUAL/ Sib,— Such was the report of the Florence Nightingale Oompany'a mine, which I read in your impression of the 19 th inst. in Melbourne The proverb that 'hope deferred maketk the heart sick,' was never more fully verified1 than ' in'lthe case of this mine. Here. is: a mine second to none at Bcaconsfield, unless we ox coptthe ' Tasmania,' in point ot size of reef, apparently mado the cats-paw or scapegoat of other adjoining mines. Whon' in Tasmania, some timo since. I wns ' induced from the un deniably fine prospects of the Florence Night ingale to purchaso shares, believing that the vonturo would partake more of the character of . an investment than a sjieculation'.; and I now find week after week, month after;month, that my money has gone into an apparently hopeless sinking fund. ; Iwas sanguine enough to; think that when another body of stone w»s out, all unexpectedly , ' showing good gold ' in driving for the old reof at a lower level, that crushing iwould soon be resumed.' But that desideratum :seems to be as far off as over. I think it is plain there is a sordw looso somewhare. Oh, for a peep behind the scones. ' ' Hcin-hein— I have my: .suspicions.' 'Machinery working well : ' 'water heavy;' gratifying news certainly to those who ; spent their money in the full-blown ibolief of o return within: a reasonable time. jThis perpetual pumping of water- must, as a: i consequence, moan pumping money out of the 'pockets of those shareholders who. have not the goodfortuno tobeamong the big shareholders in I Tasmania G.M. Company, whose property we 'keep: so beautifully dry. ?' It is along lane that' has no turning. JFor myself, I will endeavour to become philosophical— hope on^arid grin and bear,, while I road of the fat dividends in the ?Tasmania Company's claim. ,.' ';.'?/?? '.,.'? I ' Melbourne, Jan 22.

Police ; .Court. — The ! Police Magistrate, H. T. A.' Murray,Esq., jpresided at.this. Court on Thursday. The .? ' only case heard ,was that in which ? : Edwin i :Henry Reading, a resident of Patterson street, complained against George Burgess ?for having used insulting language towards him, calculated to provoke a breaoh of the.peace. .The evidence of the complain-, ant ': was to the effect that when he .was; going home on Monday last the defendant met Hm at the corner of Margaret and Patterson-streets, . and said , he had come ;to. see .what he was going to. get out of the -estate. Witness asked, him what ;claimhe had on it, and he said that it ought toiaye belonged, to him, but that witness's/ father.had robbedhimout of it. Witness., ;said the place had been paidfor. once, and'; ho, had np.: intention : of paying a second time, . .whereupon defendant said ' that witness and his father were, a pair. of, vagabpnds and. robbers. ,. In reply to the defendant, witness said he gave.no provo cation. He did call defendant a liar after he had made use, of the language stated,, and told him if he were a young man he^ would knock him down, but this was after he had been called a robber. The defen dant was fined 103 and 8s 6d costs. . .

The majority of the birds will bo kept there, and liberated by degrees as they learn to feed and come for food. A few, however, will be sent to Dr Blyth, Sorell; Mr, McPherson and Mr. Carsons, of Sandy Bay ; and Mr. Propsting, of Kangaroo Point, in order to lessen the risk of entire loss from any accident. A. Vegetable Compass.— Among the wonders of the' Wild West' that have recently been discovered (says the London Daily Telegraph) is a vegetable ; compass. The American Association for the Ad-: vancement of Science publishes in its! 'Transactions' a ' report ? penned by General Abf prd. . of ,-.- the United States '. army, land treating of ^an extraordinary plant growing wild in the States of Oregon: and' Texas, the leaves of which point due north, and south,, and are . consequently utilised by belated prairie hunters as con venient substitutes for the magnetic needle. Professor Gay Meehan, who has examined specimens of Tthis ? gifted shrub at the request of the association, defines it as a' dwarf variety of the. osier,' named Silphiuni 'laciniatum. ? It is a perennial, and attains'a maximum height of ,3ft; 6in. The peculiar propensity of '.its' 'foliage is attributable to the fact that ;both surfaces of its leaves display ah equal receptivity, for! light. ' AH the other known varieties of the' Silphium class are : characterised by the presence.bn the; lower surface of their' leaves ' of from ' twice, to thrice,, as many, respiratory vessels as' are' contamed in' the upper surf ace,. '.which is) therefore, the more/ sensitive to light .'influences of the '.two. 'But both surfaces of the Lacinia tuiri are .clothed' alike with an 'epidermis exceptionally , receptive, of light, and, ac-! cqrdihgtd.' Professor 'Meehan,' the;' same instinct pf its leaves that prompts 'them*' to' require ;;ah;'equal. ^distribution' of light! upon' their' 'either, .'surface '.cajises '.them to assume a. .vertical' ppsitibni' and to point due north' and south, one flat of e'achleaf thus facing the east, .arid the rbth' of ' the west.'

A,; Grievance.— -As our; readers /are aware, there is an exterisivectrado! carried on between Sydney, and this port / in. the fruit line. It is of course highly essential that such , perishable .articles should be delivered , as soorias ijoasible,. and more particularly ,, so in -the present weather. It is, therefore, rather ; annoying to im porters when' the. steamer, arrives from. Sydney, like the Esk did !at ? seven last evening, to find that they were unable to obtain their fruit, .: notwithstanding, we understand, that the, Custom-house offi cials, as they always; are, were perfectly willingto afford every facility. The fruit is thus detained twelve or fourteen hours longer, and as it has been on board since Friday the risk is made greater, which is of no slight consequence to importers. ' , Hamilton-on- Foeth.— With regard to , the fire at Hamilton-on-Forth on Friday, by which the residence of Mr W. J. Lloyd was destroyed), we learn that the fire occurred during the afternoon, while Mr Lloyd was absent. . The only persons in the house were two women, and through the strong breeze blowing, the house, an, old, weatherboard onej was in flames in a few minutes, so that scarcely an article was saved from it, the loss thus being a heavy one: indeed for Mr Lloyd, and his family, for whonamuch-;sympathy: is felt. The cause of. the, fire , is believed; to be owing to a man burning rubbish some distance away, which caught a gorse hedge, and some flakes of fire were carried by the wind among the shingles on Mr Lloyd's. house. The shingles were as dry: as tinder, and the breeze in a very short space of time spread the flames over the whole building. Coionial Mutual Assurance Society. — In x'eference to/ an extract from the European Mail-: which appeared in our columns a few days since, on the question of surrender, value of policies issued by the , Colonial Assurance Association— a British proprietary corapany-rr;we-are requested, in order to avoid any mistakes arising from similarity of names, to state .- that the ex tract did not in any way refer to the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society in; these colonies, ? one of ' the special features of the fatter office being, we are assured, great liberality in thesurrender of its ? policies, especially as to holding them non-forfeitable while any surrendor value exists. ...... . Don Congregational Church. — The anniversary sermons in connection with the above Church were preached by the pastor, Rev. W. Riding, a short time since. The congregations were very good, and collections liberal. The tea-meeting was held in the Don Bridge stores, kindly lent for the occasion by John Henry, Esq. The young , people had displayed much taste in decorating the room with ferns, mottoes, etc. The tables were well and invitingly .spread at 3 p.m., and till 7 ' ;p.m. ; the ladies -were kept' in pretty , constant and. cheerful work.' At; 7.30 the public, meeting was held in the Church, which was well filled^ the pastor in the chair. -The Revs. J; Bennett, E. Steggall, and H. ; Greenwood,' 'Messrs Roberts and Burr, addressed the ; meeting. The choir added to the interest of the meetingby the rendering of several pieces.: .Thanks were, awarded to the ladies, who had well earned them, and to the speakers. The proceeds of collections; and-, tea amounted to £18 6s 4d. ; : ' Late Fire At: the Forth. — A corres pondent writes :— Mr J. W.

Meander Elkction.;-- -Through , the courte'sy/pf the Attorney-General we learn, that , the. writ for the district/ of Meander has been -issued. , Nominatipris/will- bQ received from the 28th inst. to the 7th February, and the' idoII will be taken! on the 12th February. A meeting 'of tho electors of tho' district was held .at Phillips's Assembly Room, Westbury, on Monday, forthe purpose of taking into consideration the representation of their district; iri the Legislative Council,1 arid a report will be found inv another column. One of the candidates announced, Me John Whitehead, was present, and addressed the electors, but the absence of the other, .Mr F. W. Grubb, caused some disappointment, and the ' meeting wasi adjourned' for a week in order to allow him an opportunity of being, present. We understand that the cause of Mr Grubb's absence, was that as he is not yet on the roll — though he possesses a sub stantial stake in the district — and as the meeting was distinctly advertised as a 'meeting of the electors,' he purposely absented himself, because under the .cir cumstances' he considered it would have been an/intrusion to have 'gone uninvited. Honesty Rewarded. — There have been 'an unusual number of cases lately of property, having been lost and/ re covered, 'by the owners, and a striking similarity in 'the amount of liberality dis played by, the, owner's to the finders. Tho latest icase is that pf: a lady's watch which was found by a child and taken to the police station, where the owner found ifc on calling to report' her loss. She asked on claiming it if there was any charge to pay, and' was informed there, was not ; that a child — whose name, was given — had. found the watch arid brought it to the police station.' The lady said she would^serid the finder soriiething, arid she kept her. word, for next day sheseritthe child, the munificent reward' of two pence ! A .well-known business man in Brisbane-street reported at ' the police station ,a few. days ago the loss of his purse, containing money and cheques io a considerable, amount, but next day! his dog found it in the yard^ where it had been thrown put amongst some rubbish. Another' case, which though it occurred at 'the end of last month' has not yet appeared in print, is that of thefind on the road near , Hobler's Bridge' of a packet containing £200 in notes1 by two lads, who reported the' find at the police station; but after sending the report to town they saw the owner,' who was a Scottsdale resident, and had discovered his loss before reaching home, searching back along the road, and restored his property to him. This loser; however, was an exception to the general 'rule, for : he ? liberally rewarded both the lads for their honesty. . ? ';'; Men's Hobbies; — The. hobbies of many men are utterly at variance with their general characteristics. A wealthy American banker recently; died who was considered a ?hard-headed man of business ~f£ mere riibriey- getter. Yet, after his death, a collection of toys :were sold for .over a hundred thousand ! dollars, which, 'he; had been , accumulating for twenty years., Scarcely any valuable scientific or mechanical' toy had been( made . in Europe of which he had not' a specimen, -but this assortmentiiicluded also .the most ;triyial of children's playthings.— 7Ariother, a citizen of Philadelphia, one of thoforernost jurists of the day, ; had a fancy for /col lecting fairy tales. - His shelves contained thousands of these volumes in eyery language. Manias for china, old brasses, and rare editiotis,are( so common airiong scholarly men that ' the incongruity of : 'the pursuit does' not strike, /us.

A large piece of timber . -which ' was in the wagon was jerked ??.?-. -forward, and chafed the flank of the off -wheeler, causing him to break into a ? '??'?? jgallop and start the whole team. The jhoraoa, dragging the vehicle on_ three ' 'wheels, proceeded some little distance along the road at a furious pace, but were ultimately got nnder control by the driver, and temporary repairs having ? teen effected, the journey was resumed. There were a good number of vehicles ' ? returning from the Carrick sale, but, ; strange to say, no collision took place; .'Later in the day a somewhat/similar ? -accident happened to a cart which was on ;-its way to Carrick, but as the wheel ? --could hot i be replaced, it was necessary to ? . \ draw the cart to the roadside, its becu ' -pants taking up their quarter^ for/the .flight in a small house in the vicinity. ?

We cannot tell what the affair has already cost, but it is a large sum, and it has been literally thrown into the sea : indeed, worse than that, for the debris has made the landing place much more difficult of access than it was originally. When will the Govern ment recognise the fact that an efficient jetty cannot be constructed there with the limited funds available for such a purpose ? The Leven is the nearest and best port for the Mount Bischoff country, and money laid out in constructing a road thither will be permanently beneficial. The Pomoe Court. — It is not often we have occasion to find fault with the arrangements in ? connection with out Police Court, but the want of punctuality in commencing proceedings on Tuesday cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed. The hour -at .which the Courtis supposed to sit is IT o'clock, and it was exactly 12. o'clock when the first case was- called on. Fora whole' hour the Police Magistrate, Clerk of the Court, and Superintendent of Police 'were kept waiting until a Justice of the Peace could be hunted up to sit with the Police Magistrate. ' There are only two days a week on which the attendr anco of a magistrate is indispensable,: and surely it is ' possible for one out' of: the thirty-four gentlemen holding commia-, sions of the; peace in Launceston, to attend for an hour on Tuesday and Fri day.

Mistaken Identity. — Our Longford correspondent, writingohMonday, informs us- of a case of mistaken identity which' hasjust cometp light in that district. -He says : — ' About two' months -ago /the body of; a man' was found'1 in the Lake River,' near 'Mr Parker's estate, supposed to bo that ' of Israel Simcpx, or as he was'' more, familiarly known as 'Big Israel.' The corpse-was removed to the Ringwbod Inn, Cressy,: and ' an inquest held' the; following day- at'whichjConstable Stubbs identified it as that of Simcox, the identi1 fication 'being-; based upon the dress and' general appearance, besides a broken' nose and the loss ; of 'tt: number of teeth from the. upper jaw ; the belief was also shared by others. A few days' ago, however, Israel made -his appearance on the town-' ship of Longford, and was to be heard in the principal' street '?' giving utterance jto the fact that ' he was not dead, but alive,' and1 quite ?? well,' having been both at the time and since the inquest residing at the other ? side pf the island.

The total value of the jewelry stolen amounted to £1500, but bnly about: £300 worth has. been recovered. In addition to the articles found in the prisoner's possession in'their original condition, and therefore capable of identification, a quantity of smelted metal, chiefly silver, was discovered, con sisting principally of watch cases that had evidently been melted down in a cruciblej and in a piece of the metal was found grit similar to the grifc appearing iii the coarse- clay 'of which a crucible found in Barry's ' -house was composed. A trunk bearing the prisoner's name in printed letters was produced in Court, from which Superintendent Coulter de posed the, jewelry produced wa3 taken, but no evidence as to where it, was found was. given, the Superintendent .; stating that the trunk had been brought to Laun ceston, by a constable ; from- Hobart,. without any letter,, or communication, whatever. A key that, had, .been.among' the property taken frpm the .prisoner at -the ., time '.?.-lot . his arrest., was 'tried in the lock '-.. of- the trunk, and fitted it, , but , as .soon as the key -? was \ pro duced, , the-: prisoner- very generously ad mitted voluntarily that the key did belong to .'., ttie ; : .trunk. .;, ,:; When . the magistrate directed the statement to be taken down he tried to, draw it back, and, said it ought not to be used against him.-i When ,asked if he had any. statement to , make, Barry told a circumstantial story : to: the effect that the property was found by him in March last, near the Scotch Cemetery, contained in portion of an old bag, and covered with rust and dirt, and that he concealed it then, and at night went and brought it away.

'.'The Secretary reported that he had received a basketful . pf . excellent cooked' meat 'from a hotel in Brisbane street 'for distribution at his. discretion, ? and had found plenty of 'applicants for it. It hadjbe.en suggested that many of the leading hotels would often assist the So ciety, in this- way if made aware that such, donations would be welcome. The Chair man reported that it was uncertain' when His Excellency SirJ. H.,.Lefr6y would visit Launceston, and It was / therefore a question whether the arrangements' for holding'the annual meeting should not be made at once; After a few remarks the matter was left bver'till next meeting;1 ' [ , -; Pleasure Excursion,.-— We; mentioned - recently thp Mrival of Mr Greene andiMr' Feeho'n, aribitrators for. the!

He says that Hume told him that the' ' old white man' related that a mutiny occurred at Leichhardt's camp while Classen was absent seeking water, and that Dr. Leichhardt himself was struck down ? by one of his own men, and ultimately died from -the : effects of th^ blow whilst under Classen's care. The: mutineers started in a -south- westerly direction with most of the horses ? and camping equipment. - The blacks subse quently reported that the men had been killed by other- tribes. Mr Dufaur adds that -Hume '?-.: further stated that -Dr.: Leichhardt's papers and instruments had ? been deposited in a peculiarly formed' cave in a hollow boulder of granite'/ and1 that ? there was np ? visible ? /entrance to. the cave until; the sand at .the base.'had been scratched. away^.. . . ?;';,- '. . -?.{? : » ; ?=..

Lightningi.— ^The. Indians of America 'have some curious ideas about thunder arid lightning. Re oeritly two Indian women were struck by lightning in the neighbourhood of Fort Bufford as they were carrying provisions: to the garrison. The Indians could not; be induced to stay near the bodies, which they thought to have become the habita tion of an evil spirit. The catastrophe was attributed to the presence of whites. Nearly all the Indians of the United States imagine thunder to be caused by the flapping of the wings of a gigantic bird, while the flashes are iron serpents, which everywhere accompany this animal. The ancient tribes of the Mississippi Valley worshipped thunder in the. form of a god, who was to be propitiated with sacrifices ; they offered him a dog when ever it thundered, or a child fell ill. This god was believed to produce fires. The natives of Honduras burn cotton seeds on the altar of the gods whenever it thunders. More Bonthern tribes do not offer sacri fices, but prostrate themselves abjectly on the ground on approach of a thunderstorm (which naturally diminishes, their chance of being struck). In Mexico, sites for temples are supposed to be indicated by the Deity, where lightning strikes. — English Mechanic. Sunstroke. — Now: that. ? the warni weather is to be expected, the following . remarks, extracted ., . from ; a pamphlet on ' Sunstroke as a Cause of Insanity^', by Dr. Manning, of the Gladesville Asylum, . may be read with advantage : '-^'Practic- ally,, sunstroke as a cause; .of, insanity' in England is almost . ^nknbwri. /' It is far otherwise in this colony. Five -per cent, of: the total number of cases are accre dited to it, and I. think 'with' good reason.

S. , Assistant-Government gep; . logist, is now (says' ; a 'Ne^ Zealand ex change): engaged -in Nelson in reexamin ing the extents arid value of the chrome' deposits ? which ?areito be fourid in ?various parts of that provincial: district. This mineral. is likely; to come. into great, proniinence, owing to the recent discovery '', in Germany of - its enormous value iri-the process of -leather' tanning. ' By the use of chrome the tanning of leather may. be coinpleted in' from two1 to1 three' weeks, ; whereas by the old process it took from eighteen months to two and a half years —indeed, to turn but the best leather seven years have been occupied.- It will thus be seen that the.ehrome. deposits in. Nelson are not unlikely. to prove j.of./im-, mense advantage not only to that district, but to the colony, at large. -The Govern ment have consented to assist in ? sending home a trial shipment of 'about five tons of chrome, and it is part of Mr Cox's, diity, to select the deposit from which this shipment shall be procured. : ;''--' The Protos -?
