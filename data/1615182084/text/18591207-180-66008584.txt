THE PASSIONS. As summer flames, which searching rise With smoke and ashes to the skies, Through scrub and forest blaze and crack, And leave the landscape burnt and black; So passions, with relentless smart, Burn blighting in the human heart : So blaze in man's distempered brain. And maddening pour through every vein. Usurp the sceptre of his will, And urge him on to deeds of ill; Till, sinking in the fiery wave, Their victim finds an early grave. Or if his frame resist their ire, As taller trees survive the fire, Yet more or less they leave their trace In furrowed lines upon his face; And in his conscience he retains The marks of deeper, deadlier stains; The dark remembrances of crime Will never yield to length of time. Remorse may sleep, but never yet Did man his evil deeds forget; Yes, it may sleep, but it will wake Before the soul its bandage break — Even though it sleep till death be past It must, it will, awake at last. Man, fallen man, mere breathing dust, Inflamed by every hateful lust, In every age, in every clime The willing slave of vice and crime, No more can check his vile desires Than wood can stay the summer fires: Then lift thy voice to Heaven in prayer, There yet is peace for sinners there — Pour out thy soul to God above. For he is still a God of love: And as the smoking lines of fire, Quench'd by the dewy night, expire, His grace shall melt thy heart of stone, And give thee feelings not thine own. The sway of angry passions fied, By faith and new obedience led, Regenerate spiritual life Shall soon succeed to stormy strife: So waving herbage, fresh and green, Repairs the bush-fire's raging scene.
