Its exhausting effect is ef' "".. towards tha end of along summer spent in town, in tile shapo of listless men and -women, enervated children, and a gonernl condition of lassi- tude whick in the woak almost appronehes to collapse. It is to these conditions that the observo, of the*1 future will trace tho sallow complexions, unonorgotic habits, and general air of ¡muser faire which wo uro sometimos assured aro to charactoriso tho future Australian race. If this were tho only result to bo apprehended, it might to some extent bo combated by suitable diet and habits of work and exorcise, though, of conrso, it has to bo romembored that it is only on tho coast that tho Aus- tralian livos under these trying conditions, nnd then only nt brief intervals during a few months iu the year. The other months, and indood most of the summor, givo us experience of a climnto as gonial nnd favourable as any in tho world. Tho high temperatures wo record occasionally are so ex- ceptional as to bo tho subject of remark. Wo have no practical know-1 lodgo of tho normal fever-heat prevailing for months at a timo.iu towns like Hong- kong, Calcutta, even Colombo, and othor places whero tho British race makos its home. In the country districts our heat is a dry boat, and not unfavour- able to exertion. Thus, when we road that on Sunday the temperature at such places as Mossgiel roachod 112 degreos ia the coolost house in that town, at Bourke upwards of 111, while Deniliquin, Brewarrina, Pilliga, Scone, nnd Walgett showed something like a similar record, wo kuow that tho figures do not express tho same moaning as they would have if they recorded a coastal or Sydney temperature. It has'to be admitted, novortheloss, that tho temperature during tho wook has boen distressingly high. The highest .ecori! which has reached us appears to be that which gavo Brewarrina as llfi degroos, though tho difficulty of getting a corroct shade in Bomo of our up country towns must be borne in mind in all comparisons of heat records. What is quite apparent, meanwhile, is that the heat of Sunday was continuod and intensified during the three days that fol- lowed, or at least up to about mid-day on Wednesday. Nor was tho high tem- perature by any means confined to the south and west. Araluen re- ported 109 degrees for Monday, Goulburn 100, Bowral 93, and West Maitland 10-1. When the break did arrive it hardly came as an unquestioned boon, for in such placos ns Bourke, Brewarrina, Coolamon, Moss Vale, and Oboron tho chango was accompanied by a blinding hurricane of dust, which, according to our Bourke correspon- dent's account, seems to havo resem- bled nn Egyptian plague of darkness. But tho really serious sido of all this is that indicated in the expressions of misgiving from the centres of the various interests we have named. It is cloar that the country ÍR in a desperate state for want of rain, and this is shown by the unanimous complaint. With bush fires of a moro or less serious character in many places, phenomenal duststorms which aro said, as in the caso reported from Wagga, to alter tlio face of tho landscape, tho continuance of tho boat and tho nbsenco of moisture, tho conditions may well cause disquiet. Wo road that at Lithgow, whero the boat followed on frosts, grass and crops h uve suffered greatly; about Grafton and Mac loay the bush-fires havo devastated the country nnd dostroyed largo quantities of foddor ; Bombnlaroported loss of grass and a short supply of water ; at Forster and Lismore tho crops and pastures have suffered ; and tho like story comos from Chatsworth Island, Paterson, Liver- pool, Corowa, and othor placos whoro the farmer or the fruitgrower pursuos his avocation, or whoro tho land is used for pasture 'J. ho samo complaint comos from tho dairy districts. At St. Marys tho milk supply to Sydney has de- creased to one-half, and at Wolumla tho milk returns aro failing and owners aro killing milkers for tho sake of their hides. From the sheep country it is reported that some of the tanks ore giving out, stock aro dying iii many places, nnd nil the signs of a trying season, unhappily too familiar to tho pastoralists, aro unmistakably in I evidence This is tbo situation which it is I hoped an early rainfall will relievo. Following upon comments in the Now Zealand Legislature upon the Pacific mail services the PostmaBtor-Genèrol of this colonv made some remarks upon the sub- ject, lie said, it is reported, that the Government viewed with, disfavour the Vancouver service, and the conclusión was drawn that this line would suffer the withdrawal or modification of its sub- sidy. Events do not appear to have borne out this inference, for tho Promior, when interrogated in Parlia- ment about the continuance of tho sub- sidy, referred his questioner to the Esti- mates, whero nn item still stands for £10,000, the annual sum contributed by this colony to tho cost of the Canadian service Unless Parliament should be in- clined to oliminato this item tho mainten- ance of the service, for tho present at least, is assurod. For it lins not only a Canadian subsidy, bul one from New Zea- land. Nevertheless, the support of Now South AVales ÍB ossential. The time, then, is opportune for considering the merits of the service and its value to this colony, so as to arrive at some notion whothor it is in the public interest to continue the sub- sidy or not. The establishment of a lino of fast steamers, designed equally for the con- veyance of mails, passengors, and freight, between the great Canadian Dominion and Australia, with ono terminal port in Vancouver and the other in New South Wales, ÍB due to Mr. James Iluddart. At his own initiative he put on steamers and instituted the service with a great deal of official and popular oncouragomont both in Canada and Australia, which presently took form in tho granting of subsidies. It wus not found possible to enlist the sup- port of the British Government, and mails wore not made up at London for the Pacific route. It was hoped that when a fast Atlantic stoam sorvico botweon England and Canada should bo established the Vancouver routo would receive favourable consideration in Eng- land. Mr Iluddart made the fortunas of this Borvico his particular object. IIo went to England, and left no stono un turnod to givo Canadians and Australians nu effectivo and rapid medium for com- mercial and political purposes, As every- body knows, the sorvico cost its foundor tho greatest sacrifices. Its ourly stages wero attended with even moro than tho ordinary percentage of acoidont and dolay, and abundant sympathy was folfc in the misfortunes of the line. Tho man who foresaw and endeavoured to próvido for tho future oxpansiou of nu all-British stoam servico in the Pacific suffered tho frequent fate of originators. Having sot tho machinory at work and Bhown tho possibility of success, ho had to yield to tho circumstancos, and tho Vancouver service, having íotriovod its fast mishaps and beeome firmly founded, passed into fresh hands. With that, however, the public has littlo concorn, The matte«; for consideration is whether the service :has resulted iu good, and whothor tho prosent and the expected development of relations botwoon Canada and Australia warrants the payment of a further subsidy by this colony. The question has to bo put in this form bo causo it is at all times contended that the payment of subsidies, whothor for mails or cables, is only contemplated as a tem- porary moasuro until the service is strong enough to dispense with these State aids. Wo presumo thoro aro few who would question the assertion that tho establish- ment of direct trado facilities with Canada is a boon to that country and to ours. As was said at the time of Sir (thou Mr.) Bowoll Mnckonzio'B visit to New South Wales, the opening of a channel through which trndo might flow* "botweon tho two great British communities in the North and the South Pacific must result in good. There waB much which wo could supply from these warmer climes to tbo Dominion, and in turn Canada could reply in kind. As hearing out this contention wo may rely upon tho figures in tho latest "Statistical Register," showing thal while in 1892 wo exported to» Canada £37 worth of goods, in 1897 tho amount was £19,340. The imports showed a largo expan- sion from £10,655 in the former year to £187,291 in tho latter. Under Sir Wilfrid Laurior's policy of proferon tinl trade with countrios affording Canada equnl opportunities, tho further oxpansion of commercial relations is to bo expected. Tho facility which our people possess for visiting Canada, niuking acquaintance with empire-making in the territories, and viewing the woudorful snonory of tho Cnnndian-Pacific railway, is also to bo countod as ono of the gains of this sorvico. Out of those facilities ol' trade and travel wo mny ox peel to derivo in timo important, advantages in tho creation of a sound commercial oxohango and of national sontimont which, in spito of tho distance botwoon us, will mako for cordial good understanding. Our contribution to the Vancouver sorvico is officially sot down at £10,000 ; and from the Postmnster-Gonoral's report for tho present year it is gathered that the not cost of the service to this colony for 1897 was no moro than £8780. Wo must con foss that this amount is actually a little largor than the not cost of tho Suez servioo as conducted by the P, and O. and Orient lines. And the o3timntod not cost for the same year of the San Francisco line was ?just upon £2000. In comparison with theso figures, tlio cost of the Vancouver service is no doubt groat. But t/ioti those services aro the upgrowth of years, and they are shared in by tho British as well as tho Australian Governments. We are entitled to supposo that as the Canadian service gots bettor estab- lished and supported tho cost will tend to decrease, as iu the older services. Tho company promises addi- tions to its Hoot, and consequently a better sorvico. All these facts will bo taken into consideration whou tho esti- mates aro before Parliament, and it may bo hoped that no narrow viow of imme- diate balance of trado or of cos|| will pre- vail, and undo tho useful work which, since its beginning five yoars ago, tho Canadian mail servioo has done for tho two commuuitios that mainly bear its expense. _ Tho offer of the Biitish Government to locate tho University of London in the Imperial Institute seems to imply a Government recognition that the Imperial Institute has failed to attain the ends for which it was established. The instituto was to liavo absorbed tho Royal Colonial Institute, hut that body declined to be absorbed, and continues to show faV more vitality than tho instituto which was to havo swallowod it. Tlio Imperial Institute from the first failed to interest the colonies, or to socuro their confidence that it hnd any useful prastical purpose It was founded as tho outcome of a loyal impulso on tho occasion of the Quoon's Jubilee in 1887, but it never succeeded in developing nny utility to justify its maintenance. Tho proposal now is to use it as a home for tho London University, that is to apply the large and stately building which at present serves no adequato useful purposo to that of housing tho groat, growing University of London, which ia not now domiciled in a way suited to its importance or its aspirations. The result shows that* the view taken of tho instituto in tho oolouios which held that it was unable to justify any claim upon them for pecuniary sup- port was tho corroct one. How far a structura built as au Imperial Institute would be fittod to accommodate a groat university which has a much greater futuro heforo it is a question for those concerned. Tho proposal will tend to re oall to Sydney people the project of taking tho City Markets and turning thom into a railway station. The idea seonis to bo that one building is pretty much like another and that if it fails for one purposo it can bo readily turnod to another. If that iu the instnnco in question proves with suitable adjust- ment to bo tho case, the Imperial Govern- ment will find itself happily freo from what lins turned out to be a white elephant, and the University of London may in timo bo domiciled in a manner commensurate with tho important work it has to do. " What is known as Tohungaism, tlio power of tho native priests or medicine mon, is spreading among the Maoris, and tho Government is taking action lo check it." So telegraphed our New Zea- land correspondent. Here we are, at tho end of what somobody called " this alleged nineteenth century," cynical, blasé, hardened, fin de siècle to our finger tins-and yet Tohungaism has to bo checked. But that is not tho worst. Tho medicino man is flourishing not in backward and woofully conservative com- munities liko our own. Ile raises his ugly front and practises his hoathen calliug in the country which so frequoutly invitos attention to tho fact that it is tho advance-guard of liboral progress. It is Now Zealand, tho nursery of rofoim, tho homo of fads, tlio nursing-mother of Stato Socialism-in a word, it is Mr. Seddon's New Zealand that nourishes Tohungaism. And now it is obliged to pause awhile froni sotting socioty right and to dovote its energies to rooting out old-time fotiohism. A tohunga amongst Maoris is tho professional gentleman who dovotos his timo to prophecy from birds aud beastB, und to tho general manipu- lation of the national deities. Ho can guard against " tho evil oyo," or ho can focus that malevolent optic on somo moro or loss abandoned onomy. Ile can mako a field barron or fruitful just as ho pleases, and who but he knows exactly how to apportion amongst the victors tho choice remains of a bakod ouoniy ? Ile can kill and, as abundantly proved by a recent instance, ho onn mako alive again tho unfortunate porson whom a rival tohunga has sent grieving into the ever- lasting shades. Ho is omnipotont and omniscient ; ho ovon knows how to prophesy about the weather and to ex- plain afterwards why tho weather did not behave us it should. And the Maoris, notwithstanding their advanced civilisa- tion and their Seddon and their other ad- vantages, behevo in their tohungas still Wheiefore Mr Seddon has dotei mined to convert them Piobably
