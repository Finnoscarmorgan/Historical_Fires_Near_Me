THE COsT or A GENERAL ELEC?ION.-The Sydney Morning Herald eays:-" Various rumoure are afloat as to the expense to which the country is put by a general election. We are in a position to state that the entire coat of the last general election was under Â£5000." We presume our contemporary means the cost to the public funds of the colony. It would be difficult to determine the cost to the candidates and their committees, all of which may be considered as no much money thrown away in the caro of an un necessary election. . Tuen Ray. W. KELYNACIK IN MELaOURNE.-A lecture was delivered on Wednesday evening inWees ley Church, Lonedale-etreet, by the Rev. W. ReKoly *neok of Goulburn. Notwithetanding the rain there was a crowded audience, and Sir James Me Celloch presided. The title of the lecture was " Christian Usefulness," and the object of the rev. lecturer was to impress on his hearers that the greatest, noblest, and in ever sense the best work in which a Christian tould enga , was to educate and save his follow men. .Bat he warned, them that, while to win men 'to Christ wrise the plainest Christian duty, it was the most difficult Chrietian achievement. The quall Sficationo to ensureo success in such a work wore numerous and complex. To .a man who aimed at idealing with the higheset intorests of his follows, of Fuall knowledge the most important was the knowledge Sof man., To save man was the grand idea that gave character to the life of our Saviour, and those who would follow in hie footsteps and aim at the moral elevation and religious culture of his follow-boings i eust hbe. filled with the same over-eietering sense of the preciousness of the souls of men. Those who .wished to do the Blater's work must imitate his spirit and his nots. Another grand characteristic avory chrietain worker should possess was the too rare quality of intense earnestoness. The same intense consuming earnestness that a man displayed In the acquisition of menoney should be displayed by the church of God for the acquisition of men. The cultivation of a spirit of love was all-important, and forbearanco, oself- denial, earnestness, and charity should be animated by an unehrinking tenacity of pirpose and effort that nothing could shake. Pooseseod of such qoalities, and an undoubting trust in God, the Christian worker could make his influence felt far and wide. He would not need Sgroat talents or great opportunities if he only used Sthe talents God had given him to a diligent improve ment of the opportunities that Providence afforded. The danger that threatened the church of chriotendom was not so much inaction as the fear lest the action a:should not be buptieed in the spirit of devotion. There was not enough of secret pleading with God. A unanimous voto of thanks was accorded the locturer on the conclusion of his address. The iproceeds of the lecture will be applied to the building Sfundsof the"Weoloyan ohurches at Brunawick and Went Melbouirno.-?lMolbourno Argue.

Watorhouse, W. Clarke, W. Curnow, and the chairman of the Goulburn and Maitland dietricts for consideration and report to tho next conference." HI?S?raonAL OAaAOE?.-A Chinaman travelling aerooa t'o bridge into Victoaria with a cartload of cabbages was the first individual who felt the re-im position of the border duties on Thursday last.

Tho treasury of Victoria was onriched by the sum of ninopence or so from a pro rata assessment upon these historical voegotables.-Albury Banner. CATo' OAnIOT 1UDEn.-On Thursday last the half caste, Edward Daley, was again brought before thbo bench. A cloud of witnesses wore exoamined and the evidence given by them was most minute and volu minous-so voluminouos that to publish it entire would takeo up thebo whole of our columns and from incessant reiteration only weary our readers. As far as we have soon or board the whole of the evidence tends to establish two point--viz., that a wilful murder had boon committed, and that the murderer or murderers must have boon intimately acquainted with the promises on which the unfortu nate woman resided. With regard to the first point there can be but little doubt, and the mass of evidence collooted to confirm it is most concluseive. With regard to tho second point the ovidence. is equally minute and conclosivo, thus ciroumseoribing the suspects to a very limited number. The fact that the investigations of the police have as yet been of littlo avail in obtaining oven direct ciroum ctantial evidence is, in patt, attributable to the extreme reticence (to the police) of persone whose evidence might be of the utmost importanoe (no matter what they tmay thinkh) in furnishing oa clue that may lead to successful results. Those peorsons who donot in every way give onnietnnco to the police in their researches are, in a manner, responsible for any future crime that may be committed, and desoerve that they should have an atroolous murderer of the character of the perpetrator of this deood at largo among thornem. On Thursday Daloy was romeranded to Friday and on that day finally discharged, the evidence being inosufficient to warrant hi, farther detention. He hnas boon incarceorated for flfty-threo days.-Manaro Times.
