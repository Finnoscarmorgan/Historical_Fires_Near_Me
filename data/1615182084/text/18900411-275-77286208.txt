OUR VASSE LETTER., — — r— ♦- ? — ; ? ; ? [From our Correspondent. ] : Busselton, March 31. I regret having to report yet another accident, which happened here last Thurs day evening. . Mr. Gale, of Fairlawn, in endeavouring to separate two cows that were fighting, broke his right ^forearm. The fractured limb was afterwards set by Dr. Cannj, who fortunately was-.atill in Busselton at the time, and so far , as I can learn the sufferer is progressing satisfac torily. Master G. Leaf, of the telegraph office, has been very ill lately, and has also been attended by Dr. Canny, who seems to be both clever and popular, and who seems to have come here just in the nick of time, when our own resident medico was absent. Mr; W. Moore, bookseller, of Bunbury, who had been to the Augusta and Quindalup mills, returned last Saturday, and on his way back exhibited his magic lantern at New Town. Many of the scenes were very good and made a capital treat for the audience, which, however, was not large, many of the settlers being absent at the Bridgetown Races. On the following Sunday Mr. Moore; as he usually does on his visits here; conducted a religious service. Mr. Finlayson, of Strelley Farm, narrow- ly escaped being burnt out the other day through a bushfire. Fortunately a number of Mr. Finlayson's neighbours were at hand, and with their timely assistance the fire was prevented from doing much damage. It is reported that the Messrs. Higgins, living up the Capel River, were sufferers to the extent of altoitt £100, through a bush fire, the other week f the principal property destroyed consisting of L'ay.arid other fodder, ete., and some outbuildings'. At a meeting of the Regatta-Sports' Co'tii mittee, held on Saturday last, the majority of those present agreed to postpone the regatta and sports indefinitely. It was suggested by some to fix the Prince of Wales's Birthday for the occasion— but the time seemed rather too remote for look ing ahead.
