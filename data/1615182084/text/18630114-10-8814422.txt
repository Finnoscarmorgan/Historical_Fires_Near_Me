BURKE AND WILLS.-Up to the present time, some 25,000 persons have witnessed the lying-in- state of the romains of the late lamented explorers, at the Royal Society's Hall. The lyiug-in-state will continue during the whole of next week. PLEUBO PNEUMONIA.-" Fleure Pneu monia" says the Kyneton Observer "is not extending much ia the Kyneton district. The cattle on the Park Hall Estate are all, it is stated, free from the disease now, and of those innoculated, though as many as twenty were ill at one time, only one of the anim√≥la died. Altogether, Mr. Hall lost only six head of catle. He availed himself, however, as soon as possible, atan early stage, of the services of a man named Bill Wright, from pear M'lvor, who inocu- lated all his cattle, and attended to those taken ill. Mr. Wright whose skill and success are highly spokeh of, has, we learn, treated successfully over 2,000 head of cattle by the inoculation process." THE WEATHEB.-Yesterday was certainly one of the most oppressively hot days that havo been experienced in Melbourne this season. At the new Observatory the thermometer recorded up- wards of lOldeg. of heat in the shade, and 130deg. in the sun. In Collins-street, at three o'clock the instrnments recorded llldeg. in the sun, and lOldeg. in the shade. The wind was from the north-east, but, strange to say, it was cool as com- pared with the heat of the sun. Had a " hot wind" prevailed the heat of the day would have been unbearable. At Adelaide, the thermometer stood at 102deg. in the shade, and 148deg. in the sun, the heat from the numerous bush-fires having had an effect upon the temperature of the air. Argus January 9.
