CORRYONG. (from our own correspondent.) Februarv 9. Tlie weather has been extremely hot until the last few days. On Tuesday a thunderstorm passed over, hut lit tie rain fell, not sufficient to lay the 'dust. Bush- fires are raging around ; the hills being completely hidden by the dense clouds of smoke. On Alonday last. William Fowler, a stockman on the Corryong station, met with a serious accident. He was driving a bull in AIr Wind's paddock, when his horse, getting its fore legs into a bog, fell, and rolled ©n him, causing severe injuries to the spine and ribs, also bruising him internally. He is in a very precarious state. Great praise is due. to ALs Wind, who, in the absence of her husband, suc ceeded ingettingliim into adray, made him comfortable, as only a kind-hearted woman knows how to do, and conveyed the un- Xortunate fellow to the station, where he was promptly attended by Dr Barnett. .. — Messrs Wright and Fitzjohn have both been wooing the electors here. John Lawson, a brickmaker, narrowly escaped death last week. While crossing a selector's paddock he was knocked down by a bullock, and but for his dog attract- ing tne animai s attention, wmcn. gave tne man time to escape, there is little doubt but that he would have fared badly. As it was, he escaped with a severe shaking. The tail of a large comet has been visible here for the last few nights, be tween 8 and 9 o'clock. It seemed to ex tend for fully 45 degrees from the horizon towards the zenith, the lower portion being enveloped in a thick bank of clouds. The stranger seems to be travelling to wards the south. Threshing will be finished in about a fortnight, when I shall be able to give you the average yield.
