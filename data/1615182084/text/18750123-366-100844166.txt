WHEEO. S (Frer our correspondent.) LAsT evening a thunderstorm passed over this neigh. bourhood. Thore was a smart shower of rain, which lasted . about hnlf-an-bour. During the storm a etringbark-treo at the corner of Mr. E. Sheehy's wheat-paddool was struck and set on fire by the lightning. The grass also caught fire, and for a few minutes there was considerable danger of the whole paddock of wheat being burnt. Fortunately the rain began to fall and extinguished the fire. A day or two of good heavy rain is much wanted, as the grass is becoming very dry and in some places very sonrce. This,.however, is to be attributed as much to bush-fires as to the dry weather. Harvest is nearly over. The grain generally is good; but the yield is light, certainly not twenty bushele to the acre-in fact, I believe that ten bushels to the acre will be much nearer the average in this district. .The thrashing-machines will soon be at work, nod then we shall know more about.it. Dairying is at a standstill. There will be very little dairy produce this season. SSanitary.-I have heoard of several cases of meanles in this neighbourhood; but up to the present time the complaint has assumed a rather mild form, the patients generally recovering in a few days. 20th January.
