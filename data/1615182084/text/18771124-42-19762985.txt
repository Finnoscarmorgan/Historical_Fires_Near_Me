BUNYA BUNYA. UPPER PINE RIVER, November 20 1877 THE usual monthly readings at the Primary School here were held last Wednesday, Mr. A. Anderson, the Secretary of the School Committee in the chair. The meeting was enlivened by a 'selection of music by Mr. E. Collins, and some good songs by several volunteers. After enjoy- ing a very sociable and pleasant evening, the chairman took down the names of the volunteers' for the next meeting (which it is thought will be more than usually attractive), and the meeting separated. It Ii unusually strange that the copious showers which have visited Brisbane of late should have passed over the Ironbark Ranges (the Bunya Timber Reserve), leaving scarcely a trace of their passage. The first really good shower of about an hour's duration experienced here for a long time fell on Sunday evening, but morals anxiously looked for; it has effectually extinguished the bush fires which have been overrunning the range during the past fort night. A propes of bushfires, many an ancient, and lordly monarch of' the forest has fallen a prey the devouring element; beating down and consuming in its destruction a great number of trees of younger growth. Many years have elapsed since these ranges have been so effectually cleared of dead wood and undergrowth. The roads have also suffered by being blocked up in many places with trees across them. What is the red tape mode of procedure to get the roads cleared ? There is no public body existing here to represent the necessities of the public to those who can take action.
