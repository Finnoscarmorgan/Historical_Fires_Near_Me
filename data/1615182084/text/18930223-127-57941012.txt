ALEXANDRA. -o (?~oI A CORRESPONDENT.) Tuesday, Feb. 23rk, 1893.. The damage done in this district lately through bushfires has been very great. I will not attempt giving detailed information as to who were the sufferers and to what extent, but may say some have lost their homes, a great many all their grass and fencing, and in several cases cattle and sheep pe rished in the flames. Between here and Marysville .I think the fire was fiercest, and many of the settlers -on that line of country. as well as in the adjoining shires of Mansfield and Yea, have been very great sufferers. The railway extension continues to-agitate us, and in a profound secret I have been told that the line is assured, and it will be one of the lines submitted to the Assembly at once-I hope so, asit would do good to the locality and' give a fillip, to trade during the constructionm There is every prospect of 'a big mining- revival at Jamieson district, some good reefs being unearthed in that once famous locality. Mining progress there will" benefit the district very much, and here some advantage must also be gained because Alexandra should receive some of the through traffic, which promises to be considerable. I hope to see the Ja mieson hoom-the people of that locality are plucky and spirited, and success in mining there will mean fortunes to many very worthy people who have clung to the place-for- years.. Fancy one -an who has become insolvent in this district has cost at least Â£6-to object to him on the electoral list, leaving aside- the other outlay. This will give 'ou some idea under the-law what it costs to purify the rolls.
