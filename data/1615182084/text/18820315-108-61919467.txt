BBIAGOLONG. (FROM OUR ow?N co.EERPONDENT.) March 14. One of our greatest poets exclaims, "There is a pleasure in the pathless words," but were he to see our woods after the effects of the recent bush-fires, his aspiration on the subject would, I have no doubt, be very much abated. All the country, including the Mlount Angus, Marathon, and Sandy Creek, North and South runs, has become a prey to the devouring element. Not a vestige of grass, or shrub, has been spared. Only in the gullies intervening is any green to be soon. All looks as clean and polished as a well-swept earthern floor, leaving it doubtful whether a great portion of the grasses can renew themselves again, so closely have they beenburntto the ground. The severity of the fire may be judged from the fact that many of the large trees of our forest have been so charred and wilted that they are not likely to revive. I do not exaggerate in saying that up wards of Â£600 worth of wattles in this vicinity alone, have boeen destroyed. Ibain is much needed, as the ground is very dry, and the grass begins to be parched up; yet, as I write, it looks like a change. The hop harvest is in full swing, and the crops, in some instances, are yielding satisfactorily. Ploughing has commenced, but the ground is very dry, so much so that, as the teams proceed, .they are enveloped in dust. Our gold mine drags its weary course along, and, on the principle of more-plus. more, requires an acquisition to the pre sent machinery, to prevent the coy metal from evading the grasp of those concerned. If things do not turn at an "easy angle" soon, as the worthy manager expresses it, the people will begin to got indifferont about it.
