Starter.—deorge Watson, Esq. It eeems but yesterday we had to record the doinge of last New Tear's Day on ' the Flemington course, and to fnmiaVi an account of otic of the most exciting finishes ever yet seen for a Champion Race, between I the two Sydney cracks, Tarragonahd Volunteer, ending in a dead heat; how the heroes of the , day came forth again, as fresh looking as erer, to do battle against one anoth^; 'proving a victory for the old horse Tarragon. This took [dace twelve months ego, and looking still further back, to the first of them sensation races^time rolls on bo rapidly, that we can' hardly realise it to be seven years since a few enterprising and sporting members of the late Jockey Club successfully carried out, and with great eclat, the bold idea firmed by them, the year previous, of having a great Champion Race open to all the world. We are all aware how the other eolonies have followed suit; and from year to year, and sometimes two in the same year, have these trials of endurance and speed of the racehorse been brought off { either in Victoria, Newt South Wales, New _Zesl*nd, or Tasmania. So far as the numbers of people assembled, and the intense interest and excitement evinced, the amount of { speculation, the number of horses contending, | and the richness of the prize given, none of the meetings have ever yet approached the ever memorable 1st Ootober, 1659; Five of these great reunions hare been held in Victoria, two in New South Wales, ona in Queensland, one in New Zealand, and three id Tasmania, New South Wales and Victorian homes appro priating the lion's share of winnings—the former five races and the latter four; Tas mania, twojand New Zealand, one. The shortest timetakento corer the' three miles was performed' tfcieyear Jby The Raib, over the Melbourne Racecourse, 8min. 88 sec., and the longest time_wa& 'ti^n byMormon in 1864, at Wagg* Wagga, 6min. 38eec.

Talt's colt The Barb, a result which onr correspondents "Paul Pry" and "Peeping Tom" foretold months ago in our columns. Punctual to time the bell rang for weighing out for the Hurdle Race, and we had a " look over" the several candidates daring their toilets, end were quite convinced' that the condition of the favourites would poll them through, barring accidents. / We never saw Yorkehireman looking better, and Mool art and Banger were quits' up to the mark. Laurel also looked as imeant it, and the Elk, as he always appears, anything but like a winner. Being thwferst event of the day, the sports opened under favourable auspices, hb the handicap /roved a remarkably good one, and the finnh close and exciting, Moolart pulling throudi under severe pressure, by a head. The Imw Tear's Gift, which followed, was coneidenM " a moral" for Smuggler. The Dane having been scratched at one o'clock, and 2 toG was more readily offered than /As the horses came from the pad take tbeir preliminaries, Smuggler, . by Mr. H. Power, certainly towered over bis more tiny but wiry antagonist, Lady Manners Sutton, under the guidance of Mr. BenniBon, and everyone but the plucky owner, ' /Dr. L. L. Smith, made sure that the bold Smuggler would be unmanly enough to keep hi front of her ladyship. However, under the most unfavourable circumstances, in the / shape of steermanship, the Ballarat running of this pair was reversed ; and although Mr. Ppwer got once to the front, through the wide running of Mr. Rennison at the first turn, the game little mare lost bo time in showing her tail to the Smuggler, and^vas never afterwards beaded, Mr. Power/doing his utmost on coming into the /Straight, hat found that for every prod/ne gave ! his horse, Mr. Rennbon's heels uptre answered with equal gameness, and the/fetter had no difficulty in the end in gefSng clear of his great antagonist, and much cheering passed the judge's^hmr three-quarters of a length in front, r*f>vmg this mare one of the very best thrfepyesr-olds ever stripped in the colonies, the'rime being 2min. 52sec., under welter wjrtphts, one mile and & half. Another pot, which was doomed to boil over, was a writing intheEesendon Stakes; Sour Grapes, although under a penalty of 101b. from her previous running, being deemed quite good A enough to keep all her opponents safe. Hav •' ing beaten The Barb, one mile, in November, fin lmin. 50see., she was adored as the great Australian " Achievement," and was readily hacked at evens against the field. The Doctor was rather behind in bringing hb youngsters to . the post} the stewards were considerate, and waited more than half an hour for them. However, two only got there in time, and Grace jEgerton was left in the middle ,of the course to look on,as the flag fell., The Doctor was not 4ar out when he complained of the unburn ess of the starts in November, under Mr. Raighran's management, as hb two went < to the front at once, and spread-eagled the field, coming in with the. greatest of ease, i Lancashire Witch first, and h L second. On i. coming to-gcnle, it was discovered that the I Witch was several poundB abort of weight, j owing to the hurried manner in which the | boys were weighed out, and the race wasthere t . fore awarded to li L, Sour Grapes getting f second place, being two lengths behind him. | 1 It turns out that the Doctor's trial previous" to ;„)■ the Ascot Vale was not Very wide of the mark | after att. Previous to the great race of the day, i the vast multitude betook themselves to their hampers and the booths and an hour was allowed to refresh the.-iqgraed man. When the bell was rung for weighing, the hill again assumed the appearance of an immense ant J\iU, and the aaddling-peddock was thronged to get a glimpse of the howes, that were being saddled in the boxes on aeooont of the heat of , fhe d|r.

The £50 Plate wound up the day's proceedings, and j Woodman and Lancer baring bee* scratched, Queen of Hearts, a very promising two-year old in Waldock's stables, had no difficulty in polishing off her opponents easily, and was bought m by her owner at the upset price. A protest was talked about as to her going inside of a post, but ended in smoke, ana the two jockeys, Puller and Hocking,, were fined for bad language at the weighing-yard.

They kept this position all the way round the first time. QroiDg along the river side the second ronnd Yorkshireman went up into fAird place, and Moolart took the lead, Barger going on second. . Coming into the straight, Moolart and Banger were close to gether, and Yorkshireman two lengths behind them.

A good race ensued along the back of the course, and on coming into the straight Mr. Power put on full steam, but was unable to head the Pitaford filly, who, answering gamely to the calls of her rider, handed the New Year's Gift by three-quarters of a length, amidst much cheering.

Short neck, set into very deep and powerful sloping shoulders. Short in the back, lengthy in the quarters, well let down, with very muscular thighs and gaskins. Capital legs to the knees and hocks and short in the cannon, with flat and wiry bone ; bis feet being flat is the only fault to be found with him. When mounted, his appear ance is that of a long, low-set, game-looking animal, but very quiet in his demeanour. In his slow movements his style is not taking, having rather high knee action, but when ex tended he gallops with a long sweeping stride. He made his first appearance at Homebush last year, at Easter, in the Trial StakeB, won by Blondin, Miss Corcebu9 second, and Blair Athol third. On the 28th April, at Bandwick, he ran in the Australian Jockey Club Two Year Stakes, but was beaten by the Fisherman colts, two lengths separating him from Budelight. On the 5th May, carrying 7et. 121b., he won the Nursery Handicap, beating Fishhook, 8st. 12lb.; Bylong, 6st. 71b.; Budelight, 8st. 81b.,- and Norma, 6st. 21b. As a three-year-old he won the Derby Stakes at Bandwick, when he was never called upon to race, vanquishing with the greatest ease Bylong, Fishhook, Blair Athol, Bude light, and Sir John. For the Maiden Plate he was beaten by Bulgimbar at the same meeting, but regained his lost laurels the following day by defeating Fishhook and Sir John for the Bruie Stakes.

At the back of the course Black Bess had got a considerable lead, followed Ijy Banker and Blueskin, the others close up. Coming to the fence next the atone wall Banker came down, bnt was immediately remounted with the assistance of one of the by standen. At the next leap Black Bess either fell or baulked, and was passed by all the others, but quickly made up her lost ground, and was again leading coming up to the water jump, which she took firet, rather awkwardly, followed by Comet and Blueskin. Comet then assumed the lead, and was firet over the log fence. Going along the river side Banker went up second, followed by Firetail. This position was maintained Until coming into the straight, when, Banker went to the' hunt, Firetail second, Comet third, the former coming in an easy winner by six lengths, Comet repass ing Firetail at the distance-post, Bloeskin, who fell at the last fence, coming in fourth.
