QE&LONG.; (FROM OUR OWN COltBESPONDENT.) TOB8DAY,JAN.14. Tho weather has been intensely hot yesterday and to-day, a strong hot wind blowing with great fury the greater paitof each day. Bus'i iires seem to bo very strong to the westward. Tha thai mometer has ranged in tho sun from 130de.r. to 142deg. ; and in the shade, exposed to tha action of the sirocco, from 105deg. to 115deg. Yi'itbiu buildings it has marked from 81deg. to ;i2deg. In cool cellars it has gone up to 71deg. in some instances. The fruit, which promised t) bo very plentiful, is likely to suffer severely fro n lho effects of the hot blasts of to-day and yes- terday; moro particularly the grapes, which, owing to the lato continued dry and warm weather, wero small in size, and deficient in I he quantity of bunches. If the weather lasts long as it is, the grape crop is likely to be seriously injured. ?\Vhea" pi omises to rise-some farmers asking as high as 63. Cd. per bushel for the new crop. The accounts from tho provinces have added muohto the causes that are likely to make wheat rise. Hay is also looking up. An old man named John Morgan, aged sixtyÂ» four years, was yesterday committed for trial for an attempt at an unnatural offence.
