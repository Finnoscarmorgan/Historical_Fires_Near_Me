The Special Club Bicycle manufactured by the Coventry Machinists Company, Limited, of Coventry, England, whose Colonial Head Offices are in connection with the Melbourne Sports Depot, is one of the finest machines we have seen. The Universal Club, made.by the same firm, is of a much cheaper class, but it is a thoroughly reliable mount. The Illustrated Catalogue of the celebrated firm containing par- ticulars of all their manufactures, including the Cheylesmore Tricycle as ridden by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, should be in the hands of all interested in the sport; we believe they can be obtained gratis from the Melbourne office.
