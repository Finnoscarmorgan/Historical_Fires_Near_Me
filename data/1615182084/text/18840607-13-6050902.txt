ON THE SANDS ABOUT LORNE. Lorne in the season is a very busy little watering place, where people worn out with the cares of business and possibly city dissi- pation, go to recruit by climbing over the hills all day to reach a waterfall, revelling for a brief period in the scenery, combined with the more material joy of tea and sandwiches, then climbing wearily home again and danc- ing for half the night by way of completing your physical prostration. If one refuses to do these things at the seaside he is shunned as an unsociable ascetic, who has been crossed in love, or is hopelessly insolvent,l both financially and socially. After break- fast some autocrat who has been invested by Nature with extraordinary muscular power, and by the company with arbitrary power in the matter of regulating the sight-seeing issues an edict to the effect that an expedi- tion is about to start for the Erskine or the Phantom Falls, and offers you a share of the pleasure and toil of the tour, the latter factor being comprised in the carrying of a lot of kitchen utensils and a half hundredweight of sandwiches-cut thick, so as to atccord with sea appetites. It is indeed taking pleasure sadly, and although social ostracism is hard to bear, so are the bill-cans and sandwiches. As you come down here for the benefit of the sea air, and for the sake of being at the sea- side, it is barely logical, perhaps, to under- take every day exploring trips into the ranges about. Anyhow, it w as by some such logic as this I persuaded myself that it was best to stick to the sea coast ; and certainly if you go the right way about it, there is a great deal to be seen there. The drive down to Lorne along one of those mountain spurs is one of the chief attractions of the trip, the scenery being a somewhat plainer and less rugged copy of the wild pictures to be found in the heart of the Otwtay Ranges further west. The first glimpse of the blue sea through a eucalyptian trellis of gold and green is worth the whole journey, and from this alti- tude it looks vividly blue. In different places along these ocean slopes we find large patches of young wattle scrub springing luxuriantly, and may conclude from this that within the last few years a bush-fire has swept across this part of the country. Wattle scrub is brought into existence by influences just the opposite of those that induce the growth of other trees. The seed of most of our forest trees germinates when a sufficiency of moisture is provided, but excessive heat is the raison-d'etre for the wattle. The black seeds, which seem to retain their ger- minating power for many years, are preserved in the mould, without being in any way affetted by ordinary climatic conditions. But the fierce heat of a bush fire cracks the hard outer casing of the seed and in the fol- lowing spring the young trees cover the land thickly, where, perhaps, for half a century the air has never been sweetened with the fragrance of a wattle blossom.
