BULLENGAROOK (FROM OUR OWn CORBESPONDETN.) TUESDAY last was one of the most oppressive days I ever witnessed in the colony. All farming operations were at a standstill, as nothing could be done with such a gale from the north. The wind blew as if it would blow its last. The groaning trees bent with the blast, while the sun's heat was almost unbearable. A great deal of the grain is shaken out of the crops, while they are greatly beaten down by the storm, which will make them rather awkward to cut. The fruit trees also suffered greatly, as they are almost entirely stripped of their fruit. The was a bush fire raging in the forest, but luckily for us it was a little to early in the season, the grass being too green for it to make much progress. Had it been a little later in the season woe betide Bullen garook, for everything that would burn would have been in ashes, as no human aid could have prevented it. The wind changed in the evenin ing and we got a cool breeze from the south followed by a fog. On Wednesday morning it commenced to rain and has rained ever since, and to-day (Thursday) while I am writing this, it has no appearance of clearing off. The M'Cormock reaper and binder has found its way into this district. Mr. R. Cantwell was the first to introduce one, and Mrs. T. Fitzgerald soon followed suit, they are both doing well. As soon as the weather clears up harvesting will be in full swing. The crops in general are light.
