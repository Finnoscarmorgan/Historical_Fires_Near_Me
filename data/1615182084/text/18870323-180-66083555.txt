NOTES FROM NEWCASTLE. From a CorresDondent. The pleasant task of recording another victory for the Wongamine Colts at. the noble game of cricket has fallen to my lot. On Saturday, tbe 19th inst., a match was played for a lunch and a cricket ball on tbe Wongamine Cricket Ground between the Newcastle Do&s; and Wongamine Colts. So desirous were the Newcastle Dons to defeat tbe Colts that they secured the ser vices of the captain of tbe Northam team and two of his best players, bnt they only came to be defeated. T-ifcM-- nr im Mm. meat was made at the way in which the Newcastle Dons were reinforced by the Northam team; bat tbe Colts, like true Knights of the Willow, resolved to do battle to the last, simply remarking that tbe honour of defeating the combined team would be greater than if they obtained a victory over those they had beaten before. The horny-handed sons of toil won tbe toss and sent the Newcastiites to the wickets first, who were all disposed of for 27 runs. The Wonganunes' followed, and although the fielding was very good they succeeded in pntting together 42; Mr. T. Doaegan making top score (18 aad not out.) New castle, in tbeir second innings, were all out for 25 runs, leaving the* plucky Celts an easy victory, which they won with 8 wickets to fall and 3 runs to spare. [The scores will appear in tbe ' Sporting Supplement next Saturday.— Ed.] The heat of the sun and bushfires has been very trying daring the past week. The usual thunderstorms are missed this season and water is becoming scare* in many places. The horses in this district are suffering greatly from the newlyim ported disease, which will be very serious if not coped with before ploughing sete in.
