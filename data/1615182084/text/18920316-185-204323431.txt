DANGEROUS MATCH-BOXES. TO THE EDITOR. —Yours, &c.;, SPARKS. SIR,—A good many of the “accidental ” bushfires may perhaps be due to the common round wax match box Bo generally used. these boxes are much longer than the. matches thnmsel ves, and, when they get tb >nt half empty and shake about in the pocket, it i 9 R common thing for three or four mutches to get crossways in the lid. A m>ui lifts the lid when he wants a light, and, aa likely as not, drops two or three of these stowaways on the ground without knowing it, Result, probably, a fire. As we cannot ex pect a smoker to open bis match-box with the same care he would use in the case of an infernal machine,.would it not be well to leeourage the use of these dangerous con trivances. “
