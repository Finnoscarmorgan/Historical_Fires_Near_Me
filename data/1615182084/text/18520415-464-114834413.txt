THE BUSH-FIRE EXTINGUISHER. (From Dickens' Household Words.) A Correspondent tells us there is only one way of conquering such a bush fire as was described in No. 75 of "Household Words :" "Meet the enemy," he says, "with a front of fire as extended as his own, in regu- lar order of battle. Let your troops advance boldly to the charge, and in a very short time not a vestige of the rapacious monster will remain. Instead of running far and near for all hands to come and help in beat- ing out the raging foe, two persons can with perfect ease overcome him. The mode of proceeding is this:—One carries a lighted stick; the other a green branch, having gone as far from their own preserves as pos- sible, until they come within about two hun- dred yards of the enemy, the first sets fire to the grass, advancing in parallel line with the approaching fire ; the second beats out the flames on the side next the preserves only, allowing that facing the enemy to ad- vance ; which of course soon brings the affair to a conclusion, and keeps matters comfortable at home." This is doubtless an efficacious application of the principle upon which houses are blown up to prevent fires in cities from having means of communicating with other houses. The willful burning, when beaten out parrallel to the advancing flames, des- troys all fuel for the dreaded conflagration ; —cuts off, in short, all communication.
