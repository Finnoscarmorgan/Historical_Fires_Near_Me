A deputation having waitod on the honorable member for Argyle, it was found necessary lo abandon the project for a publio banquet, as Mr. Deniehy'a departure is imminent. It was therefore resolved to present bim with a suitable testimonial, and a committee was formed for tho purpose of carrying out the resolu- tion, of which Mr. Roberts was appointed Treasurer, and Mr. Walker, Seorotary. _ A subscription list was opened iu tho room, and a considerable amount was subscribed.
