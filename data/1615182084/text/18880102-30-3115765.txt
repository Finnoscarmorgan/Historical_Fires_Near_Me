VICTORIA PLAINS. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) Dec. 27th. The usual Christmas weather; viz, hot wind, and smoke, from distant bushfires, prevails. The wheat harvest is going on; but I fear that many of our farmers will be disappointed with the result this year, for the crops generally are lighter than was antici- pated. A .meeting of the Y. P. Jockey Club was held at New Norcia Courthouse on the 14th Feb. It was decided that the next races shall be held on the 12th April, 1888. A few alterations were made in the programme. The V. P. Stakes will be a Handicap Swee- pstakes of 1 sov. for starters, with 20 sovs. added. A new race for two year olds is to be in- troduced, and that very unsatisfactory event, the Hack Race, is abolished. The other events remain unchanged. Cricket and athletic sports are the order of the day. A number of people assembled at the Victoria Plains Hotel and passed an enjoyable day. A cricket match was also played at the Prospect Arms - Bindoon, be- tween a local eleven and the South Plains eleven, resulting in a victory for the visitors in one innings.
