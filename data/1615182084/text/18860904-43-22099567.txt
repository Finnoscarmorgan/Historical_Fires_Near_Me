Hampdonshire Council. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1. PREsesr:—Cre. Walls. Taylor, Shaw, Mack, Walker. The newly^lectod coun cillors, Messrs. M'William and Tangye, (in adJitiun to tho councillors who had been returned unopposed).^signed the usual declaration, and took their' aeata at the Council tablo. i STATUTORY MEETING. APPOINTMENT OF CHAIRMAN. On tho motion of Cr. Mack, Cr. Taylor was voted to tho chair. _ The chairman announced that the busi ness of'tho meeting'was tho election of president for the ensuing year. —Cr.-Mtick"dlflered from tho chairman in this matter, and.-pointed out that the first business before the meeting was the consideration. of, an allowance to .'• the "president. It was an annual thing with] him to movo in this matter, and he still kept "naruinu oacit. • .an J*'»pc** **> b-- -it carried that day. Theyhad been taught a lesson recently that everything should bo done in a legal manner. He referred to tho fact that in other shires deputation expenses; and other little items, had been disallowed, and though the auditors had not.done it-here, still they were illegal payments. Ho would move—'1 That the sum of £50 be'patd' to trie president for the ensuing yoar.',' He noticed that some of thoh'ew councillors had been pledged to support an allowance to the shire presi dent, and he hoped.tlie. motion would be carried. "''.-J 1 ..-"*! ►. *■. <" .• •■" :.< Cr. Walls, was' glad tojagainbe in .tho position" to stcoud the motion. He thought, however, that Cr. Mack was rather parsimonious, and that the allow ance should ba £100. .There was no reason why the whole -of "that, amount should bo expended in the year; but con tingencies might arise which would re quire its expenditure in dispensing hos pitalities to distinguished visitors. He could agree with all Cr."Mack: h'a'd stated, but ho would like to' supplement his re marks with special reference to treating hospitably illustrious atraiigors coining to the' district^Ho-noticed that visitors were treated in a respectful' manner in" other places, and whilst heartily approv ing of the manner in which Cr. Vfelker lilledfth'o chair, in fact, he did not know it was ever better filled, or that things could havo bcon better conducted, still, in regard to; the" point of treating hospitably visitors to this district, he had boon quite a failure. Thero wan one instance in particular, and that was. in tho caso of an'important conference held in tho Shire Hall." That conference was attended by about twelve or fifteen gentlo men from all parts of.the colony,;who came here for the purpose of arranging for the distribution of thousands of pounds in couuecti'in with the disastrous bush fires. Cr. Walker was present at the meeting, but therie was not the slig test attempt at hospitality offered to those gentlemen who came to the district. Ile thought that ou an occasion of.the kind it was beneath the dignity of the Council to treat visitors in such a manner.'- -...;• 1 . The Chairman—But it was not shire busiuess. Cr. Walls contended'that the showing of courtesy should not be confined to shire business alone. Hia remarks with regard to the conference could be as strongly applied to the way in whicli tho Governor was treated by the council, although in his private capacity tho chairman (Cr. Tayhir) joined heartily in according him a recep tion. He 'referred' (o"the magnificeut reception' accorded to the colonists in England by the mayors and corporations of Great, Britain: Cr. Shaw—Out of tho municipal funds? Cr. Walls thought they were being feted at the public expense. * Cr. Mack expressed his willingness to incri'.T-e the amount as suggested by the previous speaker to £100. Cr. Shaw was - opposed to the principle of spending the shire money on matters not connected with, the shire. Did tho councillors know of any case where money voted as an - allowance to the chairman came back to the municipality 1 He con tended that if v Biim nf money were voted it must be given without reservation. As regarded the illegality of certain payments, it seemed a most extraordinary thing that they had tint been declared illegal before. The business of the shire had been carried o i splendidly without an allowance of tbe kind, Cr. Mack contended that the expenditure) on deputations was illegal, but the. auditors did not object to the items, and if they had objected ho thought the auditors would be wrong. He c mid not see for the life of him any reason for this sum of : money being voted. Cr. Walls had stated previously that be would have expended isonie of it on the Railway League, in which, he remarked, a great many did not believe. It was a great honor to be a councillor, and a still greater honor to be president, and he considered a money vote was undesirable. They had heard about the Bushfires'conference; but he did not see that the president should have been called upon to receive them. Cr. Walls was present*aud might have received- them. . Cr. Walls—My means did not justify me in going to such an expenditure. Cr. Shaw regretted it. He regarded the vote as a payment to the president for his services, lie knew where such allowances had been spent' upon lunches for coun cillors, and their horses. He would not move an amendment, but would vote against the motion." Cr. Mack remarked that ho had read of a case in which a sum of £100 had been voted to the chairman, of which £23, which was unexpended, had been returned to tbe revenue. Refercnco had boen made t<> the Shire of Mortlake. The president of that body, Cr. T. JOowling, had been as much opp'sed to the allowance as Cr. Shaw, but the auditors there had notified their intention uf objecting to the payment for deputation expenses, and to do things in a legal manner the council had voted a small allowance. _ Cr. Walker thought it would be show ing a want of confidence in the president to ask him for a return of the expenditure of the allowance. They should have sufficient confidence in. their chairman, not to ask for any account, and he should have the control of the expenditure. Unless that" confidence were placed in him, if he were president, Be would not accept it. The chairman stated that on previous occasions he had voted against the allow ance, but this year he would vote in favor of it, simply because he thought it was illegal to take the money from the" shire funds for deputation purposes. He con sidered that'all expenses for eating and drinking should be put out of the ques tion. There was" no doubt that the auditors had objected to the items-for deputations, though it did not come beforo the council. He would like, however, if the mover could see his way clear, to reducing the amount to £00, and be would voteforit; He thought £100 would be too largo an amount, . The Secretary, in reply to Cr.: Lang, stated a good many councillors paid their own expenses when on deputations. Cr. Mack said he would leave it to Cr. Tangye, whether, the amount should ba £100 or £50, as he saw that gentleman had promised his support to tho allow ance. Cr. Tangye said that his pcrsoual feel ing was against the allowance; but he knew tliat the feeling of tho rate-layers was in favor of it. Ho thought £50 would be sufficient, Cr. Mack, with the consent of tho seconder, altered the amount to that at first fixed by him, £50. Cr. l*ng aakod tho chairman for hia wlmg with regard to tie manner in which *■ »■«•••. hs* bw hTo^hk (mi' He contended that it was entirely new business and that, under tlie provisions of section 155, of the Local Government Act, notice of motion should havo been given. He held that the Council was not in ordorln discussing the question'at all, and that notice hot having been given on this allowance they had no power at all to discuss it. Cr. Mack replied that some years ago tho same objection had been raised, and thoy wens then informed that there was no more need of giving notice about this question of an allowance to tho president than there was a notice required about tlie election of president. *, Cr. Walls said it was ordinary business. Tho chairman—Tlio discussion has cer tainly bocn allowed on previous occasions without objection being raised. Cr. Lang contended- that if the allow ance were passod that day it would be clearly illogal. . Tho. Council was bound by tho Act to appoint a president, and the I regulations were laid down. The allow ance was clearly new business. Cr. Mack—lt states in tho Act that the allowance may be fixed before the election of president. The chairman—Under tlie CBUI section, I soo nothing that requires any notice of motion to be given. . Cr. Lang signified his intention of ontering his protest against the ruling of tlio chairman. • Tho motion was then Jiut to the meet ing, and carried by a majority of fivd votes to three. Tlie voting was as follows :— For tho motion—Crs. Taylor, Walls, Taneyc, Mack, M'William. Against the motion—Crs. Shaw, Lang and Walker. Subsequently Cr. Lang handed in tho following Bigned protest:—" I protest against tlio ruling of tlio chairman on the point submitted by me regarding the power of tlie Council'to grant an allow ance to the president without previous notico being given of tlie intention to pro pose such iillowahco in terms of section 155, of the Local Government Act, and clause 0 of the bye- laws." .- V ELECTION OF PRESIDENT. Cr. Laug referred at some length to tho excellent conduct of tho business of tha Council by the roiiring president, and movedr-" That Councillor Walker bo elected as chairman of the municipality for the coming year." Cr. Walla seconded the motion. Cr. Walker, whilst thanking the council for the compliment paid to him, expressed his wish to see a little departure from the usual: custom this timo. He thought it would be better if thero was a change mora frequently, and that councillors tn their turn were elected to the position. Ho felt very much the kindly feeling awarded to bin. and the support he had received from councillors on all occasions. The motion was carried unanimously. Tho president-elect, on taking his posi tion in the chair, returned his thanks to the council for his unanimous re-election. He would endeavor to give tbe .'same amount of satisfaction as in tho psst.
