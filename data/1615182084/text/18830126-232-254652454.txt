DESTRUCTIVE BUSH-FIRE. One of the most disastrous fires which have occurred in the Colac district took place on Tuesday, at Messrs Robertson Bros.' estate, resulting in great loss of property. Two men in the employ of the firm were engaged mustering sheep in a paddock, when they observed a large fire, which seemed to spring up directly in front of the flock they had gathered. The men at once endeavored to subdue the flames, but it was soon apparent that, unaided, there was no possibility of their mastering the fire, which extended rapidly. Assistance was sought and promptly rendered by several gentlemen in the neighborhood, while the station hands also rushed to the spot and strove to get the fire under. About an hour after its out- break the wall of fire presented an unbroken line 300 yards wide, and raging furiously from end to end of the enclosure. Despite the intense heat the men worked manfully, and after two hours' incessant toil succeeded in extinguishing the flames. The fire destroyed about half a mile of fencing, a large quantity of grass, and most of the trees in the fine plantation. The total loss is estimated at £1000. The origin of the fire is not known. —Argus.
