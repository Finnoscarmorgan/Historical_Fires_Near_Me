JONEE JUNCTION. MONDAY, February 27. (FROM OUB l OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Unhappily I have to record more bush-fires in the neighbourhood. This day fortnight a fire broke out on Mr. J. Dillon's property, and burnt all that remained from a recent fire of Mr. Dillon's grass ; but not content with burning the above-mentioned person clean out, it swept along to Messrs. Guilter Bros.'s estate, and before it was got under consumed About 2000 acres of grass thereon. It also burnt a considerable amount of grass on Wantabadgery. On laBt Monday it again broke out; this time Mrs.' Heffennan, of Rose Green, was the sufferer, all her town property .being completely destroyed ; and although a great force of men mustered up, the grass, which was between 3ft. and 4ft. high, burnt at the rate of about 30 miles an hour, and it was with considerable difficulty the fire was stopped at the main road. A serious accident happened to Mr. Mooney (proprietor of the Southern Gross) on Sunday week. It appears that Mr. Mooney, accompanied by Dr. Kavanaugh and his daughter, a little girl three years old, went to view the bush-fire referred to above, and while returning to Junee the horse, which is a very touchy animal, bolted, upsetting the vehicle and throwing the occupants violently to the ground. Three of Mr. Moouey's ribs were'broken, in addition to which he sustained'several other bruises. Dr. Kavanaugh escaped almost scathless. His daughter, however, was not so fortunate, as she received a severe gash from the eye to the crown of her head. Alderman Dobbyns has been elected to the post of Mayor of Junee in place of Mayor Humphrys (resigned). On Thursday evening we had a few nice showers of rain, amounting in all to about half an inch.
