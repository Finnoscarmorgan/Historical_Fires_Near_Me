DESTRUCTIVE BUSH FIRES. [BY TELEGRAPH.] (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTS .) INGLEWOOD, MONDAY. The weather has been very hot during the last three days. Several bush fires have been burning. A light shower of rain fell this evening, and there are indications of a change. KILMORE, MONDAY. Several bush fires have been raging in this district during last week, and yesterday one broke out in the hospital paddock, doing con- siderable damage to fences and grass. PORT ALBERT, MONDAY. Bush fires raged in this district with con- siderable violence during the whole of yester- day afternoon. The excessively warm weather, with a stiff breeze from the northward for several hours, rendered the spread of the flames over dry scrub and parched grass land more than usually rapid, even at this dry season of the year. At Won Won, about five miles from Yarram, a house was burned to the ground, notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of a number of residents in the vici- nity to keep the fire clear of the building. The house and land had been sold a few weeks previously, the previous owner, Mr. David Williamson, having removed to Port Albert with his wife and family only a few days ago. At present the weather is cloudy, and becoming cooler, with the wind from the south, but unless a fall of rain occurs this evening, of which there is some prospect, it is feared that further damage will be caused by the fires, the grass being everywhere abundant. ST. ARNAUD, MONDAY. A bush fire occurred at Gre Gre yesterday afternoon. It was caused by a local farmer engaged in clearing operations, and destroyed several miles of selectors' fences and many hundred acres of grass.
