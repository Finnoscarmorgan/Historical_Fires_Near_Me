C0RRY0NG. (FBOM OUB OWN COBBESPONDENT.) MONDAY, December 10. Bush-fires are again raging in the hills around Cudgewa and Nariel Some of the selectors have lost all their grass, which means money just now ; others have had a quantity of fencing destroyed, and nearly all have lost considerable time by having to watch the fire day and night to prevent it stealing in on their holdings. Any persons owning dogs which they value would do well to keep them on the chain just now.

The latter gentleman is often prevented by other duties from attending the court, consequently anyone having busineES there has to go quietly home and return at a more convenient seasonâ€”for the magistrates. Petitions were forwarded to the Minister of Justice some time ago, praying for the appointment of one or two additional magistrates, but as yet no appointment has been made, and the old state of things is allowed to go on. The Gordon Tent of Reohabites, Cudgewa, are using every endeavor to make their anniversary celebration, which takes place on Boring Day, a success in every way ; and judging from the way nominations for the day's sports have filled in, and the excellent programme prepared for the concert at night, I think that with good weather they will achieve the success they deserve. A procession of Rechabites and Oddfellows, in regalia, opens the day's proceedinga
