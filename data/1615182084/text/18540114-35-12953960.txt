VICTORIA. ยก We have advices from Port Phillip to the 10th. I The papers contain little news. In its review of the New Constitution scheme, the daily press agrees in condemning the proposed exclusive qualification for members of the Upper House, I arguing that it would result in creating a vicious kind of governing class, which would be the embodiment of wealth and not of worth. The papers speak favourably of a letter addressed to them by Dr. Smith, of the Sydney University, conveying the result of his analyses of the water from the Plenty and the Yarra ; from which it appears that the latter is far superior in quality. In consequence, the scheme for getting a supply from the Plenty is condemned, and Mr. King's proposal to pump up water from the Yarra, at a point opposite Dight's Mill, into a reservoir at the top of the high land, is spoken of favour- ably. , A correspondent of the Argus calls attention to the danger of using Lewis's fly poison. The poison killed the flies, but his fowls eating thom were themselves poisoned. He therefore cautions the public against the obvious danger of consuming poisonous poultry. From the state of the weather it was feared that bushfires would prevail extensively.
