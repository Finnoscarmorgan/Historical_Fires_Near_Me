GIKGIN. From a Correspondent. Our annual visitants, bush-fires, have been furiously driving their igneous chariots through tbe district during tbe last fortnight, causing mnrh unpleasant ness from tbe atmosphere which surrounds them and their suites. Tbe surveyors, apparently penetrating tbe dark vistas of the future, are busy laying out the totvnsite, the area of which falls little short of that of London. It is to be hoped they will, with their usual sagacity, reserve a suitable spot for a central aud branch railway station. If official notice ou the occasion of tbe Duke's visit were given to tbe other districts, we, as Her Majesty's liege subjects, bare reason to be piqued at being omitted in tbe programme. We hope, nevertheless, that be was satisfactorily received tuid entertained â€” that he did not sail from tbe colony to tbe tune of ' I'll gang nae mair to yon town,' aud that the other colonies shall uot find occasion to hold iudignation meetings, expressive of their abhorrence of tbe treat ment which he received in tbis colony. Notwithstanding tbe little jealousies which now and again occur among the families Smith, Brown, Jones, aud Robinson, about forty-acre blocks, tillage leases, cattle runs, &cs; we get along very quietly in tbis retired part of the world. Our spiritual interest is pretty well attended to. The caaplain holds three services each Sunday, except when he is unavoidably absent on duty at the Moore River. A minister of the Wesleyan denomination performs the duties of his calling once a month. A Sunday School is being established, and tbe building of a Wesleyan Chapel is in contemplation. If State Aid be withdrawn, it is questionable whether we may be able to keep up to our present standard. February 27.
