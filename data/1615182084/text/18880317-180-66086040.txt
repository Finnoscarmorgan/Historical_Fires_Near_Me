NOTES FROM BUSSELT0N. (From our own Correspondent) I notice that in setting my last letter you have made it appear, in referring to the death of Mr. Scott, that I sent you a telegram shortly before it took place. It should have been shortly after it took place ; it was also made to appear that Mr. T. Higgins shouted to his mother to look after the sheep ,- it should have read be shouted to his brother. The funeral of the unfor tunate man took place on Sunday after noon, and, as I anticipated in my last, was a very huge one, over 200 following. Amongst the number I noticed our M.L.C (Mr. Layman), Mr. Yelverton, the mem bers of the B.M.C., and a great many other leading men of the place. Flags were fly ing half-mast at the principal public places and at Mr. Holgate's, where the body lay The church choir sang the the 286th Hymn A.&M.; and the Rev. Mr. Clairs preached a funeral sermon in the evening. Mr. Clairs started on the Monday for a visit to the Warren, preaching at various homesteads on his way out and returning by another route, so as to visit the settlers on the Lower Blackwood; reaching Bus selton on Saturday afternoon in time for (he meeting held in the Working Men's HalL Thus he lost no time. In accordance with a notice posted up a meeting was held in the Working Men's Hall at 3 p. m. for the purpose of forming a committee to collect money and produce for the relief of the sufferers by the late disastrous floods at the Greenough. The Mayor (Mr. G. H. Knapton) having read the requisition asking him to convene the meeting the Rev. Mr. Clairs proposed and Dr. Lepper seconded the motion, 'that the Mayor retain the chair.' It was also pro posed and carried that the Rev. Mr. Clairs and Fathier Tracey act as secretaries; also that the Resident Magistrate (Dr. Lepper) act as treasurer. Mr. Guerrier proposed and the meeting approved of the following persons acting on the committee to receive contributions :— Busselton : M. Lockhart, W. and J. BovelL G. Cross, A. R. Pries, G. Rose. Wonnerup : G. Layman and Locke Brothers. Blackwood and Warren: E. R. Brockman and T. Dixson. New Town: T. A. Thurkle and E. Dawson. Quinda lup: H. J. Yelverton and J. Harwood. Augusta Sawmills : M C. Davies. It was decided to receive cash or produce of any kind. Mr. John Bovell suggested that all produce received be sold in the district— a suggestion that appeared to be approved of by the meeting-. The Rev. Mr. Clairs then handed to the treasurer the following sums, collected by him upon his recent visit to the Warren and Lower Blackwood: R. Blythe, £1; W. Scott. £1; S. Longbottom, jr., 10s.; T. Longbottom, 10s. 6d.; T. Smith, 2s. 6d.; E. Brockman, £2; T. Dickson, £1; W. Longbottom, 10s.; C. Longbottom, 10s.; C. L. children £1; total, £7 4s. Several others in the room also contributed, viz., Dr. Lepper, £2 2s. ; Rev. Mr. Claire, 10s. 6d. ; Mrs. Claira, 5s. ; G. F. Guerrier, £1; G. H. Kna^ton, JE1 ; A. R. Pries. 10s. 6d.; W. R. P. Smith, 10s. ; Q. Rose, 10s. ; A, Cole, 5s. ;— making a grand total of £13 17s. Taking into consideration the fact that there were only eleven persons present the above speaks well for the commencement. It is a great prty that more persons did not show up, but I have no doubt that, when appealed to, many more wfll contribute freely. Those present were Dr. Lepper, R.M., Mr. G. Layman, M.L.C., Bev. Mr. Clairs, Messrs. Guerrier, G. H. Knapton, John Bovell, T. A. Thurkle, G. Rose, W. R. P. Smith, A. R. Pries, and A. Cole. After a vote of thanks to ihe Mayor for presiding and wish ing the committee success the meeting broke up. It may be worth while mgnfamitiig that the treasurer (Dr. Lepper) requeste that all monies be paid to him, at bis office. Mr. John Bovell has disposed of his cacer 'Paddy' to Mr. Sholl, at a fair price. Messrs. Locke have also disposed of their mare ' Grace Darling.' Except at the Hwmelin and Bocamnup j mills the timber trade is not vei'J brisk. ?Mr. Yelverton is only just keeping' bis works going; the ' BaUarat ' being dor mant at present. As a proof of the scarcity [ of work I saw a poor man, bis wife and a little boy tramping to the Augusta mills the other day in search of work, and the man assured me they bad walked all the way from Perth.
