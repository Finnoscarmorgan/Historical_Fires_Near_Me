SERIOUS BUSH-FIRES AT COLAC. Great bush-fires were burning all Tuesday in the forest in the neighborhood of the south and east of Colac. The whole country between Gerangamete and Murroon is full of fires. On Monday fires broke out at a paddock known as Moylan's, at Yeo, and burned a quantity of division fencing on the properties of Messrs Rands, Lawlor, and others. This fire was not extinguished until Tuesday morning, and just before it was got under a fire broke out in the paddock of Mr Kettle, near the township of Birregurra, and it is still burning. Fires are also still burning on the Loutit Bay track. A fire occurred at Mr Armytage's property on Monday, and did much damage on the property of Messrs Keating, Barr, and others. Another fire broke out on the Mount Pleasant estate, and burned 800 acres of grass on the adjoining estate of Mr J. F. Strachan, at Mount Gellibrand. The fires in the forest will not be hurtful unless they spread. Those on the grass lands have chiefly damaged fencing, as the grass was short. The rabbits have been found roasted in some places. So many fires have not been seen at one time in this district for several years. Several of them are undoubtedly caused by incendiaries. The weather has been very hot.â€”Argus telegram.
