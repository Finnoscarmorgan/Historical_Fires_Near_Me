I THE WEATHER. The heat to-day has been of that description I best spoken of as intense. What wind has H stirred the dust (and there has been very H little of it), has come from the north, and H swept before it the sultry fumes of the bushfires, which are reported as raging in that direction. The readings of the thermometers at the various places are nearly as high as those of any day this summer. At B Dennis Bros.s, at half-past one, 100,deg. in the shade was registered. At Mr Gaunt's, in the Arcade frontage (a very cool place), the thermometer showed 90 dog., but it ranged to 93deg. in Bourkc street ; while the reading in the sun was 127 dcg. At Joseph Brothers the maximum reading was 99 dcg. At tho Observatory the highest temperaturo in the shade was 102 dcg., rind in the sun 144 deg. The weather inland, as well as along the West coast, is hot, with a light, moderate Westerly breeze. There is, at present', no indication of a change, except at Eucln, where it is threatening rain, with a light S.W. rind.
