TASMANIA. THE BUSH FIRES. Hobart, Thursday. The Premier, accompanied by the Minister of Lands, went through the Ferntree pro- perty and the Longley and Sandfly districts on Tuesday, and witnessed the devastation caused by the recent bushfires. The Govern- ment has decided to give such assistance as will ensure relief to those in distress. In the meantime a supply of tents, blankets and cooking utensils has been sent to meet requirements, and an effort will be made to find work for the sufferers. Public subscrip- tions have been solicited, and the appeal is being fairly well responded to. " Tatter- sall" forwarded a donation of £100. Now that telegraph communication with the country districts is being restored, details are arriving, and the damage in all cases far exceeds expectations. The Minister of Lands has lost fences, grass and crop of the value of £300. The Tyler sawmills and outbuild- ings at Port Esperance, in the Huon district, were consumed, but were fully insured.
