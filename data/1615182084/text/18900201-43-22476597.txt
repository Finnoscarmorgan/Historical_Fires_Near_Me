Cobrico. Thursday. There is not much to report from here. We have so far fortunately escaped the [possibly bushfires??] that have been raging in [??] We are anxiously looking [??] soaking rain and some cooler weather than that experienced here The [??] of grasshoppers are very [??] about here just now, and are doing a considerable mischief in the gardens. They are eating the leaves and fruit on the trees. I suppose that the pests require something moist, hence their liking for apples and pears. I notice that we are prromised a new bridge over the Cobrico outlet, and it is hoped that the new structure will be something substantial. The state of the present bridge is dangerous. Foxes are getting very numerous. They are very frequently seen by persons sneaking about in the scrubby parts of the forest. I do not hear of any losses in the poultry line. It is hoped that reynard will confine his attentions to the rabbits. The extreme heat experienced lately has roasted some of the fruit on the trees. What with heat, strong winds, a light crop, and locusts, the [??] promises to is a bad one for the fruit grower. I notice that our council has made a start at improving our main Cobden and Cobrico road. The piece formed and gravelled near the corner of the property of the late Mr. D. S. Walker might, to my mind, be extended a few chains further eastward. I cannot understand the object of discontinuing the gravelled portion in a hollow, unless it be that we may be able to fully appreciate the benefit of the good road by the suddenness of the change from good to bad, and vice versa. As regards the weather, were I to quote in the style of a salesman, I should say that at present the supply of wind and heat esceeds the demand, and that the supply of rain is not nearly sufficient to meet present requirements.
