Those who work in opposition to the coni mtLndi of (lie Union arc mobbed and mal which almost Rnccceded, was laid to blow up a colliery -with gunpowder. The original .strike seems to have been quito unjustifiable, and the means Uy which it is sought to main tain it are, such as cannot bo tolerated in nuy cirilized country. The other day it was judged ueoessiu-y to send a Uordcufelt gnn and a detachment of the Permanent Artillery to East fcauibtou, where some labourers en gaged in filling small coal, were stoned. Al though iu this instance, the necessity for ac tion bad disappeared before the mili tary reached tho scene, it appears only too probwHo that serious bloodshed will take place before the disturbance is ended. The irrepressible member for Northumberland, Mr. Niman Melville, is on the spot, but as liis chief desiro seems to be to 'make him self solid ' with the strikers, his presence, to put it mildly, is of no great assistance in the conservation of law and order. The procla mation idsuod by the Government, -which notinos that all peaceable citizens will re ceive the protection of the authorities in pursuing their kn- ful avocations, he held up to public opprobrium, the other night before a throng of excited miners. Such a coarse can have no other result than that of inten sifying the bitterness and increasing tie mis-' understanding which already prevail. \^. Regarding the economic aspect' of the .question some important changes«have taken place. The coal-owners, we may explain »re not united. There are the - associated col lieries, by far the most powerful fcody, who .control the market, and have a, mutoftl agree ment, called the ' vend ' to restrict the out put within certain limits and thereby main tain prices. Then there are 4he);#on--*- sociated collieries, who have not joined &e; ' vend, ' but who work for ' tbeiro.wnjiinfl.*^ The latter lad nothing to do wfla'j^^^ip putes, which led to the strike, y of^l&eir; fits were laid idle with the othei^ty%||||| the Union.'.

A NERRIGUNDAH correspondent says : — A very rich reef has been discovered about a quarter of a mile east of the Mount Coman Goldmining Company's property. Very little bas been done ja the way of exposing the reef two small trenches have been put down to a depth of about 15 inches, the reef showing in both trenches a width of about 18 inches to 2 feet, with good gold showing freely in tho stone. I have seen specimens taken from each trench and they are much superior to anything yet unearthed in this district. The prospectors are Messrs. J. W. Redgrave and W. Thompson, who have taken up a 4-acre lease. No. 1 south of the prospectors has been pegged out and applied for by Mr. E. J. Coman and Mr. Kennedy. Great excitement prevails in Nerrigundafa owing to the rich specimens shown, and a rush is expected. THe Committee of the A. and P. Society met on Tuesday afternoon, when the follow ing tiiemliers put in an appearance, Messrs. E. Anderson J.P., (chairman) B. H. Harvis3ii, V Jeffrey sen., \V. Mclntosh sen., J. Skehan, E.
