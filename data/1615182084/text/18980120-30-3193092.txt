BUSH FIRES IN VICTORIA. Melbourne, January 19. Telegrams from different parts of the colony show that bush fires are still in evidence and demand constant watching on the part of settlers. A telegram from Leongetha states that bush fires are again raging all round the township, and it was only by most continuons efforts main- tained the whole night that several settlers saved their property. News to hand from Maffra states that a fire started in one of the paddocks of the Powers Court Estate yesterday afternoon, and swept 1,500 acres. The homestead nar- rowly escaped destruction. Considerable anxiety was felt at Neerim south owing to several bush fires. A strong wind had fanned the smouldering embers into flames and sparks were flying in all directions, threatening danger to a number of buildings which escaped destruction last week. Happily the wind changed, and turned the flames away from the town back into the bush. The danger is by no means over yet, and the settlers are becoming ex- hausted by the strain of watching their properly day and night and beating out the flames started by sparks and other flying debris. Dangerous fires are raging at Gordon and Pakenham, and are doing great damage to fencing and grass.
