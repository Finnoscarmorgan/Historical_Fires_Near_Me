TOCUMWAL v. BERRIGAN. (FROM OUB OWN COBBEBPONDENT.) The cricket match between Tocumwal and Berrigan, which was postponed owing to the bushflres, cajne off on Saturday last, and I can assure you we have Borne very promising players in both teams, and who with reasonable practice will turn out a, good eombined team. Play commenced at 3 o'clock. Mr. J. S. Howard and Mr. T. Nash acted as umpires for Tocumwal and Berrigan respectively, and Mr. John Woodlock and Mr. Joseph Howard as scorers. Tocumwal won the fans and elected to defend the wicket The last wicket fell for 58, and the Berrigan boys then went in, but through the cuperior bowling of J. Crow and Alexander they were all disposed of for the small number of 21 runs. The Tocumwal team again went in, and were all disposed of for 52. Berrigan in their second innings commenced in right good style, and put 42 runs together in a veiy short space of time for the loss of four wickets, when the shades of evening eaused them to retire to Host Howard's where, after a sumptuous dinner, they all enjoyed themselves thoroughly. I do not like to particularise the players, but I will mention a few names of coming men, viz .- For Tocumwal, G. Turner, Alexander, D. Hillson, J. Crow, W. H. Crow, 8. Crow, Hamon, and not forgetting our worthy P.M. (Mr. P. Dunn), to whose exertions the game is kept alive; for the Berrigan boys, Chaffey, W.Nash, Pyle, Corbet Symmonds, and Burns. The Berrigan " boys " with practice will give a good account of them selves next season.
