GUILDFORD. From our own Correspondent. A special meeting of the Guildford Cricketers was held this (Tuesday) evening, at the Liverpool Arms, to consider whether it be advisable to play the College Club. Some new bats and balls have been provided; the money and perseverance are about the greatest need. There is some idea about getting our ground covered with sand and sown with couch- grass, which, if attainable, will be a great improvement. The new church at the Middle Swan will be comme- erated on Wednesday (this day), it is a very pretty building, and reflects great credit to the ladies, their pastor, and many others, who have taken so-much interest in it. The poor old man who was drowned last week was buried at dusk without any service, I am given to understand, on account of his intemperate habits. There is a rumour that while one of his friends was examining his papers, he observed an old will bequeathing a sum to the Roman Catholic Chapel. This, I think, is doubtful, as be was considered a poor man. Mr. Meadowcroft gave his second series of Sunday- afternoon readings in the school-house, which was well attended. The bush-fires still continue destroying feed and doing other damage, small and great. A man in the employ of Mr. Robins, of Beverley, was thrown from his hone on Friday, and received several serious bruises. There has been a large quantity of fruit seat up from Perth and distributed among poor people, .and those not owning a garden. Services are held in St. Matthew's Church every Friday evening. Tenders are solicited for carting 40,000 bricks from Mr. Reily's store to the Glebe, to be used in building out Parsonage. This is a building greatly required, and will be a great saying to the Govern- ment. The amount they have offered to the the building committee is far short of what was expected.
