JUNEE JUNCTION. MONDAY, November 28. (FBOM OUB OWN COBBESPONDENT.) That the conduct of the electors of Junee towards one of their members, Mr. Gale, was disgraceful, all.muBt admit. Mr. Gale certainly has not visited the Murrumbidgee electorate since he took his seat in the House, but he might have been allowed to vindicate the course he has taken. And what is still more in his favour, he came to speak on Free Trade and Protection, and as, it will be remembered, it was on this issue he gained his seat at the hist e'ection, he was fairly entitled to an impartial hearing at the hands of his constituents. Haymaking hias commenced in this district, aud considering tbe grand season we have just experienced, there should be an abundant yield per acre. . The weather remains extremely hot; still we are likely to hare a heavy fall of rain by the appearance of the upper surroundings. A good steady fall would have a very beneficial effect on all vegetation at the present juncture. It would dispel the thought of bush- fires from our minds, and it would be the means of considerably allaying the grass seeds. The question of re-naming the colony appears to be engaging the attention of our pfeBS'and politicians, bnt of the long list of names proposed â€¢ none is, I am of opinion, so suggestive of fact as "Gone Bung." In every sense of:the word it is appropriate, being up to the spirit of the age. It is no use trying to.plac6 a' [silvern mantle over die small remaining I fundB of our exchequer. If the Goveramentrio not adopt my favorite name," Gone Bung," it is to be sincerely hoped they will call the colony " Australia," as that was the name it was first designated.
