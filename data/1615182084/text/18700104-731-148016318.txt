The most notice able feature on the side of the Natives was the excellent bowling ofSyoung Powers (a novice); who'will in time jbg .one' &f; the best bowlers in the colony.

The fifthl ball of Powers'snext was a sneezer, and put Bryant horg de combat, after earning three. 5 wickets for 48. ' J. L.

The teams now adjourned . to Bonarius', .where; an excellent luncheon had . been provided,- which was done full justice to by the players, whp.^howed tha the exercise had not taken away, their appe tites.

' We are glad to see that the Queens- ( j lajider is very earnest in this direction, and- is j doing excellent service. Under this head we i may. refer tp_tlie letter 'of ' Defactui.' The I writer will perhaps accept our thanks for ''his - information. What we published of Mr. !

With'respect to the ! cTaims of large' mills' versu^ small mills, what ; we said is based upon experience in New South ! Wales'and the West Ljdiea, Our bias is dis tinctly- in favor jif small mills, ior the conVe- ' nience of districts which,. although fitted for sugar culture, are not likely to tempt capi talists; but whatever maybe the success. of - the small crushers as to 'the quality; of the ! sjigar producedj-we fear that they. will, find : themselves' undersold by the large maker, whose expenses are all -reduced. The argu ment employed .in discussing the/question of ; '£ti. large .and small farms applies .in' this. case. Again'j let u-s say that experience^proves us' to be very ..deficient in competent managers of sugar mills. There is a great deal of preten sion to extraordinary ability, but many of those now employed have gained, or are gain- : ing, their experience at the expense of their ! employers. We are glad to find that this»js ! not the case at Maryborough, to which district I our remarks had no reference. ' --
