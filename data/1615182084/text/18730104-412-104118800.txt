They would further respectfully suggest that authority be. given to the Post master at Albury to Hetaiu the Wagga coach until the duo time of the Melbourne mail, and a like power conferred on the Wagga Postmaster to despatch the return coach so as to meet the Melbourne mail from Alhnry at the time of its fixed departuro. (6) Your memorialists would also point out that a large amount of correspondence relating to tbo important stock trade of Riverina is , conducted between Wagsa. and Victoria; 1 that under present disabilities the transac tions of pastoral tenants and stock-owners generally are seriously hampered, and ini some instances entirely defeated, because of: the imperfect postal system between the two colonies. They therefore respectfully suggest that they have a title to claim relief at thf hands of the Government in this respect; and now beg that you will bo pleased to make arrangements for the conveyance of a daily mail to and from Albury and Wag^'a direct. This alteration could, in their opinion, be effected at a reasonable cost in addition to the present contract charges, as they have reason to believe that the mail contractors, whose subsidy is remarkably . small, would willingly ' fall in with the "rrrangement on being paid an addition to tSw^preaent remuneration, based upun the exisBg agreement, and prn ruin, far the ex fcrai9.il8 to be carried.
