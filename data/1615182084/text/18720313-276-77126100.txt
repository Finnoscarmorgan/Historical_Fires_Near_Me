SHEEP CASE.-The case relative to certain s'lieep which belonged to Mr. John Livingstone, a^nd which has been pending for more than six months, was decided in Melbourne on Friday lasr, The Argus of Saturday thus refers to it: -"?In the Supreme Court yesterday an-action", was tried in which the London imd> Australian Agen.*5y Company were sued by Messrs. Mathews, butcheTS, of Geelong, for dama^ for. not deliv ering 6,000 sheep purchased in February! .1871, but not^delivered. The company appeared to be mortgagees of d station in South Australia, and it was their agent that made the bargain with plaiiriiffs. The owner of the run refused to allow the sheep to be removed, as he consid ered thafc tlie price was too little, and ..then the plaintiffs; claimed damages from defendants, as they had'gbnc to considerable; expense in conse quence of the contract; Defendants-then denied that it was on their behalf the sale was made, and said that they only consented, to the sale as. mortgagees. The jury gave tv verdict for plain- * tiffs for £275." O . The*FOLEY TROUPE.-On Monday evening this talented troupe made their first -ippearanfce before a Mount Gambiei- audience/ and were well received. Owing probably to n counter attraction in the shape of a temperance lecture in the 0..and F. Hall, the attendance was not so large as it might otherwise liaVe been. The entertainment "was of a miscellaneous. character, embracing dramatic acts, singing (comic and sentimental), dancing, and gyro nasties.
