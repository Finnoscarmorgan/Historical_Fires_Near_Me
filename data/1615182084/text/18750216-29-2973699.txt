GERALDTON, (Friday, I2th Feb, 1875.) On Wednesday, the Steamer arrived after a quick run of 26 hours from Fremantle, bring- ing about forty passengers, and English and Colonial mails. It is with some suprise that week after week we see some imaginary grievance or unkind expression given to the world by a V*sse correspondent to one of your contemporary* Â¿ against the captain, more parti culary than uhe Steamer. The experience at this end, where Capt. MeKennon is quite as will known as at the Vasse is that he is a most obliging captain and skilful navigator, and when his command should terminate it will be a matter of extreme regret to every one that ever goes as passenger in the steamer, and are more competent to judge than any one that merely writes what he wishes, [We gladly endorse the opinion expressed by our correspondent. Ed. W.A.T] Bushfires have been very prevalent, and fencing has been destroyed to a considerable amount. Wheat is now coming into the Bay in considerable quantities, but up to date no pri3e has been fixed.
