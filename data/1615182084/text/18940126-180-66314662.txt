80VTB AUSTRALIA. Adelaide, January 24. An improved business in West Australian gold stocks is taking place, but prices all round are lower. Silver stocks arÂ» firmer. Yesterday a deputation waited upon the Premier for the purpose of bring ing under his consideration some documents relating to the original constitution of the South Australian Land Company prior to the founda* tien of the colony, which show that the intention of the founders of the Company was purely philanthropic and not with a view to the making of profit byi foe sale of land, and that all the Company's tenants were to have the right of purchasing the land oc cupied by them. The matter is ex . citing considerable interest, and it is the intention of the deputatiouists to- establish a legal flaw in the current leases. The weather continues to be tre mendously hot, the , thermometer ranging about 107 degrees in the shade and 170 in the sun. A number of large bush-fires around the city are adding to the oppressiveness of the atmosphere.
