Jenolan Caves. Our Rydal correspondent writes : Mr. Thomas Burnet, from the Architect's Department, paid a visit to the Jenolan Caves and inspected, and expressed himself highly pleased with the progress of the works in connection with the erection of the caves' build- ings. The excavation, under the direction of Mr. Dunbar, is nearing completion and is in itself a very creditable piece of work, cutting into the hill through diorite and basalt to a depth of 30ft, while at the quarries a large amount of stone is ready dressed for the erection of the accommodation house. Altogether twenty-one men are employed, and are making good headway consider- ing the material they are working. While the quarry men were at work they uncovered a remarkable looking- hole, which appears to be of considerable depth. It is lined with a crystalised lime formation, evidently another cave. Mr. Wilson, the caves explorer, descended on Saturday with a view of exploring. Twenty odd passengers passed through Hampton by Mr. Cooper's line of coaches on Saturday. Bush- fires are raging in the vicinity of Hampton. The weather is exceedingly dry, rain being badly needed for the potato and corn crops.
