C?OOKWELL. Busn-mesns.--We have been surrounded here by bush-fires of lato. On Thursday last perhbps the most serious one this year occurred, commencing upon Mr. L. Purcell's laud. Considerable diffliulty was experienced in combating the fire, in which ample assistance was roudered by the neighbours. Mr. I'urcell has lost all his feed, upon which he was about to depasturo sheep, and was actually about purchasing sheep for the purpose when the fire cropped him out. Yesterday we had fires still more immediately in our neighbourhood, commencing at or abont the back of Mr. Keith's. The fire ranged along to close upon Mr. HIoward's. A number of volunteers had to knock off threshing for the day in order to wrestle with the fiery king, in which they were eventually successful. Voluntary or involun tary inceudiarists cannot be too much inveighed against, and it should be iuumnbeut upon everyone to use their utmost endeavours to guard against such a common enemy. Conceort.-The Church of England concert that was to have been hold on Friday next ihas been post poned to the following day, namely, Saturday 4th instant. There will be on the occasion considerable valuablo assistance, which has not been heard yet in Croolkwell, and which will prove to be of an order of merit that we but rarely meet with. I must I suppose wind up with the weather, which is still of the some harassing dry nature. There was a - semblance of a shower on Monday evening, nothing more.
