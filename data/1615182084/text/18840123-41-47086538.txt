Some excitement has been manifested at Lismore consequent on the report that iho Government intend to impose a duty on colonial-made sugar, and meetings have bsen called to protest against the threatened action, as it is considered that at this early stage in the sugar-growing industry,' wnere so much outlay is required, a duty would be ruinous. On Monday the steamtug Comat, with anchors aboard, proceeded to the stranded steamer lismore, and endeavoured to get a line ashore, but failed in the attempt, owing to the heavy sea. To-day the attempt was renewed, and resource was h%d to the Government rocket apparatus from the pilot station, which answered admirably, two shots carrying the line over the Lismore. Unfortunately, however, the warp at tached to the cable parted when nearly aboard the tug ; but two additional cables are now being carted [round, and another attempt will be made to lay the anchor out. The Lismore appears still to be watertight, and , the cargo is believed to be uninjured, and discharging will probably be commenced to-morrow.
