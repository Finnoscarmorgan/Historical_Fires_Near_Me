PENOLA, Match 2. ! We have had very warm weather in Penola for the last few weeks. Hot winds have been plentiful, and bush-fires of daily occurrence. So far we have cause for thankfulness in that no serious damage has been done by the fires. The forthcoming general elections are causing no stir here as yet. No meetings have been called, and no candidate has addresesd us, so that up to the present we are in blissful ignorance as to the intentions of our future representatives. — Yesterday was the anniversary of the St. Mary's Church of England Sunday school. The children were treated to a day's outing, and were liberally supplied with cakes, lollies, and fruit, and indulged in various sports. The weather was very hot, hut the youngsters appeared to enjoy themselves thoroughly. — The Penola Sawmills have been idle for a long time past. The proprietors, MeBsrs. J. & J. Biddoch, cave decided to start the machinery once more. I believe operations will be in full swing in about a week's time.— Mr. Marcus's daughter, whose adventures with a bull I wired to you last week, is progressing favorably. Dr. Stock attends her, and pro nounces her out of danger. ;
