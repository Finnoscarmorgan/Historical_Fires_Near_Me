? __^^. _ .?*. ? „ ? It is satisFaotory to find that tbe reply oE the Amalgamated Shearers' Union to tbe 'bush-fira' manifesto of the Pastoralists' Union i3 a studi ously cool and c al m document politely inviting that body to ''appoint representatives to confer with representatives of the A. S. U. with a viow of effecting au amicable uaderalaudiug rcgordiug the cuuiing season's shearing ousraticujs.11 C'I£ they may be permitted to express an opinion/' writes the, ifc must bo admitted, not always so ciourfceouo secretary, *' my council consider it the duty of both sides to exhaust every peaceable means at their disposal to effect an adjustment of existing faculties b afore resolving upon the serious and momentous step oE plunging the eou.utey into the throes of: another industrial ?TK)!',' and he adds what is a re;illy-remarkable ad mission on his p2.it fcr the benefit; of the other side, that ' strikes and &11 such means to an end only engender bad feeling and incur loss to both sides.' Most true, though rather for his side a late discovery, and seeing that the pastorali&fov;, flushed with success in the late struggle, s^am to have determined that in future there shall be only one side, not likely, -we fear, to have much practical effect. The request of the shearers' council, how ever, for the conference is couched in almost humble terms, gs little like those of the ' my council ' of the able secretary on the other sid^ as good whiskey is to bad, and is so manifestly fair and just that it is to he hoped it will be acceded to without difficulty, and—though this, we fear, is more doubtful still— -nave all the so properly desired result*.
