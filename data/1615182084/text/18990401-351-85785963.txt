East Hills. Great regret is felt at the sudden death of Mrs. Anderson, the wife of Mr. C. T. Anderson, vice-president of the Progress Association. The funeral was very largely attended. The weather has been even hotter than before, during the last few days. Bush- fires are raging in all directions, and the atmosphere is thick with smoke. Large fires have been burning in Padston Park, and along the river frontage of East Hills during the past week, while the strong north-west wind brought great heat and dense clouds of smoke from fires burning in the direction of Liverpool. Drinking water is getting scarcer every day and it has been necessary to cart fresh supplies to the public school, South Bankstown. Are hoping for a continuance of rain which commenced to fall on Satur- day.
