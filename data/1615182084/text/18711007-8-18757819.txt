MAITLAND AND ITS NEIGHBOUR- HOOD. {From Vu S. M Herald, Ort 3 ) I. The first idea that naturally suggests itself in con- nection with the word " Maitland" is " floods;" but I am happy to say that these hare no connection at the present moment, On the contrary, Maitland in common with many other parta of the colony has been threatened with a somewhat smaller evil in the shape of drought But the prospect of even that has now been temporarily removed, and agricultural concerns are as promising as could well be expected Thirteen j cara of floods I A district that can stand a trial so severe without being irretrievably ruined must h&\e in it the elements of prosperity and wealth No one who now for the first time looks open the fertile fields-some green with springing luceme, and others undergoing the various proces- ses of cultivation-could imagine the scene of deso- lation and barrenness almost constantly presented by those same fields foi; the last thirteen years Lands that have been under water for months together axe now dry and covered with crops, or knots of men driving the long disused plough or harrow K joyfu» change I At present the prospects of a rich harvest are good Although rain was much wanted a few da}s since, the little that fell on Friday and Saturday jost is ample for the present requirements of those whose land is well tilled and deeplj ploughed. Fear of rust has, to a great extent, deterred farmers from sowing wheat, and I am informed that there is very little of it in the district, tho principal crops being lucerne, maize, potatoes, and tobacco, this last, how e\er,is confined chiefly to the lands on the Paterson, Williams, and Allyn Rivers. The absence of floods this year has so raised the hopes of the farmers that a larger area of country has been ploughed during the last few months than in any former season, nearlj the whole of the agricul- tural surface of the district being now under culti- vation A good deal of the-land so tilled is intended for the production of theunphee or Planters'Friend, a fact which is due to the success attendant upon the recent attempts of Mr Newton to obtain a good marketable sugar from that variety of cane What the result of tins comparatively new enterprise will he is rather uncertain, as Mr newton, ¿unng his numerous experiments, did not ascertain the actual yield of sugar per acre, and until that ia known, it ia impossible to foresee whether or not the cultiva tion of impnee will pay As for as gardens are con- cerned, the aphis has been very destructive, and gardeners are hoping for thunderstorms to destroy the aphides. The effects of the late drought are most apparent in the dry and withered appearance of the grags, but in many places this has been re- moved tjy bush-fires, and will be speedily replaced by a new and greener growth Waterholes and creeks are still well-supplied from the rams that fell in the early part of the year, and, on the whole, the agricultural prospects of the district are brighter than they have been for many a dar Orchards ai*e look- ing well, and there is e\ery promise of an abundant supply of fruit. Concerning the town of West Maitland, there 13 much to be said The first things that strike the visitor are its supreme dnlness, the neglected state of the streets, and the half-ruined and seedy ap- pearance of many, very many of the buildings The ruins of the river embankment still lie unmolested half across High-street, as they have done for months past, but strange to say, notwithstanding the ex- treme narrowness of the portion of the carnage-way which they do not obstruct, thej have not yet been the cause of a smgle accident The Borough Coun- cil in their fierce contentions about the floodgates for Wallis* Creek, seem to have forgotten the streets entirely The foot and carnage wa\ a are m many places in a shameful state of disrepair, and filth of all landa is suffered to lie on them without any at- tempt at its removal, or the punishment of those who cast it there But, speaking of floodgates, it may be as well to notice that some time since two large agricultural areas were annexed to the municipality of West Maitland on the understanding that flood- gates should be erected near the outlet of Wallis' Creek which flows between East and West Maitland Accordingly, money was borrowed and floodgates were erected, nut the ¿rat flood that came washed them awaj, and nothing now remains to remind one of the memorable day when their foundation stone was laid with due pomp and ceremony dv the Hon John Robertson, but a few miserable heaps of stones, where the the gates are, goodness only knows-1 searched for thom, but my labour was lost The rates collected from the annexed areas do not qmto Biifflce to pay the interest on the money that has been already borrowed, and jet the Council aro making application to the Government for leave to raise a further sum of ¿'3000 on debentures for the purpose of erecting new floodgates The interest taken in this matter, however, seems to be confined almost entirely to members of the Council, while the majority of the townspeople appear to regard the scheme as a huge joke, and they sneer at it accord- ingly But m neglecting the immédiate and press- ing interests of the town, the Council apparently is onl> following the example of the Government West Maitland, with the exception perhaps of Bathurst, is the largest country town in the colony, and yet it has been for the last eighteen months without either courtr-house or lock-up The results of this state of affairs are very incon- venient. The Courts of Petty Sessions are held twice a week m the Municipal Council Chamber, a email dl-ventilated room, which is totally unfit for the purpose In consequence of this most of the unpaid magistrates refuse to attend, and the police magistrate is generally left alone in his glory to conduct the business of the Court-a state oí affairs which is certainly undesirable Again, the absence of a lock-up necessitates the convej ance of all West Maitland delinquents to the East Maitland lock-up, a distance of between two and three miles, and bo for every drunkard or other offender who falls into the clutches of the police, the former town is de finved of the protection of two constables for at east an hour, and oftener for a much longer period And while this is the «tato of affairs m the West, a new lock up has just been completed at East Maitland, because the old one, although perfectly serviceable, was considered to be situated at an inconvenient dis- tance from the Court-houso-that distance being about nalf-a mile The Government, however, has not altogether neglected the interests of either West or East Mait- land, for within the last few j ears two iron bridges have been erected over the Hunter River-the one at West Maitland and the other at Pitnacree-on the road between the town of Largs and East Mait land. Up to the 22nd instant ooth these bridges were free, but since that data a toll has been estab- lished at each of them Of course no one con com- plain of this, and no one, as far as I can learn, does complain of the mero fact But this passenger toll, just and equitable enough though it may be, presses very hardly on the parents of poor country chil- dren who attend the pubhc and other schools m Maitland There is no school for many miles on the other side of the river, and the children must attend Maitland schools or none at all, and therefore the impost is in their case peculiarly unjust The toll- houses which hare been erected by the Government at these bridges are so very remarkable that I must be pardoned if I devote a line or two to a de- scription of them The material used in their con- struction is bark-good old stringybark. Then height is about 6¿ feet, length 10 feet, and breadth 7 feet. There is a chimney to each of them, but that at Belmore Bridge is the more costly, being built of slabs, whilst that at Pitnacree is composed of the same material as the main edifice Neither of them has a window or aperture of any kind for the admission of light, except sundry cracks m the roof, which admit nun also Tuero is no flooring beyond the primeval sand, and there is not a single article of furniture in either of them. Of course, catches or fastenings of any kind to the doors ore unneces- sary, and therefore not provided The toll house at Belmore Bridge beare a very creditably-executed msenpuon-" Ebected by the Govebvmeyt of New South Walks .* But there are some really pleasing and creditable institutions in Maitland, and foremost among them is the Hospital, a notice of which I must reserve for a future paper (and which will be found in our sup plement). Dutt o\ Stock Imfoetkb ixto Tictobia -In support of tile agitation for an import duty on live stock, the Hamilton Spectator says -"Free-fraders can consistently support the movement, for, if we cannot have free trade pure and simple, the nearest approach to it is to inaugurate protection all round The western district in \ letona is the portion of the colony where the hardship of the existing arrange- ment is most severely felt, and therefore it devolves particularly upon the settlers here to express their opinions. From the absence of railways, we are shut out from our own stock markets, and we are deluged by a heavy influx from South Australia of sheep raised on cheap grass, whilst the neighbouring colony refuses to reciprocate by admitting stock from Victoria. The people alonsrthe Hurray suffer in like manner from hew South Wales, hut they, at least, have the same railway facilities for getting their stock to market as our Legislature has con- ferred on the graziers of Riverina. We hope to see the subject ventilated, as suggested, at a public J metung." '
