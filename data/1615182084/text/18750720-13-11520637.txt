THE BUSH FIRES RELIEF FUND. TO THE EDITORS OF THE ARGUS. Sir, -On referring to The Argus of the 17th, I find a letter, signed "Callman," also a few remarks by you in which you state that as far as you are aware there is no committee in existence for tho relief of sufferers by the late bush fires. I would suggest that before this money that has been collected for the above is applied to anything, that if the proprieto of the St. Arnaud Mercury is applied to some information will be got. A com mittee was organised at Wedderburn for the relief of the sufferers by the late bush fires I remain, &c.;, MOUNT KORONG.
