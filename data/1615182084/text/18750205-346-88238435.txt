THE BUSII-FIRE CALAMITY. (To the Editor of the Bcndigo Advertiser.} Sir,—For days past your pages have supplied harrowing descriptions o£ the calamitous state of things caused by the late autl present lire* iti the bush. And the conclusion is a reasonable one, that wlieu fuller particulars can be gathered from different and distant parts of the colony it will be fouud that the sum of human misery had been lold but in very small part. But surely enough is known already of the work of death and desolation to move every thinking mind and fecliug heart to the inquiry, Cau nothing be done by tiie prosperous and wealthy throughout (lie length and hn-adth of the colony, through the agency of spontaneous and liberal contributions, l-i express pers.iii:il gratitude for deliverance from sharing lis these e:Ll;v!iiiLios by the way of monetary sympathy with'the great numbers who have suddenly bean leduced from n position of comparative ;>Jliiierjce and competence to owe of complete destitution ami perfect ruin, exciting to crushing despair? Sir, as it lias not been done already by others, be volirs the privileged honor, by your editorial pen, of at once striking the key-note of appeal to human sympathy on behalf of those many now- ready to perish, which appeal, faith says, shall be promptly taken up and expanded unto a res ponse by other journalists, until the whole press of the eolony, speaking as with the voice of one man, shall ensure so noble a collection as to render needless (he application of those divinely inspired soul-stirring words, " Who so hath this world's (joods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, iiow dwelieth the love of (Jodinhim?" Soliciting the favor of the insertion of this feeble echo of the united voice of lamentation and woe, which now loudly and pleadingly erieth from all parts of the colony for pity and help. Lain, sir, vour»,miicli obliged, OiliUSTANIZKD UU.UANITY. ! 22nd January, 1875.
