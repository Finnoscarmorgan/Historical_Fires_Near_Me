UPPER ADELONG. (from our correspondent.) January 8th. â€” Bush-fires are now raging in almost every direction and have done consi- derable damage. Mr. A. Watson o,f this place, and Mr. J. Callaway, of Reedy Flat, have had a great portion of their fencing destroyed, and the grass for miles around has been consumed. It is presumed that fires have been wantonly lighted in various directions to prevent owners of sheep from bringing them hither. Assuming this to be the case, the incendiaries will themselves be great sufferers, as the only food for cattle, &c.;, is now com- pletely destroyed, and must necessarily occasion an advance in the price of butcher's meat, which, under existing circumstances, will be a tax difficult to be borne by those who are now suffering from scarcity of water to work their claims. It is to be hoped that accident and carelessness have been the cause. I have noticed that many men after lighting their pipes have a habit of throwing away the match regardless of the consequences. On Sunday last, a young man, a resident of Gilmore Creek, having imbibed rather too freely during the Christmas holidays, was observed to be suffering from ' delirium tremens' ; but as no one imagined that he contemplated any injury to himself, he was not sufficiently watched. Being missed on the following day, a search was made for him which terminated unsuccessfully. On Tuesday a number resumed the search, and the missing man was discovered near the Nackie Nackie Creek, divested of hat and boots. He had no idea of his position, and with difficulty recognised his friends. He was taken to Adelong where every attention was paid to him and be is expected to recover shortly from the effects of his over-indulgence. Work can scarcely, be said to be resumed in any of the claims since the holidays, lack of water being the impediment. The weather continues intensely hot.
