THE GOLD-FIELDS. TO THE KDITOR. Sirâ€” Will you permit; me through your valu able paper to speak a word in favour of the search for gold, as I see that 'One well acnuainted with Gold- fields' savs, with retrard to a royalty, tnat it wouia dc next to an impos sibility for tho Government to ascertain the quantity of gold obtained, and that the repu tation of the gold- fields would suffer to a 'great extent. Now, Sir, why not adopt the same plan as Victoria, and collect the duty or tax from tho gold brokers and bankers, as it would most decidedly be the best to levy a tax or duty' on gold rather than demand 10s., which maybe the only money a poor man has, and yet he may like to try his luck. There need bo no difficulty in the way, and we should then see our gold-bearing country fetter tested ; whereas now. a man dare not sink a hole without a licence, and lie may have a few days that he would like tp' .spend that way. The writer referred to also said' that the revenue would be too small. It might; be small for a time until our gold-fields are opened up { but we cannot expect to get them opened up under the present system of charging 10s., to be paid in advance. ? . . ' ' ' : 1 may say that gold exists in the ranges between the Jupiter and Meadows, I having obtained 1| ozs., of, beautiful waterrworn gold, one nugget weighing half an ounce. I may say, to help the small revenue, the best plan would be to put a ten-shilling tax on every man who carries a gun in' the bush, for that wants cheeking, as so many are endangering people's lives and breaking the Sabbath, to say nothing of starting bush-fires. I am, Sir, kc.. GEORGE PREWETT. Glengrove, Dashwood's Gully, January 29, 1870.
