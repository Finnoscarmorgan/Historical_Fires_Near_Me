BRAIDWOOD TO NELLIGEN. [FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.] IT is incredible how little the public in New South Wales know of the space of ground between Braidwood and Nelligen. When bus- ness calls me to Sydney, I often hear the questions, What part of your district is Nelligen ? Are your diggings on the Clyde River? What is it they call the Sugar Loaf? My excuse for writing these following lines is that I wish for searchers after nature's riches to come here, where they abound; but I sincerely wish a more able writer took the task off my hands, as the subject on which I am going to write is so grand, so sublime, and so well worthy of being publicly known, that I do not feel competent of doing it full justice. When in 1852 the gold-dljglngs broke out in this district husi- ' ness was tiansacteu with S)dneybv storekeiptrs, squatters, and even farmers, b) the ovtrlaud route Tia Bungonia, Marulan, and the main southern rond Loaded teams used to tate the bert part of a fortnight, when no accident happened to thrui, to pciform the joui ney one way, and, us business increased with the divelop meiuof our mines, the price oí cal nage rise greatly und was once as huh as £25 pel tou The greatest purt <>f eui i arlv min- ing population, mostl) at that time very poor-m fact, too poor to come overland to the lnnd ni promise- took, passug« in the few sailing vessels ttaduig to Moruva, and thence humped their swags tu liuluen, a dlstanie of 35 mile--a jomne) of three da)s Those «ho could alford it hired pack-hoises at Mullcndeiec, at a cost oí i'la, per 100 lbs , and, after two dais, i cached the- end of their joutney. Thu, state of things, w ith a quickly mci easing emigia tion, could not stand fur ever, anel business people bestirred them selies to have a quicker comiiumicution with the metiopohs. At that time sir Thomas Mitchell «as the Suivcvor-ticmral, und to him was entrusted the task ot Unding a 6bortei mute than to Moiuyu, between Braidwood and the sea-boaiil Bega was once thought ot, and a road wa« lound alter maní fatiguing se.uches. 'Ibis is the piiM-uae over the " lugar- lout," to teach the navigable water« ot the Clyde Hirer, at the spot chosen loi ii towns!))» it what is now the village of Nelligen The I S N Co. pionnsedto i un their boats to the tu minus of the loud, if a passable one WUK mude between Braidwood ana tho Clyde, and tin y hine faithfully lultiUi-d thin pi omise, ja over smce i*54 not a wuk hus passed h) without one oi two of their boats having brought marl) all the inifchuiid.se that sydney bus sent to this distuct, und m lut urn have taken much oí what we huvc exported. I he Sugar-loaf mountain is one of those beacons that the man- net at sea who knows this eou't looks loi as soon us heneuis land. It has been a ban lil between this distnet and the- sea coast, as hard to penetrate as the Blue fountains huve been betwem svdnei und the lcrtilc plains of Bathurst No «light oifnculties had bil Tilomas Mitchell to encounter in finding the ¿lg-.ug that now nuuks the roud between Braidwood and .Nelligen.
