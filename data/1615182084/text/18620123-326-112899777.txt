JOHN EVANS. - It is with feelings of regret that we record the death of Mr John Evans, of White- field, near Wangaratta, which event took place on Monday last, at his station. The deceased gentleman was one of the oldest residents in the district, and has always been highly respected by those who knew him. He was a man of an energetic and enterprising spirit; and in connection with Mr Evans, some few years since, he erected one of the most powerful steam flour mills in the neighbourhood. Mr Clarke has always predioposed to liberality towards his laborers, and his loss will be much felt in the m-igbboii ho<»ii o! his station by a great, '-purnbtr. who benefitted by h1" ;.tlvise "and assistance.

FOOLISH MINERS. —We have had of another instance of miners who have gone to New Zealand having left first rate claims. A party of men who were working a claim on the [[?Wimiso]] Reef Kangaroo Gully, beyond Amherst, left it to try their fortune in New Zealand. Another party took it up, and had their first crushing tried at Mr. Bartlemore's machine, Talbot, on Saturday last, where they obtained thirty-one and a half oz of gold from 9 tones of stone.

The MANGOPLAS MURDER - A communication has been receive by the police giving certain information respecting the man Step, whose body was supposed to be that of the mur- dered man found near Mangoplas. Sen constable Lynch, of the Wool- shed, had obtained from Amsteed Step, a colored man residing on the Ovens' the following description of the man alluded to :- Age, 41; height, 5 feet 6 inches; black hair, mixed with grey; stout built; no beard or whiskers when last seen by deponent, about twelve months ago; in 1859 was living on the Goulburn. This will satisfactorily set at rest the identity of the body with that of Step, as there does not seem to be the slightest resemblance between the two. It is most probably that of the tailor Mindelson, described by the witnesses at Albury, and an additional fact calculated very strongly to implicate the men Burke and Callen. \- Wagga Wagga Express
