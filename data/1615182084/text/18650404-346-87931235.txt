Mr John Mathieson, who has been for some time the general manager of "the Comet Company, Redan Hill, yesterdiy tendered his resignation. It is said that the cause of Mr Mathieson's re signation is that, the board of management having removed to Melbourne Mr Mathieson has found it impossible to carry on the efficient working of the mines consistently with instructions given by a board of directors, who, being at-a- distance, are necessarily ignorant of the business connected ; therewith. The resignation of Mr Mathieson, to whose able management is justly due the resuscitation of the company, has' caused con siderable dissatisfaction to many of the Sandhurst shareholders. FIRE IN PALL MALL.-A fire broke out last night, at about seven o'clock, in a small detached room at the back of the premises of Mr Charles Warder, of Pall Mall. The room was built of wood, and used as a sleeping place for the children. It appears that at a few minutes before the fire was noticed, Mrs Warder had put her little boy of hardly two years of age to bed, leaving a candle burning in the room. The servant was the first to give the alarm, and rushing fofward found the bed on fire, and the child enveloped in flimes. At once snatching the child from the bed, burning herself slightly in doing so. she saved it from immediate death, not however before it had sustained serious injuries. Dr Boyd was called in without delay, and pro nounced the injuries to be of a severe character. From the bed the fire quickly communicated to the furniture and walls of the apartment, and bursting through the roof gave an alarm to the neighborhood. A plentiful supply of water was obtained, and the flames subdued ; when, there fore, the engines arrived, they were not wanted. Mad the fire broken out at night, the results would probably have been most extensive and disastrous.
