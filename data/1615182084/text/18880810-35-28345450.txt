A SHIPWRECKED CREW SUPPOSED TO BE ON HOGAN ISLAND. (BY TELEGRAPH.) (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) MELBOURNE, THURSDAY. The Government steamer Lady Loch proceeded early this morning to Hogan Island, east of Wilson's Promontory, in view of the possibility of a shipwrecked crew being there, as it was reported late last night that a fire was seen burning there. The manager of the lighthouse station reports that he saw what he believed to be a number of men walking along the summit of the island, but since noon he saw nothing of them, nor of any signals.
