WOODHOUSELEIEGH. (Froo o o corrrpondent.) WE have been visited this last wook by Mr. W. Finchom, the bush missionary, who preaonched on Sunday morning last at MIr. Oox's, and in the oven ing at Mr. Peaoh's. Very fair congregationo assembled, and no doubt a great many morn would have booeen piresent if timely notice had boon given. On MIonday and Tuesday be visited the neighbours and disposed of a great number of boolks; and on W?Vdnesday left for Orookowell on route for the Lachlan. This is a very useful society, and though from limited means their operations are circum scribed, yet judging by the spiritual destitution of the interior, the Bush Miissionary Society will carry tlho gospel and nircoulato religious and inlstrunotivo books where otherwiose the people would be entirely denied these privileges. The weather still continues hot and dry. A ohower of rain would be a blessing. Fortunately bush-fires have not yet visited nous, though a careless idiot stoppod the other morning on the roadside to breakfast and left his fire burning. W'hen the wind sprang up the grass ignited, but was soon beaten out by some children and further progress rendered impossible. It would be well to mlake an example of one or two, as with the present hot woeather and long grass if the fire once got headway there is no knowing whero it would cnd. Foebruary 21st.
