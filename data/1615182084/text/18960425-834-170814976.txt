DISTRICT NEWS.- ' PITTSWORTH (FROM OUR OWN' CORRESPONDENT.) Now that we have got over our excitement about the elections, it is time that you had some news from here, and I am glad to inform your many readers that we are pro- gressing very satisfactorily. We have two additions to our tradespeople, viz.: one storekeeper and a blacksmith, and both are satisfied with then' prospects which, I sup- pose, is a sign that they were required. There is a likelihood of another butcher starting which will please our housekeepers, for the price of meat is out of all proportion to the price paid for stock. We have had another welcome addition to our town and that is Dr. Cooper, who intends to reside in Pittsworth. Although we are in a very healthy district, still, we are liable to acci- dents, etc., and it is comforting to have a medical man residing in the township, and as it is a large district there should a lucra- tive practice. Our young inhabitants have started a lawn tennis club, and have a good membership, so it ought to prove a real-live affair. It is very satisfactory to know that we are getting beyond the all-work and no play style of existence. Our cheese lactory made a start on the 7th April last, and although it will be handi- capped hy the season, it will be a great as- sistance to the dairy industry about here â€” for it will always keep up the prices in sum- mer ; hut if we have to start feeding from now until the spring there is not much in it. We have had very bad weather since the New Year through not getting our usual wet weather in February, and at present there are bush-fires at times which are very unusual at this time of the year, and speaks for itself about the dry season.
