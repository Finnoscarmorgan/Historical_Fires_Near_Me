NAVVIES AND" THE PUBLICAN." ; [BY TELEGRAPH.] A FRACAS of a rather serious character occurred at the Travellers' Best Inn on the Dongarra Road on Saturday night last. It appears that a number of navvies came to the house and demanded liquor on trust. Mrs. King, the wife of the proprietor, refused to serve them, whereupon the men indulged in violent abuse. When doing so King came home and remonstrated with the men, who turned on him threatening violence. King then armed himself with a gun. One of the men then struck King on the head with a heavy piece of timber inflicting a nasty wound. King then fired among the crowd and shot one man in the leg, but did not injure him seriously. BUSHFIRES (telegraphs our- Perth correspondent) are raging in all directions round York. THE inquest (telegraphs our Perth correspondent) upon the fire at Mr. H. Weisse's premises Packenham Street, Fremantle, concluded on Monday. The evidence went tp show the presence of traces of a large quantity of kerosene upon the floor of the shop, saturating many articles, but there is nothing to show how it came there. The jury returned an " Open Verdict."
