BUST IN WHEAT. TO TE EDITOR OF TIE QUEENSLAND TIMEB. Sm,-Bust broke out in the sugar plantations on the Mary Biver about the end of the sixties. Professor Livesidge was sent for from the South, and was occupied for three weeks inves. tigating the cause ot rust in the cane. ([pre sume all rusts are tbesame in effect). HIe said that it was a parasite that caused the evil, and recommended bush fires in the evepings round the cane patches. I was told of toacoompnuy the professor in his explorations amongst the fields. I saw the parasite through a micro scope of200-diameter magnifying power, and it looked to me just like the little crabs you see nunning into holes aboutthe Sandgate saltwater creek. (They have a name, but I cannot think of it). Smoke, he said, would kill them; there was no other remedy. I did not think of telling the professor that I had seen blady grass affected in the same way, especially grass that would not burn in the early spring. I think myself that the professor's advice was good. Bush-fires destroy the germs that are dormant about half-an-inch below the surface. Yours, SE., D. B. M'PHERSON.
