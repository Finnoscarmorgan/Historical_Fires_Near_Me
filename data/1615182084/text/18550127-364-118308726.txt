To the Editor of the Goulburn Herald. Sn,--I have been looking out for something like news, but as there is not anything startling, I am thrown back upon the old topic, the wea- tlier, but in this initance not by any means a bad besourc, as for some months back the different presses of the Colony have made the subject a very dry one, as nothing but drought with all its fears of the wheat-growing commu- nity was constantly before us, whilst we, the poor squatters, felt afraid to add our list of calamities to the numbers of the suffering. What with the general drought, and bush-fires for the last few weeks made us miserable in- deed ; but still, where are the trials that man is heir to ? which time and patience will not carry him through, as in this instance. Rain has come at last, and showered its blessings upon us, although not in any great quantities, but still sufficient to make us rejoice, as our recently blackened hills and valleys are now beginning to wear their green mantle once more, so we have every prospect of seeing our flocks and herds recover from the scarcity of feed which was causing them to lose their condition, and as it appears to have been general, no doubt plenty of others feel the buoyant hope besides our own favoured little district. I remain yours truly, MURRUMBIDGEE.
