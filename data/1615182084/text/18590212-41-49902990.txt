THE FIRES. TO THE EDITOr OP THE REGISTER Sir— On reading the reports in your daily issues of this week of the disastrous fires in the neighbourhood of Port Elliot, Macclesfield, and elsewhere, the thought naturally strikes those; who really condole with and are anxious to do something to relieve the imme- diate wants of the sufferers what would be the best mode of administering such relief; the thought which strikes me is this :— 1\. That a Committee be formed in each dis- trict where loss through the late lire has been sustained, for the purpose of receiving sub- scriptions and accounts of such loss, and in administering temporary aid. 2\. That a Central Committee be formed in Adelaide for the purpose of receiving subscrip- tions, the accounts from such District Com- mittees, and awarding such funds as they may have at their disposal. 3\. That the Lord Bishop of Adelaide (who I am sure only requires the suggestion) cause a general collection to be made in all the churches on Sunday, the 20th inst., for the purpose of relieving the sufferers, and that the amount of such collections be handed over to the Central Committee. I need not mention that churches of all other denominations would ba sure to render their accustomed liberal assistance on such occasions.. I am, Sir, &c.;, HUMANITAS.
