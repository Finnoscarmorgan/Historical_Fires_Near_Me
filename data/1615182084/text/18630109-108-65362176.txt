CORRESPONDENCE. We do not hold ourselves responsible for the oplrlious of our correspoidents. TO TIE EDITOR OF THE OIPPSLAND TtIES. SIR,-Bush fires that hare done much damage are thought by some people to be the work of maliciously disposed persons, because the injured parties cannot other wise account for the origin of the fires, commencing in out-of-the-way places where no one had camped. It may be of some use to mention to you that I recol lect a stockman having told me a few tears ago that, as he was riding home one tot day, he lighted his pipe, and then carelessly threw dtluw the match, without having first extinguished it. IHe then rode on at an easy pace for a short distance, enjoying his ,ipe, before he became aware that he had set .he bush on fire. le then galloped to the station and gave imme diate notice of the fire, but it was never suslected by any one that he had by his ownl ctarelessness burtt tihe rn. SA. settler has, sinlce then, informed me that-he onre day lighted his pipe and was careful in putting out the match, Iut, for all his care, the grass cauoght fire frum some of the burning tobacco havilg dropped out of his pipe. Other i,artias say that a bottle may start a bush-fire on a hot day. Yours faithfully, WILLIAM ANDERSON.
