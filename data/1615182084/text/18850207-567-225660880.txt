CHETWWD. (from our ow> correspondent.) Feb. 5. We are now busily engaged in harvesting, and from what I have seen of tbe crops, t have no hesitation in prognosticating a good . yield. Neither grubs nor caterpillars have t visited us, so in this respect we are more fortunate than onr down conn try friends. On the Glenelg the farmers are aleo getting in their crops, with which, I believe, they are perfectly satisfied. A large quantity of wattle bark has been forwarded to Portland this season, and it is satisfactory to note that that sent trom this district still maintains its reputation and commands the highest price. The local flour mill, wbich is now the property of Mr. j. Barrett, will resume operations in about a fortnight. The machinery is being overhauled, and every thing put in readiness, preparatory to mak ing a start. The first bush-fire of the season broke out last week in a paddock called 44 Smiling Valley " on tbe Cbetwynd estate. It quickly spread to Hillary's selection, and barnt down tbe house, and a quantity of fencing on the property, once occupied by tbe missing man. How the fire originated is at present unknown. A number of soldiers of the Salvation army have 44 opened fire " at Power's Greek, a bush settlement five miles distant. I have heard that their efforts have been so success ful that they intend to 44 attack" Eden- hope and Cbetwynd. I can assure tbem of a hearty reception at the latter place should they come.
