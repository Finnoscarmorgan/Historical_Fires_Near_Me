THE REVENUE RETURNS. The revenue returns for the year have been issued by the Treasury officials: — The returns just published are verjj satisfactory. - - The receipts for the year ending Thursday, the 30th ult., were L6,8SG,663, being an increase of L2' 6,446 over the revenue collected in 1896-7. Sir George Turner anticipated receiving -L173.583 more, so that he has obtained ' L83.000 above his estimate.. He estimated his- expenditure for. the ordinary purposes of government at L6, 636, 832, hut this sum may be exceeded, owing to the unex pected expenditure in connection with' the bush fires in February, and also the expenses of tlie Federation Convention, which were not provided for. Against this, however, will be various "savings," or unexpended votes, so that he ought' to be able to announce a surplus for the year of L200.000 or L250.000. This does not, of course, take into account the payment of the final insalment of the Shiels bonds, sold in January, 1893, am ounting to L250,000. These bonds were paid out of the trust funds, but even if they are reckoned as part of the ex penditure for the year the Treasurer has been not only able to pay his way during 1897-8, but to reduce the indebtedness of Victoria by L250.000. The Customs revenue came to LI, 840,502, being an increase of LSI, 122 on the previous year. In excise and in land revenue the Treasury has specially, benefited, the receipts being . L876.794, , or L164.750 more than was collected in. 1896-7. Nearly the whole of this large increase is to be attributed to tlie ab normal sums paid in probate duties, the wills of many wealthy colonists, notably. Sir William Clarke, Mr T. 13. Payne, Mr Peter Macarthur, and others having been proved, .aid the duty paid on them during the last twelve month?. The railway income amounted to L2, 604, 426, or L7171 above the sum received from that source last year. "Fees," which includes the sale of stamps, produced L7I1.S9S, or L20,000 in exce-s of the amount realised in 3S96-7. Miscellaneous returned L335.064, being L9500 above the sum obtained in the previous twelve months. There was, however, a decline of L28.04S in territorial revenue, the re ceipts being L3S4.924, as compared with L412.972 received in 1896-7. """ This fall ing off is attributable to the selectors having encountered such a bad season and heavy losses, owing to the bush- fires, that many of them could only pay, part of their rent.
