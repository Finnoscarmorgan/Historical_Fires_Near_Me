NOTES FROM LAGGAN. (Br Tooo fScsnow.) Trn weather is still keeping very dry, with terribly strong winds these last few days. We have an occasional thunderstorm, but owing to the ground being so dry these are of little or no benefit to the grass. N'othing less than a couple of days' rain would be of any use around this locality. On Friday lasta bushfire startedin fr.Naughton'e paddockls, about two miles from Laggan, and as the wind was very high it soon spread, burning about a thousand acres of grass and five miles of fencing. The residents are to be commended for the indefatigable manner in which they worlked to cope with the flames, but their efforts were almost fruit less on account of the power of the wind. A very enjoyable dance took place at Mr. T. M~Cormaeck, jun's., on Friday last. About thirty couple were present, and the greatest of good feeling seemed to predominate. The ladies all looked very nice, while the ubiquitous MI.C. (Mr. M. MieCor mack) was the right man in the right place. Dancing was indulged in till daylight. Tihe Laggan cricketers intend taking a trip to Kialla on Xomas afternooo to play that club. Ihear they intend puttingup a record score on that day. On Saturday last a hare drive took place at Mr. Cunningham's. Only six shooters put in an appearance, but these few were fairly "on the job," turning over about 89 of the destructive little animals. Mr. E. Bray with 27 anud MIessra. Howard and Gray with 20 each were the top scorers. Owing to the scarcity of wheat Messrs. Short and Co.'s mill only works a few days every week. It has just commenced to rain, with every appear ane of a continuance. 1Gth December.
