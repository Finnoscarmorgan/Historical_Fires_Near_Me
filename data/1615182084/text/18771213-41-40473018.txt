CHEISTMAS PICNICS AND SCHOOL FETES. TO THE EDITOB. Sir— The notice from the Chief Secretary's Office now advertised in the Gazette and daily papers that the penalties of the Bushfires Act will be enforced has been issued in sood time for tne coming holidays, but will do little good m the neighbourhood of Adelaide unless the police and District Rangers and constables have special instructions to be on the lookout. At every recurrence of holidays the hills, gullies, and plains near town are the scenes of school fetes, picnics, and excursions, and on nearly every occasion in summer time destructive fires result from ignorance and carelessness in using fire arms and teakettles. This is particularly the case at school fetes. No sooner have the chil dren left the omnibuses than the hoys are off with guns — blazing away at everything from pigeons and poultry to birds and butterflies. Cats are good game ; haystacks fair targets and old newspaper capital wadding. Whilst the youngsters are banging around, and the girls singing and swinging, the oldsters light a fire in a hollow tree, or on a nice place where there is plenty of dry grass to sit on. The consequence is that there is a flare-up then and there, or soon after the pleasure parties have quitted the scene, and the sacrifice of tea and buns is followed by that of fences, crops, and other property. Now this ought to be stopped, but a Gazette notice won't do it. What is wanted is that the organizers, managers, and superintendents of these affairs should be held personally answerable for all damage in connec tion with their parties. They would then see that no guns were taken on the busses, no fires lit in dangerous places or left smouldering when done with ; and the object of this letter is to call the particular attention of clergymen, schoolmasters, Oddfellows, Rechabites, and the rest during holiday times to the penalties of the Act, and the danger of -_-——_— FIRE.
