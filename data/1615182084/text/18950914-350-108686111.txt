Mulgoa. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) WEATHER AND CROPS. The continued dry weather with the high winds are causing much alarm in this district. Feed is very scarce, and water is getting short; cattle are looking very bad, and numbers are dying. The creeks and dams are drying up very fast now that the warmer days have set in. Bush fires are raging almost all round us, doing much damage. Unless we get rain before long the fruit crops will be spoiled for this season ; the green crops will also be a failure, very little hay will be grown, and we shall have no grass. Altogether the out- look is not very promising. The whole place is enveloped is smoke, and the wind, bringing the heat of the bush fires with it, has given us a taste of real summer weather. Thanks to the Irrigation Works we have a small water supply which keeps the people in the village supplied, otherwise they would have been badly off for water at the present time.
