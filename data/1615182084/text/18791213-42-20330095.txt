PORT CURTIS. December 5. Matters pastoral are not in the way of mending with us here as yet, for in addition to the absence of any market for surplus stock, there is now the prospect of little to feed the too numer- oub herds around us, aa a very large proportion of the country has been dean swept by bush fires. Where the oountry has by any chance escaped this disaster a fair supply of grass still remains, but it is mostly where the precaution was taken as early aa possible since the growing season commenced to burn the grass that the best feed is now to be seen. Evidently we have entered upon a drought, but how long it may continue none can say, and in the present state of the country it cannot be endured for any length of time without causing much distress and loss, both to cattle owners and culturists. Sales of stock of any description are harder to effect no* than formerly, owing no doubt chiefly to the unsatisfactory turn the season has taken, attd to the absence of any assuring prospect in the future. Store cattle occasionally change bands at ridiculously low figures, but little over 41 per head ; fats, however, have commanded a trifle over former quotations owing to the rise in tal low, but the prospect of such rates continuing is very dim. At present matters agricultural are in as lan guishing a condition as pastoral ones, crops once full of promise now look like failure, and except that creeks and waterholea still contain a full supply of water there is very great need of a plentiful downpour.
