SBATSJNCHUROII. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. I Sir,-A' fact not generally known to the crowds that assemble at the doors of some of . our fashionable Anglican churches, "in waiting to be shown to a seat," is that, directly the clergyman pronounces the first word of the service, but not until then, every unoccupied sitting in the building is absolutely free, and may be entered upon by any persons who ploase to toke possession of tbcm, and may be lawfully occupied by them without let or hindrance. during the re- mainder of the service, providod they con- duct themselves with propriety. This freedom of sittings is provided m Clause 39 of tho Trasteos and Vestries Act, passed by the Church Assembly at its last session in October, 1871\. Copies of the act which came into operation on the 1st December ult. can be obtained at the Bishop's Registry. As a member of the Church Assembly myself I consider it desirable, in the interests of that body as well as of the public, that this law of the church should bo both gene- rally known and generally acted on, as nothing will tend more to produce practical legislation on the part of the assembly than the bringing of the laws it doos make into activo operation. Be it remembered then in [ futuro that application to a verger for a seat, after Divine servico has commencedt is quite unnecessary, as every empty soat is free to everybody to choose from. One excellent' effect of this enactment will doubtless be| manifest in the early attendance at church; which it will induce, as seatholders cani secure their sittings only by occupying them before Divine service commences.-I am, Sir, ' your obedient servant, : B.
