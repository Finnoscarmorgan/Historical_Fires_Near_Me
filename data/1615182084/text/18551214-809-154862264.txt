The master of the barque Matador reports, that at 9-20 p.m., on Wednesday, a collision look place be tween his vessel and the steamer Queen, oil Cape Patton. The Queen came in contact with the Mata dor at her fore chains on the port side, staving in her rails, stanchions, and tearing away part of her rigging. After the collision, Capt. Hicks inquired if the Queen had sustained much damage, and was in formed that the bow-sprit, jib-boom and figure-head had been carried away, and her bows stove. 1 art of the figure-head of the Queen was afterwards nicked up on the deck of the Matador. The barque -Matador and schooner Agnes report having seen on the evening of the 9th inst., when off Cape Northumberland, a fire : but as bush-fires are of freauent occurrence on that shore, anu after the warm weather which we had at that timo,_ there is but little doubt that such was the cause of this fire.
