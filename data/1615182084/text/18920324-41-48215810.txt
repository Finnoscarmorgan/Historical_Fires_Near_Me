CORONER'S INQUEST. FIRE AT BALHANNAH. Mr R. Drummond and a Jury held an in- quest at Balhannah on March 21 on a bush- fire which occurred at that place on March 4. John Clasohm stated that when he first saw the fire on his property he was about a mile distant in company with Mr Schuetz. He had no idea how the fire started. The fire had done damage to the fences. William Childs said he did not try to put the fire out on his property, as it was burning too strongly. The fire could have been stopped when he first saw it if two or three persons had been available. The Jury returned a verdict to the effect that the fire occurred near Balhannah on March 4, having started on Mr John Clasohm's property, but there was not sufficient evidence to show the origin of same, and they added a rider to the effect that the witnesses Childs and Clasohm be censured for the unsatisfactory manner in which they gave their evidence.
