BLACKALL. February 18. Fine rain has fallen at Blackall. and as it has Fine rain has fallen at Blackall, and as it has it may prove to be so. The rain fell through a period of about twelve hours, at times in smart showers, but not as yet sufficiently heavy to make much water. It will, however, give the grass a fine start, which was much wanted, as, from the long continuance of dry weather and the destruction caused in the grass by bush fires, feed was in some places becoming un- pleasantly scarce, although I have not heard of any actual loss. On the contrary, stock has been doing remarkably well, and if this rain has been general, all inconvenience from scarcity of feed will be removed ; but more and heavier rain is required to replenish exhausted waterholes ; more especially on the dry country between the Barcoo and the Thomson Rivers; not only for the use of the stock, but also to enable dam making operations to be car- ried on, as there are large tracts of country there, entirely destitute of water; after a short interval of dry weather, enough not even being procurable to keep the men at work, without carting it long distances. February 19. I am informed by the manager of Lorne, who came in last night, that the rain did not extend to that station, and that they will be badly off for grass for lambing. Also, a gentleman from the Thomson yesterday informed me that the rain only reached about five miles past Avington, down the river. So that it was only a local rain after all. There has been no movement of stock lately, owing, I presume, to the scarcity of feed on the roads ; but now that rain has fallen, and grass likely to be abundant, this state of things will, no doubt, soon be altered. The only cattle that have passed are 30 head fat, from Avington, for the butcher at Tambo. I believe Mr. James Nisbet's sheep (13,000) from Springsure, for the Western River, are on the road, but I have not heard of their whereabouts.
