TRARALLGIPN SOUTH. (FROM OUR OWN CORBRSPONDINT.) January 6. A well attended meeting of the Mechanics' Institute committee was held inqthe schoolroom on Saturday night. Mr.i: Jones was voted to the chair, and the minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed. The chairmari with Messrs. Powell and Nicholson were appointed a works committee to supervise the erection of the building It was decided, on the motion of MLessrs. Nicholson and Kirby, that the size of the building be 40 x 50 feet. It was also decided that the next meeting be held on the 25th inst., when all moneys collected should be handed in, after which the erection of the building will be proceeded with. The committee have already cleared the site granted to them by the De partment, and it was decided that the secretary write to the shire council asking them to remove a few trees from the road in front of the proposed build ing. The Institute, when erected, will be an acquisition to Traralgon South, as a hall of some kind is badly needed here, the accommodation for meetings, entertainments, &c.;,being very limited at present. A tea-meeting, to celebrate the anni versary of the local Sunday School, will be held in the church on Tuesday evening next, when no doubt there will be a good attendance of scholars and the public. The weather has been very hot for a considerable time past, and the grass is drying up fast; a good shower of rain would be very acceptable now. Owing to the length and quantity of grass there will, no doubt, be some bush-fires beom the nsmmer is over.
