BUSHFIRE AT CLARENDON Clarendon, may 3 An inquest on the bushfire which occurrerd. at the. Meadows on tbe property of Mr. George Vickery on the 26th of April was held at the Meadows Hotel to-day before Mr. Thomas Shipway J.P. coroner, Mr Charles Nottage being, foreman ol the Jury. Mr. Vickery stated that his place was uninsured , and he therefore estimated his loss at £300. The evidence showed the fire first originated in the Wattle Company 's property, supposed to have been started by some person or persons unknown who were out oppossum shooting and had lit a fire for the purpose of roasting some,, as some skins were found close by where the fire started. The Jury brought in a verdict in accordance with the evidence, but there was nothing to show who the person or persons were. Mounted Constable Mathews conducted the case on behalf of the police. Our correspondent also writes :— ''The fire which I reported in Mr. Dix's property last night was not so destructive as was at first anticipated as through the exertions of the neighbours it was confined to the scrubs and really did more good |than harm. with the exception of burning a line or two of fencing, for Mr. Dix . The rain, which started early this morning, has continued alL day,, with some very heavy showers, and there is every indication of it continuing.'
