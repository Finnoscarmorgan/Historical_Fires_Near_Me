AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS OF ,EW' SOUTH WALES. Tan agricultural statistics of New South Wales in connection with the census of 1891 have lately been issued. They show that during the last agricultural year 333,233 acres were cropped with wheat, the grain produce of which amounted to 3,649,210 bushels, or a little over. three bushels per head of the whole population, while the consumption has been about six and a-half bushels per head. During the year ending March 31, 1890, the colony had 419,758 acres of wheat, the produce of which was 6,570,3385 bushels, or at the rate of 15685 bushels to the acre, as against 10"95 bushels to the acre for the year just closed. There were 191,152 acres cropped with maize for grain, the produce from which was 5,713,205 bushels, being a greater yield than has ever been recorded in the colony before, the nearest being that of the previous year, when there was an area of 173,836 acres and a yield of 1,354,827 bushels. It must however be pointed out that although the total quantity produced last year exceeds that of the year previous, the rate per acre vas 30"8 in the year which ended with March 1890, as against 29'9 bushels per acre for last year. The highest yield per acre recorded since 1862 was in 1870, when it rose to over thirty-eight bushels to the acre. Strange to say, this was succeeded by the smallest yield, 21-8 bushels in the year 1871. The average for thirty years is a little over thirty bushels to the acre. The bullk of the maize crop, over 3,500,000 bushels, came from the nort4heru division and chiefly from the coast districts. Last year 4937 acres of barley were grown for grain, 938 for hay, and 2267 for green feed. The produce was 81,383 bushels of grain and 1179 tons of hay. The average was 10648 bushels of grain and 1"28 tons of hay to the acre. Of oats, there were 14,102 acres grown for grain, producing 2586,59 bushels, or at the rate of 18"20 bushels to the acre, while there were 70,463 acres cut for hay, the produce of which was 71,305 tons or 1-01 ton to the acre. Besides these there were 14101 acres of oats cut for green feed. The country also produced 9129 bushels of rye, 2417 bushels of millet, 44,526 tons of hay, 52,791 tons of potatoes (which shoe an average of 2"72 tons to the acre), 14,021 tons of tobacco leaf (or an average of 12-21 cwt. per acre), and 277,252 tons of sugarcane (or an average of 32"23 tons' to the acre). The total wine produce for the year was 842,181 gallons, or 21,617 gal lons per acre, being the largest quan tity ever produced in one year. Among other miscellaneous crops there were 770,800 cases of oranges, gathered from 8737 acres of orchards, and there are, in addition, 2551 acres in which the trees are not yet bearing. Of other fruits there were 16,081 acres productive, and 6271 acres not bear ing. The value of the fruit produced was £213,034. Mixed gardens pro duced crops to the value of £192,597, and chicory was grown to the value of £312. Peas and beans were gathered to the extent of 14,470 bushels, and pumpkins and melons were produced to the weight of 13,981 tons. The value of other miscellaneous crops raised was £34,503. There were 1589 instances wherein the crops failed. Of these 957 were from flood, 88 from drought, seven from bush-fires, 45 from rust, 113 from locusts, 21 from vermin, 14 from hail-storms, 220 from excessive rain, 11 from blight, two from flying foxes, and 151 from causes not specified. "You hove bean so long about the minister's hand, John, that I daresay you culd preach a sermon yourself now," said a gentleman one day to a beadle of Mussolburgh. " Oh, na, sir," replied John, "I couldna preach a sermon, but I can draw an inference though." "Well, John," said the gentleman, humouring the quiet vanity of the beadle, " what inference could you draw from this text: ' A wild ass S. . enuffoth up the wind at her pleasnro ? ' " (Jeremiah ii, 24.) " Weel," repliel John, "the only natural-like inferenca that I could draw frae it is just this--that she wad snuff a lang time afore she would fat. ten on it."
