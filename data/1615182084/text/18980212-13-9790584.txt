CLOTHING FOR BURNT-OUT SETTLERS The society of St. Vincent de Paul despatched yesterday eight bales of clothing and bedding to Nerrim South, Bunyip, South Sassafras, and Nyora. The following contributions are now acknow- ledged : - Four parcels from unknown donors, one from "A Friend," and one from C. C. Victoria- street, Fitzroy. The applications for bedding and baby and children's clothing are numerous, and the society having almost exhausted its stock in these lines would fell grateful for further dona- tions in order to supply many urgent cases now on its books.
