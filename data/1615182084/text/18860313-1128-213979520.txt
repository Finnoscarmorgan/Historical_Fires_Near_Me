A COMPLAINT. To the Editor of the Victorian Express. Sib. â€” I am a poor man, and as your columns are open to the poor as well to as the rich, I hope you will allow me a little space. I am a heavy sufferer bv the recent bush-fires, the grass hav- ing been burned for miles around me. My horses in consequence strayed looking for feed, and chance brought them upon Mugawah Com monage. Now there does not seem to be much harm in their feedingtheir way to the Commonage. It is already well-stocked in cattle and sheep, and why I should be singled oat, my horses driven away, and myself abused and threatened, I can not conceive. The Commonage Reserve is most uu justly monopolised by two three persons, who will allow no one else to use the reserve. I read recently of a case wherein a poor man a short time ago was brought before the Magis trate for tiking a little wood off Crown Lands without a license, and in this case the vigilance of the police wa6 commended. They cannot be commended for their vigilance in this locality, unless it is for watching and waiting for tip plers going home at night. But they are cer tainly familiar and obliging to a few, and from their long standing in the district the police come to be almost regarded as settlers, which should not be. Ynnrs trulv.
