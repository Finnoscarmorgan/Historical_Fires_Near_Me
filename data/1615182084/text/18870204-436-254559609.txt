NORTH BERRYJERRY. SATURDAY, January 22. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) We have had very hot weather until Wednesday last, when a sudden change came, dull weather with easterly winds and cool nights prevailing. A large busbfire was burning down Coolaman way. It started on Tuesday. We also had a heavy duststorm in the evening, bringing up clonds of dust and smoke, and making it appear as if the whole country was on fire. I have not heard if it has done much damage, Mr. W. Laurence, an old resident of the Corowa district, has a fine selection on Big Mimosa. I see be is one of the few selectors who believe in a good garden. It doe; not look very promising at present, the dry weather and grasshoppers having destroyed everything in the vegetable line. He has a fine trellis of the currant grape, with very large bunches of fruit on the vines. He also has some very good pumpkin and melon vines, but the hares (which are plentiful about here) destroy the fruit on tbem, especially the melons, as fast as tbey get ripe. | You made a mistake in the last letter I sent you. I said Mr, M'Donald had a cancer taken from his lio, not hip.
