BUSH FIRE. * THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir,—We have had a most frightful visitation here yesterday, in the shape of a bush- fire. Being a fearfully hot day, as most people well know, I remarked a dense cloud of smoke around my place about mid day. (As many people have, I dare say, never heard of this part, I may as well inform them that it lies east of Boroondara, nine miles from Melbourne.) As I was saying, it was evident to me that a great fire was not far off. Keeping an anxious watch, I soon saw the crown of the hill above me in a blaze. A fierce north or hot wind was bringing it down rapidly upon me. Destruction seemed inevitable. I was rather short- handed ; nevertheless, males and females turned out, and used every endeavor to arrest the progress of the destructive element ; but all would, I believe, have been in vain had not my neighbor, Mr. Patrick Trainor, of the White Horse Inn (to whom my grateful acknowledgments are due), come up with a posse of men, and with their assistance my house and the chief part of my premises were saved. Still, by the loss of a large barn, a stack of hay, a large part of a fine orchard laid bare, and considerable fencing burnt, I must have sustained a loss of £500. Nevertheless, I am grateful, when my nearest neighbor, a Mr. Shelton, has been entirely cleared out of house, outbuildings, and this season's stacks. I write this hurriedly, soon after the accident; but I feel assured you will hear much more of the evil done in this neighborhood by the scandalous conduct of wilful or careless persons in setting fire to the grass. I am, Sir, yours obediently, ARUNDEL WRIGHTE. Beaudesert, Nunawading, Jan. 28,1858. P.S.—Since writing the above, I heard that several people have been burnt out between Bulleen and this. A. W.
