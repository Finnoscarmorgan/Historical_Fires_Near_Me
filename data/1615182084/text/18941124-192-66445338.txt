Saukville. We caa always do here with three good square meats a day. Since the storm happened the crops have rallied a good deal, and the farmers who suffered are in better spirits. The bush-fires cleared a lot of country out down this way, but we saved, after a day's struggle, most of the fences. The Scotch thistles have received their death blow, and this old historical place, with its beauti ful surroundings, will always be productive of some good.

After a hard day's work, I frequently made a big splash in the river, and thought nothing of swim ming across the reach from bank to bank, and then go and cook my supper. After about six hours sleep I was at it again as fresh as a lark, and the crops raised in those days were worth looking at.

My old dog Driver, used to clear out all the snakes in a short time. This season a lot of snakes have been destroyed about the swamp. De Rome's nephew told me the other day one was killed at their place measur ing 9ft in length. Another was despatched by De Rome, nearly the same length. Both were the black species. What will the naturalists say to that. I am of the opinion that larger ones are to be found about Hall's swamp. I remember seeing a portion of a black snake one day, crawl ing down a hole, that would have frightened me had I attempted to kill it.
