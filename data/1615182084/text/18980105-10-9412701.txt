LOSSES AT HUONVILLE. Mr Charles Oates writes; - "I had destroyed by fire during Friday last—One saw mill, all complete ; cottage of two rooms, hut, blacksmith's shop and tools, timber waggon and wheels; a cow shed, to hold 20 cows, 60ft long by 40ft ; 100 apple trees in full bearing burnt, and apples roasted ; about 1½ mile tram- road and bridges, 14 chains 14 x 2 water troughing, and 1½ mile of fencing, one 6-stall stable (weatherboard). One cottage of 5 rooms caught fire several times, but we managed to save it. Also a house of 8 rooms was saved after many hours of labour. My pigs are burnt ; many of the cows scorched, the hair being burnt off them ; and all the fencing about the farm is burnt, not leaving one rood. I am not insured for anything. "Mr. Hennigan, adjoining my farm, also got many apple trees burnt, besides the whole of his fencing and sheds. He saved his house and barn. "The water in Mountain River, where the fire crossed, is full of roasted fish, many hundreds lying about, the water being very low."
