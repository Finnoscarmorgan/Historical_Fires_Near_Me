NEW SOUTH WALES. SYDNEY, November 14. The result of the meeting of delegates, re- garding the difficulties raised in regard to the Minnie colliery, are now known. Nothing has been done as yet, but it is believed that the proprietors will made the local concessious demanded by the men. The Board of dele- gates have passed resolutions deprecating the sentences passed upon the colliers for riots and they have resolved to support the families dependent on the sentenced men. Terrible bushfires have occurred at Gel- gandra in the Dubbo district. Lesser fires are reported from other parts of the colony. Great distress and consternation prevails amongst the squatters and monetary insti- tutions at the continued drought. Thous- ands of sheep and other stock are dying. A water faminine exists in many places in this and the adjoining colonies. It is hard to say which is suffering most.
