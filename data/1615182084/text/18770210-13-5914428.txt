COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argua Office, Friday Evening. In the import market business to-day has been quieter than usual, and scarcely a transaction to which the slightest interest is attached has been allowed to transpire. In most of the staples which attracted so mach attention of late there is nothing whatever doing, and the markot, thoa left to an ordinary routine trade demand, continues to present a very dall aspect. In bread stuffs we are without any sales of flour to refer to. Quotations stand at £11 12s, 6d. to £U 15s" but sales are restricted to the quittance ot small lots Wheat is doing better than was anticipated ; we bave not heard of any sales under Gs 5d and Ga Gd, and at the latter price a parcel of 1,000 bags is said to have changed hands. Oats are very firm ; sales ot fine stout feeding have been made at 3a. 9Jd., and a parcel of good milling has beenplaceilat3a. lOd. Maizs is moving at 3s. lOd. and 3s lid. TeaB are inquired for, and business is ponding. Trans- actions in sugar have not been of much ac count; a feeling of confidence favourable to the market ia springing up, which promises to lead to increased trade. Telegrams have been received to day which confirm the com, plete reaction which has occurred in London, A few days ago the advance reported was only 5s. per ton ; to-day it ¡b £2 per ton, with the market firm, and having a rising ten. dency. Swiss cigars are coming into notice. We hear of a line of 20 coses having been taken np at a full price. Manillas aro rising in value, owing to the loss of 45 oases in the Singapore at a time when the stock here is light; the advance required now over last month's quotations is Gs to 7s., the price having risen from 55a. to C23. We learn that owing to the high price of 1 sugar and the scarcity of fruit, the Victorian ' Preserving Company have raised the price of | their red cross brand of jams to 6b. 6d. for parcels. The Castoras revenue collected at the port 1 of Melbourne this day amounted to £5,939 18s.; pilotage, £91 Is. 8d. , We report as follows of the stock and share market : Mining business still princlpdly la Egerton cora» panies, bath Black Horse and Egerton bolng doatt in 1 at rising ratos, tho latter especially realising large i advances.
