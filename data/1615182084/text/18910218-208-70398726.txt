FRANKSTON. (From our own Correspondent) At the beginning of last week an extensive bushfire took place here, which although bravely fought by the local fire brigade and other towns people did a great deal of damage. We had another visitation from the devouring element on Saturday at about two o'clock. It was first observed that the scrub and under growth about two miles from Frankston towards Carrum was on fire. A strong wind from the north was blowing at the time and the fire spread rapidly, both sides of the Melbourne road being on fire; also the railway line, where some chains of fencing were destroyed. The Frankston Fire Brigade turned out and rendered great assistance in preserving property from the flames. The Half-way House hotel on the long beach was completely surrounded by fire, and it was thought at one time impossible to save Mr Bennett's house. During the night gangers , were stationed on the railway line to prevent flames spreading to the sleepers. The fire burnt itself out during Sunday. The fire brigade worked splendidly, and Superintendant Fox deserves a special word of praise for the standard of efficiency, to which he has raised the local brigade. The brigade, I am told, is in debt to the extent of about Â£140, and in view of the sterling work they are showing, this should not be hard to raise. The Frankston regatta is to be held on the 20th March instead of the 17th as previously notified, as it is thought that more entries will be received for the later date. The candidates for the extraordinary vacancy in the Council, Messrs; Harriman and Box are energetically canvassing the district. Meetings have been held and votes of confidence passed on both gentlemen.
