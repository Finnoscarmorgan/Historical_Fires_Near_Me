To the Editor of the Sydney Herald Sir,- During the last few days we have had some refreshing showers in this neighbourhood which were much wanted, in order to stop the dreadful and alarming bush-fires occasioned by a number of strange "poor blacks" who have made their appearance here, and have, with impunity set fire to the bush for many miles round, three of them are armed with muskets, and have plenty of ammunition and money, besides about twenty dogs, which they failed not to dog our cattle and sheep with, the former, to a head left the run, and my stockman has rode three horses nearly to death to bring them back, but now there are about fifty missing, upon remonstrating with the "black cannibals" on their very improper conduct, they answered, that I had too much b_ _ _ _y gammon. I would ask, what are our protector gentlemen about, and the Bishop 0f Australia with his Church Missionary friends? It appears, that the black marauders are to have full liberty from the authorities, to trespass on a man's farm, and drive his cattle and sheep into the gullies, to serve then own diabolical purposes, while white men professing the Christian religion, who live and hope to die in the faith delivered to the Saints contained in the Holy Scriptures, are afraid to speak or protect their own property, least Jack Ketch should be waiting for his fee. AMU.. Murray. April 16th, 1839.
