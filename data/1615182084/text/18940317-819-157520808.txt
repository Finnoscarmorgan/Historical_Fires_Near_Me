FEKGUSOJST. (From our Correspondent.) March 12 The return cricket match between the Preston and Ferguson Clubs was played here to-day. It was glorious weather for cricket. Both teams turned up at 10*30 a.ui. After the first two innings had been played the cricketers adjourned to do justice to an excellent luncheon which had been generously provided by some of our good ladies. On the game being resumed the Ferguson men went to work with renewed energy, defeating their opponents by an easy win of one innings. Sickness has been prevalent in this district lately and I can only account for it by the weather which has not been altogether seasonable. Bushfires are raging in this neigh bourhood but I have not yet heard of any special damage being done. Wheu Mr. James Fowler was returning from Dardanup the other day with his team the horses took fright and bolted. Fortunately tbe driver escaped uuhurt but the cart was smashed.
