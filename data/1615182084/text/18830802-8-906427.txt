Disastrous Bush Fire at Gerringong. (By Telegraph to the Herald.) Kiama, Saturday. About mid-day yesterday a terrific westerly gale commenced, and for 12 hours, almost without intermission, a perfect hurricane swept over the district. At Gerringong the forest timber to the west of the township became ignited, and, aided by the strong wind, the fire rapidly spreading from tree to tree, the neighbourhood was soon in a con- flagration, threatening destruction to valuable property. Telegrams were despatched to Kiama, seven miles distant, for help, and the appeal was promptly responded to; but despite the utmost exertions on the part of many persons to beat back the flames, some six or seven homesteads were consumed. To-day, the wind being still pretty strong, the fire rapidly approached the village of Gerringong, causing the utmost alarm; and in response to an appeal for further help, a number of people from Kiama went out to render what assistance they could. When the latest reports reached town to-day it was said that many hands were still battling bravely with the flames, which had reached the village, and one at least of the local stores had been emptied of its contents. Eleven years ago Gerringong passed through a similar ordeal, the village being then almost laid in ashes. Many of the principal buildings were on that occasion swept out of existence in the space of a couple of hours. During the 11 years since the disaster there has not been a gale approaching in fury the one which visited us yesterday. Last night at times it was almost impossible to stand against the wind, and it speaks well for the substantial character of the buildings in this town that they sustained so little damage.
