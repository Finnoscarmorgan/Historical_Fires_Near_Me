IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL EN- TERPRISE. Cnnrsmx Brothers' School at Ncxdah 1 Creek. 1 During the past three months a largo college for the institute in connection with the Christian Brothers' School has been in piocess of erection near Nundah Creek, on a site lymg between three and four miles fiom Sand gate, on the Brisbane road The fiist purchase of land for the instituto was 258 acics adjoin ing tho present site, but it was found to bo too low lying for this purpose An additional purchase of 45 acres was, therefore, sub«e quontly mado This mcludod the last high ridge on the Sandgate road (since named Collego Hill), on which the piesent building has finally been erected The total area of tue land is thus 303 acres This site is bounded the south west by tho Sandgate road, on the east and south cast by Nundah Cicek, on the notth cast by the North Coast Railway, and on the north- west by a Government road, which luns into the Brisbane Sandgate load Hie present struct mo is the fust conti act, costing £0050, of a building which will eventually cost £24,000, the portion now elected constituting the north west flout wing Xho building is constructed of buck and oonorete, and comprises thiee stones and a basement, presenting a total height of 45ft The other dimensions aie Depth, 92ft, frontage to Sandgate load, 94ft At the back of the building an observation tower rises fiom the îoof, the floor of which is at an altitude of about 130ft A splendid panoramio view is obtainable from tho top of this tower Moioton Bay stretches far away on the one hand, St Helena, Moleton Island, Humpybong, and Sandgate, being distinctly visible, while towaids the south east the Enoggera langes and the city present a most atti active scene THE DOILDINO ITÖKLF is veiy commodious The basement is devoted to cellarage and other

is richly panelled, and stands 2m ov er the face of the suppoiting wall Foliated brackets of nch design support each step, and, apparently, grow one out of another The face of the steps is richly panelled, the panels, together with tho nosing under the steps, being woiked up m colouied plaster Ihe newell, or upright post, has evidently taxed tho designor s ingenuity Pc is of a veiy olaboiato

veranda reached by a pi mi te stairoase lho sanitary ai rangements piovided are of the best description Water is laid on to tho building fiom a cistern in the top Btoiy containing 2500 gallons fed by a steam pump from one of three underground tanks One of tho latter just comjileted has a capacity of SO 000 gallons Watci for the rouchel domestic purposes will be pumped by steam from Nundah Cicek Behind the college a lar^e gymnasium, 32ft by 80ft, has been elected Ono of the most suitable roaches m Nundah Cicok is being cleaned out nnd prepared as a bathing place for tho students , and it is expeoted to provide a very good one at an expendituie of £100 Hie collego presents a handsome and sub stantinl appearanoo from tho road being built in a classic Italian sty le, combining intense solidity w ith a certain amount of grace and beauty Messrs A Stombueo and Sons (now Stombuoo, Coutts, and Co ) weio the nichitects, and Messrs Bowes and O Shea tho conti actors for the work The architects speak very highly of the expedition with which the con tract has been carried out Tho institute vv ill assume its educational functions in a couple of months Tho new school will, wo believe, be used in connection with that now m uae on Gregoiv terrace, which latter, though extended duung îecent yeais has pioved too small for the demands mado upon it Dm m g tho )ears that tho marsupial post was felt most severely in Queensland the moitahty amongst sheep from " worm disease was gieatest This fact was noticed by manv p ac tical men, and if the worms weio not attributed to the marsupials man) favoured tho belief that there was some connection between the two Investigations conducted in England with le terence to lung worms go fm to show that although the piesence of immense numbers of marsupials on tho pastuie was not the cause of the " worm disease ' they may be, nnd probably weie, one of the most fruitful causes of dis sominating tlio woims It was proved during the English investigation* that in distnets where lung worm was prevalent in calves and lambs the earthworms weie also affected and the presumption was that theso caithworms expel the embr)os after they hove advanced to a certain stage of development These are taken up bv grazing animal«, and it is but natuial to suppose that the more numcious the grazing animals the greater the facilities for tho spread of the wonns Another fact came to light dunng the English inquiry tatthworms from distnets in which parasitic lung disease appears every autumn, or earlier if the season is wet, wore found to be free from embryos during the drv hot period of the summer \s soon as tho disease reappeared among calves and lambs, after a consideiable rainfall, the earthworms again become affected The embrvos also re mained dormant on the pasture during a dry season, but hecame active on the recurrence of the rainy season Here then, are the condi tions under which Queensland flocks are visited bv the " wonn disease " It is generally supposed that it is caused bv a " flush of grass ' (following on a drought) in which tneie is veiy little nutrition but in these dava when gponta neous generation has been prov ed to be a fallacy, few inquirers will endorse that theorv The genii must bo lurking in the pasture before the animaU are nttackel, and when "worm disease" is prevalent razien, would do well to adopt Mr Halv a sound advice and burn off everv portion of pasture they can spare In this wav, and in tin-, way only, can the germs be destroved Mi Halv has truly said that when we tool ovcrthe australian pastures from the aborigines we mhentel the healthiest pastures in the world It is well known that before the pastures were occupied by the white man the countrv or very large portions of it were annually burnt bv the blacks to assist them m procuring food, and old colonists know that without the renovating effect of bushfires large areas of country that formerlv provided good pastuie for sheep are now almost totally ' useless.-Queenslander*
