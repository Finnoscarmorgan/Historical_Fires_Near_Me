THE GIPPSLAND BUSI FIES. MEETING AT NORTI" MELtOURNE. ON Fridayi evening a meeting convened by the 'Mayor (Or. W.aDICK), to take steps to aid the sufferers by the above conflngrations, was he d in the upper room of the Town Hall. The Chairman-the convener-ex plaino:l the object of the meeling, and said that " the people of North Mel bourne had never been behind hand in the cause of charity. Such a enlamity as th:it which had caused 'theni to as semble that evening, le felt sure, touched the hearts of all, and he hoped and be lieved, it wuldl their pocketes alo. He would call on the mover of the first mo tion to move the same. Mr. W. A. Watt, M.L.A., moved as follows:--'" That this meeting expresses sympathy with the unfortunate sufferers by the catamitous bush-fires through the colony, and resolves to do everything in its power to afford them prompt and iracticl assistance." The speaker said that all were aware of the nature and extent of the disaster, which was without a parallel in the history of Victoria. They read of settlers burnt out, and having to see the result of the labor of years and years consumed in a few hours. They had some idea of what the ravages of fire. wmre in the city. with trained men and appliances to exting uish the same to hand; and they could form some notion of uncontrollable miles of flame in the thick bush. They were determined to do somtething, althlough, no doubt, they would not be able to do all they would like. The Mayor of Mel bourne's fund had reached £2,000, and the Argus fund was nearly as large. As they did not meet that, night to hear speeches, but to do something practical, he would not detain them longer. Mr. G. Gibbius seconded the resolu tion, which was carried. Canon Carlisle moved:-" That a coummittee be furued to canvass for sub scriptions, and that the mayor be trea surer." They often heard it said that " He gives twice who gives quickly," and this was a .case in which the spirit of that saying should be carried out. He would canvass his own congregation, and do all in his power. The people who had gone into the bush were those with a strong arm and a strong heart. They woere the yeomanry of the colony. A great divine had said: "Axe work drives the devil out of a mian,;" and the characters of these bush pioneers were notable for their honesty and integrity. Certainly the fires had cleared the coun try for them--a task they often found very hatrd; and the land would be better after the burnings; but, meanwhile, they were standing up in nothing but rags. He moved the resolution standing in his name. Mr. Clement Davidson seconded it. He felt sure there would be a ready re sponse to these appeals. Recently he had been in Tasmanain, and when he saw the terrible results of the fires there he spoke to some friends who were with him about getting up a fund, but when they returned to Melbourne, they found theywonuldhar quite_ enoughtoAs dfo Victorian sufferers. The Y.M.C.A.swoull do all in their power; and, indeed, hl believed everyone would, as the appeal was a most pitiful one, and could not be disregarded by the most apathetic. The motion was carried. The proceedings closed with ie usual compliment to the chairman; and that gentleman then entertained those pre sent in the council chambers.
