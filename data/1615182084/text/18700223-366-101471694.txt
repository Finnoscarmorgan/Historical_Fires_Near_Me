WHEEO. (From our correspondent.) SANITARY.-I am sorry to say that sickness has been very prevalent in this neighbourhood of late. No less than four funerals took place in one week. The first was that of a young woman of twenty who had been married about three months, a daughter of Mr. James Selmes of this place. The next was a fine little girl of between seven and eight years, daughter of Mr. Crow of Spring Creek. The others, children at Grabben Gullen. In addition to these a great many of both old and young have had very severe attacks of sickness. The weather continues dry and intensely hot. Grain is plentiful but is beginning to dry up; and some bush-fires have already taken place. Farmers have been busy threshing out the wheat, some of which has turned out very fair and some very indifferently. I have not heard of any extra ordinary yield in this quarter. A great deal of grain has already found its way to market. The potato-crops are much in want of rain. A good downpour would be most beneficial, as farmers would be able to start the plough. I understand that an organised band of horse stealers are carrying on operations in this neighbour hood. Some valuable animals have been stolen. When, I ask, is the promised police station to be established at Grabben Gullen ? February 19th.
