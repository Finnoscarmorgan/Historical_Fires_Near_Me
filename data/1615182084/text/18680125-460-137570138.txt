Of the jim of the crops, irrespective of the damage them, we have the pame taixM About Morrison's, it is said tbatthu oafc$w« will not average twenty busheU to the acw* but that the wheat, although generally affected more or less by botih tthut dnd rtW,T will average fully thirty bushels to the act®. The best crops being late, the Tust Mn» checked in time by the advent of fine wea* ther. The harvest news from the Ballast district is still favourable, excepting asbefortf the effects of the late wet weather, and the , showers of heavy rain and hail appear to have done most damage there by beating out a portion of the standing corn. Little is said of the sprouting of the cut grain; but the late- cut hay, still in the field, bos suffered seriously. The Star tells q£ heavy crops in some parts of the district, and of satisfactory yields, both of wheat and oats, obtained by that safest of all teeta, the threshing-machine. ID the earlier pairfe' of the district this is hard at work, while the cutting of oats only commenced last week at Bullarook, and the wheat will not be ripe for some time. In the Creswick direction wheat crops are spoken of that will give from forty to fifty bushels to the acre, and oat crops eai. ciliated to yield seventy or eighty. If the rein has done mischief, it lu»! also done good, in prolonging the time for getting in thehat-, vest, and there is no scarcity oflabtrar forth? purpose anywhere this year. Bains have fallen over the greater part of New South Wales, in some places heavily, and in others sufficiently so to put out th^ bush'fires, and give the young grass a good start.
