The Bench' then retired^ .and upon re turning !thb:Police. Magistrate- said.:that, with the evidence before them, it was , im possible for -the .

The Police Magistrate said that ho considered it the worst case of common assault that had ever come before that Court, and ho had very little doubt that, had, the 'case been brought before the Supreme Court, one , of the defendants at least would havo re ceived two years' imprisonment.' It was only in their power to inflict a fine, or, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment. They considered the case so bad that they would inflict tho full penalty. ; The defendants wore therefore fined .£10 each, or in default thereof they were to be' each imprisoned for six months.

'rrrThe, .prizes; won in rifle shooting' by the '2nd 'Volunteer Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, (late, 23rd. Middlesex) wore dis tributed recently; at St: James's Hall, by iLady.jWolsbloy.' Lord Wolselyj replying tp.a vote of thanks to Lady Wplsoley, pb 'se^yed'that the more closely the ; bonds of union' were ^ drawn 'between' the' army and the auxiliary, forces,' the more .it . would be to the advantage of all concerned. The presence of the' officers pf the Rbyal Fusiliers was: of happy augury, and told him that ?those reforms .which had been adopted to join the various 'portions of her Majesty's army had been productive of good.' 'When he thought- of that Volun teer f6rcb which now s'o! many years ago ?was;set on, foot,' he beUeved that if any member of the army had' been1 told 'at 'tho commencement that' at this time such a battalion as he had seen that night, so well 'Bet, .up and,.inib,ued with such military spirit, would be created from it, ho would have regarded the person who told him so as a fool or inadman. 'It -was said we were not a military nation, and we were not, if judged' by the number of -troops we had enrolled. But if riot a military nation, we were the moat warlike. No nation was so frequently at war, and we should be pre pared; but beyond this thoro was, he believed, a war impending with which our army would not fie able to cope. There fore 'it was a f ortunato thing ? that tho country had this great Volunteer force, which had gone on increasing year by year, till this year it was Btrongor than ever. There were at the present moment, by. the returns in tho War Office, . over 2000 more efficient men than evbr before in the Volunteer force. ..-,-?? ?The Rov. G. T.
