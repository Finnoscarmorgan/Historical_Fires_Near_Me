The despatch sent by Earl Cabnabvon to Sir Hebcules Robinson, upon the sub ject of pardoning criminals, is not likely to find favor in the Australian colonies, where the whofe scope of dqmes tic .government is, 'believed to be centred! fey their several Goni stitutibn Acts. This despatch has been called forth by! the gardiner imbroglio , and the gist of itji contents is that the prerogative of pardon belongs entirely to the Crown, and that no colonial Minister has a reversionary interest in its exercise or dispensation. Earl C abnarvpn:s view rfAhe ease- jjs£hat . the Governor of a colony is " personally selected by the Sovereign as the depository 'ofthia pjrerogative, which is not aiienated "from the.Crown by any general delegation, but onlyjconfided as a matter" of Mgh'troet to those individuals whom the Crown com missions ifor this purpose." The rationale of all this is that colonial Ministers have no power iij themselves to pardon a man or woman imprisoned for crime. They may recommend to a Governor ; the exercise1 of the | prerogative, but it is quite optional .with him afterwarcs whether "he" gives effect -to : their advice or de clines tb pay any attention to it. We are not prepared to dispute' this theory, the .pushing of ..which now-a-days, we imagine, wilLtake many well-informed politicians by anrprife. ! But it -certainly opens up a' very . chrious state of affairs in connection with piiahments which kre -ineted'-'-out "for- "breacnes i of, ;the - law . in,; rthp. colonies., subverjts that old f dndamehtal principle of constitutibnal- go venimentp that thoae -iyfao: can create can destroy, and distinguishes between jhe 'decrees OF "Parliimeht anff the poiver of |dismissal,.iD anything |)t a.satjfi- . Faotoiy spirit or Consistent method. "Fbrin- stance,: Parliament .' order»r the inflictaon -Qf : CCTtain penalties for specified offences, and JihejUxqyerhihent Is 'jhthorisbl by Its coin- taitBsion to.carry them into . efet, ,w.hen the. awardsrof the Judges have been made." But Jhe pnvilfege of putting the.law in"nperatioji- -against an offender lies with the Government, vQ3efe;'by refuting to move, Could neutralise all these; decrees,, and , all the. .machinery,, which is j provided by "law for the pnr-_ Of carrying e them into 'effect. : ? The; only power existing to call the Government to account for such ladies - wbfild' lie with 'Parliament ; but supposing a. case wherejn tjie 'latter were venal enough to side with thiB Government, and were stubbnni in its atti- tude: then the Governor would be powerless to. force them into compliance with the law, or1iito taking the preliminary measures necessary to secure a conviction. He might "dismiss his Ministers to achieve Jhis object, but.' lift would be at the risk of losing supples land a revolution. In such a case- Parliament would refuse to coun tenance the new advisers, and therefore, practically, no gain would accrue to the Governor by resorting to this extreme step. Hence the inconsistent nature p_the theory urged by| fiari Carnarvon viiirbeseen" at agljmCe. So long as a wrong-doer is at large, the Crown has no power over his arrest orl punishment ; while once he has been '-sentenced byainigefprthejshaiQBaimA.' munity ceases to have any control over his incarceration. Responsibility exists in the doe' pbase of the case, irresponsibility in the other ; and no clearer effect of the absurdity, of such an arrangement — of sepa rating the responsibility of detaming Or li&e-;" rating, ccinvicts frcun the Government, and. centreing the latter in the Governor — could 'possibly beasksd for thanthe-'veryint&roijo; JSlMdhias drawn forth this Downing Street deliverance: " The "representative df : the' Crown and Hovenuneut; are,. jxitb hqddled together In the New South Wales fiasco, whereas ; if " the priinlb'gS-Df 1 afl vffin g : the Goyeor to .pardon, crimintis had heep . centred, (in the"" Government' ' as "'the' powpr of ' moving the ; Jaw iagaiiiBt: < thenar ,ie i®fe£»Sir Hebcules Robpson would haye.:)es<j;aped 'all 'tie -odfdm iii 'winch he- has! become involved; over .- this. .Gabdi-: . nee episode, and the whole trdnbie would tben hffre devolved upon-bis late?2Hmisters:' Fn tiiat iase he would oniy have had to change his advisers ihr derereni bo the 8Im |>adiamm,-#pd-.tbe, .afe.dip.-E. bulty would have ceased so far as the" Crown was concerned ; whereas the pre judices excited by the liberation of the bush- rangeryeannot now be removed, no matter whathoureetfaeGoverBOT-maypuiBuetupm-' yide No®!
