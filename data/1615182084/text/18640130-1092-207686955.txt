KAPUNDA. [Correspondent.] January 29. The bush-fire I * mentioned in my last was not on the Julia Creek, as stated, but in^the neighbourhood of Mr. Abraham White's, and Mr. G-illow's, on the Light. A.n inquest was held yesterday at the latter gentleman's residence, by Mr. J. S. Brown, S.M., Coroner, and a respectable jury, of whom Mr. O. White was foreman, to enquire into its origin. After a great many witnesses had been examined, the Jury returned a verdict to the effect, " that how the fire originated was unknown." This is, I am informed, the fourth fire that has taken place in that district, and on the last occaBiou had not the conflagration been extinguished when it was, it must in a few minutes have reached Mr. White's wheat paddock, when the result must have been disastrous, and, pro bably, the whole neighbourhood would have been one mass of conflagration. Messrs. White and Q-oodchild intend offering 10,000 bushels of wheat for sale to-morrow by auction, which is rather a novel proceeding for this place, but i3 likely that there will be much com petition, as there are several wheatbuyers established here, irrespective of those who attend on Saturday's to purchase for firms in other places. The weather is all that can be desired for the farmers to enable them to reap their crops advan tageously, but it will be some time before the whole are gathered. Owing to the farmers being thus employed the. quantity of wheat coming to market is not so large as it was a few days' since. The prices to-day are—Wheat, 4s. per bushel j oats, from 5s. to 6s. do. j barley, 2s. 6d. do. Flour, £12 per ton.
