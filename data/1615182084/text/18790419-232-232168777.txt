THE FEBRUARY FATAL BUSH- FIRES. [Br Electric Telegraph."} COLAC, Friday Evening. IFBOH OUB OWH CORRESPONDENT.) The enquiry iato the recent fatal bueh-fires at Irrewillipe in February last was resumed this afternoon, before the coroner. Inspector Burton was present, and put the questions. Mr Hancock, eolicitor, watched the C8se for Mr Witchell Standley. William Billings, father and son, and George Woods were subjected to long crossexaminations by counsel, but their testimony on the first occasion was not shaken in the slightest degree. Mr S land ley contradicted flatly all evidence as to fires being ignited for two months previous to the fatal disaster, or that he had ever been cautioned. Messrs Woods and King asserted that they cautioned him and the Billings (three), and said they saw smoke issuing a short time previous from some logs that had been burnt, not earlier than a week before the fatal disaster. A carpenter, named Charles Ay res, who built Mr Standley's hou«e, stated (though not summoned as a witness) that on either the 21st or 22nd of January last, Mr Stand ley burnt some grass and scrub growing in his paddock. The enquiry lasted three h&urs.; The jnry returned a verdict ** That the fireoriginated in &fr; Witchell Standley's paddock, but there was no evidence to show the cause/' One juryman contradicted the foreman while he was delivering the verdict, although what he said meant really the tame thing. The court, however was again cleared, and the following verdict subsequently brought in:—" That there was no evidence to show the origin of the fire."
