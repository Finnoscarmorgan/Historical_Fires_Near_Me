WIIEEO. (From our correspondent.) WEA?rTrn.-During the past week we have been favoured with several refreshing showers, which have done a vast amount of good, not only to the potato-crops and grass, but also by oextinguishing the bush-fires which were raging all round this noigh bourhood. Those showers, however, have boon very partial, and a day or two of general rain would hbe xtremely welcome. Farmers are taking ad vantage of the fine weather by having their grain threshed. Several mnoahinoes are busily employed; and if the fino weather continues for a woek or two, all the wheat and oats in this locality will be throshed out. The grain generally is good; but with few exceptions the yield is considerably under the average. This I think is attributable to the unusually largo quantities of blaolr oats and rye grass with which the wheat is mixed this year. Oricket.-The Whoeo team was defeated at Gun ning; but some of the bost players did not go, and those who went wore unfortunate, the boaest bat having to retire with a cipher. The Whoeo players were very handsomely entertained by those of Gun ning, and in the evening, after dinner, the Whoeo men were cheered to their hotel. The return match is to be played at Wheeo on Saturday, the 21st in otant, when some splendid play is expected, and Whoeo will go in to win if possible. On Saturday, the 14th, a match is to be played at Binda between eleven boys residing in that neighbourhood and an equal number from Whooo. The players are to be under sixteen years of ago.
