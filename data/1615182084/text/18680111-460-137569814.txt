Wheat is in more demand again here since the re duction in price, but ilo large quantity is offering. Oats have been dull of sale again since it has become plain that there will be no great deficiency of them either; but maize is firm in price, and is really becoming scarce. The number of loads of hay sent in to market is becoming veiy laige ; and although the demand has been brisk as yet, prices must dt'cline before the end of the week if the supply continues so full. Every week better accounts of the harvest I arc received, and the total yield of wheat pro- i [ miscs to be very nearly equal to that of last year, as the additional extent of new land under this crop will make up for the failures. Around Newstead the wheat is almost all cut, and the yield is allowed in most in stances to be very satisfactory. On exposed parts of the high land cultivated along the dividing range some injury was done by late frosts, but the rust has not prevailed to any extent At fiullareok some fields of wheat have suffered from the former cause, but the oats are tolerably good. About Sineaton there are good and bad crops, the latter only on land that has been tilled a long time. At Kangaroo-hill both wheat and oats will yield well, and the same may be said of the Creswick and dunes districts. Farther west the rust has done little harm, but about Colac, Camperdown, Mortlake, and Hamil ton a large quantity of grain will be gathered in. The weather for some time past has been very favourable to the late crops, and they will be the best, having thriven amazingly within the last two or three weeks. Although early sowing ought to be the most certain, and issoinsuchseasonsasweused to have, yet it has now happened for three years in succession that the crops of grain sown late have yielded better than those sown In what is usually considered good time. The character of the seasons have doubtless had much to do with this, but it has happened too that very much of the late sown land has also been new land. Up to the end of the year the drought prevailed in New South Wales, but now the weather appears to haw broken all over that colony. Bush-fires were very Bevere, and did much mischief ; but if the rains continue'for any time there will soon be plenty of feed again. The Hooter River district ap pears to have suffered as much as any from both causes, and until the tain came it was supposed that there would be little or no maiiethis year ; a week ago, however, all the holders of alluvial ground on the river fiats were preparing to plant, some of them for the second time, and, with a heavy shower or two in due time to give strength to the yonng plants, they may still have ia fair crop. It has often, happened that maize planted on these northern river flats, even after this time of year,1 has yielded well. At the Cforence and Manning Riyert, too, the maize planters set to work after the first heavy showers which fell some tenor twelve days since, and hope has replaced the feeling of., despair that was becoiriing general Amongst the farmers of those oortherti districts at the prospect of a long, drought But when the weather does break, at this season, it ia generally a sign that the northern settlements are to have a phare of the tropical rains,' which soon restore, their verdure and productiveness. The vineyards promised well in most parts of the colony; but.accoiding to the JUawarra Mer cury the oidiuvi has appeared within the last few days In some of the vineyards there, and is spreading last. It is described as haying appeared suddenly in different spots, mite common form of mildew, which spreads rapidly,; and causes the young fruit to shrivel; i*p] and decay. If %his be really the much dreaded disease which caused such loss to the vinegrowers of Europe and America, it will be of very great consequence to as to learn how it originated in these colonies, whether spontaneously or not This ought to be ascertained as soon as possible, that we may prove if the spread of it ever the whole of the colonies is to be guarded against. We used to fancy ourselves safe out here; but if it has broken out spontaneously in the two northern colonies, even the inost stringent legislation will not keep it out of the others. On this dayweek Mr. Wooff *ead a paper on the''subject to the florticultural Society at Sydney, in which he" aeems to favour the spontaneous theory, and saysthafc we may expect the disease to appear , on all vines here as they beoome weak from age, or from having been grown in, unsuitable and badly-drained land, but that vines in full ha4tb will resist the infection. This is another question that ought to be set, at rest; for if such be ithe case, the man who ,makes, orhasmade, a vineyard in an improper^ pl^, or withottt dralning and trenching, wiU kndw what he has in a few year9 to expect If. «»<} he «uJ4$H to the , list, we shall soon b&ve; all the various forms of.-mildew, rust, and 1Aight thatare I known. .' -'.\i ^ ? ;? ? ; 'Now thqit'the extent of mis$hipf?s:be> * ginning to he pre#y,well ascertained, the South Australians are wondering again «yt the enable 4he wheat plant io resifit lthe at. thought' by) #okne W^teth&b;&fe; okfestkifL advises - that thi» shbuld; be >im>ug!tt >4tom i Call f ami* ^He 'says ifcat b fcari y all fee 1 is soM'irt iwas 1 viloped rtoy^heislotar abdoj^twnt;<rfr1ih<&t;*ij&« mm tliat before it haa been subjected to ahy't great change of weather, so thfct wb^ die first moisture reaches it in the grt^jj' tjie young plant springs up suddenly an^ Mrith less enduring tigtnir thin itwduld hav» from older grain.
