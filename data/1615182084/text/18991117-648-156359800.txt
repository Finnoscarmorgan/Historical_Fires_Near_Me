LOCAL BREVITIES. ———♦——— To-day the sun rises at 4 43 a.m. and sets at 6.38 p.m. * * * Mr. H. M. S Cox, of Rawden, donated a horse to the 1st Aus- tralian Horse. * * * The present warm weather is causing a very rapid rise of yolk in wool, and buyers will have to be a bit wary. * * * Nearly the last of Coolah station changed hands on Wednesday. The prices obtained were good, but by no means exorbitant. * * * Tho best informed wool men in Sydney, state that high prices will rule next year, so our sheep men will be having good times. They deserve their luck. * * * A pity that deluge which fell at Lawsons Creek on Sunday, had not fallen at the head of the water supply catchment. We would have had plenty water then. * * * Alderman Wilton states that he intends to proceed with his scheme to borrow money for the making of the roads in tho Cudgegong Borough * * * A man is advertising in the " Daily Telegraph " for a steam stone crusher. Mudgee Council please note, Better by far sell a thing if there is no use for it. * * * Mr. George Rouse had a letter last week from his station manager in Queensland, and a sorry tale is told of probable decimation of flocks and herds, if rain does not fall shortly. Truly, the squatter's is not a bed of roses now-a-days, according to all accounts. * * * The contemplated removal of Mr. Wilkinson, P.M., is another in- justice to Mudgee, concerning which we intend saying a good deal more. It seems to be the outcome of Departmental high-handedness and injustice. * * * Electors should always read the official correspondence published by Mr. E. Richards, M.L.A. It tells them what is being done to carry out the wants of the electo- rate. * * * The rainfall on Sunday was very patchy. While only light showers fell in Mudgee, between three and four inches of rain fell up Lawson's Creek way, in the vicinity of G. Rope's farm. It was described as a regular waterspout. * * * Mr. Head, of Bobadeen, visited Forbes this week, to inspect a nice little lot of sheep offered him. Mr. Head purchased a thousand from Mr. Nevin before starting to Forbes. * * * The new position that Mr. J. J. Phillips will hold, as manager of the Southern branch of the Bank of New South Wales is an important one. He will have twelve or fifteen clerks under him. Among the accounts at this branch is the well known Anthony Hordern and Sons, which is an immense one in itself. * * * The country butchers were in great numbers at Crossing and Cox's sale on Tuesday last. Tom Norris, of Capertee, were among the num- ber. Mr. Norris is extending his well-known butchering trade. He has just completed the purchase of Mr. H. Holland's butchery at Cudgegong. * * * Mrs. Gardoll, formerly a resident of McDonald's Creek, died on Saturday at her residence, near Liverpool. Deceased was the mother of Mrs. George Sharp, of Burrundulla, and of Mrs. W. Marchant. The deceased, with her husband, left Mudgee some years ago, after disposing of their pro- perty at McDonald's Creak. —————————————— The late Mudgee races were the best yet held by the club. * * * Havilah shearing will conclude within the next fortnight. * * * The case against Mr. Joseph Kurtz for wool-stealing was dis- missed by the bench on Monday. * * * Mr. Hooke, the popular host of Turee, passed through on Monday evening, to attend the sheep sales. * * * Saturday is the 59th anniversary of the landing of the last convict at Sydney. * * * The well-known painter, Mr. A. Lowe, has secured the contract for painting the Bank of New South Wales building at Gulgong. * * * Mr. Ned Woolley, on Wednesday, purchased the Sydney Hotel from Mr. James Loneragan. The invest- ment should prove a good one. * * * Those who wish Christmas cards to reach tho old country in time must post in Mudgee not later than Monday next. * * * Mr. George Stewart has returned from his Melbourne Cup visit on Wednesday. He thought the Cup day one of the sights of a lifetime. * * * Mr. C R. Young, of Gulgong, continues to forward to Mudgee large parcels of wool purchased by him from district sheep men. * * * The social in aid of the prize fund at Havilah school has been postponed to Friday, 1st December. Tickets will be procurable at the door. * * * A social tea in connection with the Primitive Methodist C. E. Society, held on Wednesday night, was a great success. * * * The telephone is gradually ex- tending in our town. The latest addition has been the extension to the Corporation Sale Yards by Mr. H. Crossing. * * * We have heard that Mr. Searl, manager of Cooyal butter factory, is leaving the district to take charge of a factory in another part. Cooyalitcs generally will regret losing Mr. Searl. * * * Mr. Jack Ayers left for Sydney this week with the Trident horse, Storm King, which ran unsuccess- fully at the Mudgee races. The compact little grey is to join the ranks of the ponies. * * * There is demand for young sheep. A well-known station man informs us that there is not a young wether under offer in this district. Should rain fall shortly, sheep of reason- able ages for stocking purposes will fetch stiff prices. * * * Mr. Hunter, a son-in-law of Mr. Jacob Rohr, is spending a holiday at Piainbong. Mr. Hunter was at one time a Government official in the Health Department, but now holds a good position in the Colo- nial Sugar Co.'s works at Fiji. * * * Mr. H. A. Pocklington, of the Exchange Corner, forwards us a unique copy of the " Sydney Morn- ing Herald." It contains the re- port of the great farewell to the Transvaal contingent, and has been reduced in size by photography. The letters are most minute but quite easily read, and from every point of view it is an interesting souvenir. * * * The Cheviot colt, Taciturn, which trainer Donoghue had in hand for some time, and which gave every promise of developing into a really good sort, has been relegated to the paddock. It is only a short time since this horse recovered from an attack of in- fluenza, and it was deemed ad- visable not to start him at the late meeting. —————————————— West End and Gulgong meet in a whole day match on West End wicket next Saturday. * * * The R over G (Reeves Bros.' Grattai clip) fetched the splendid average price of 14¼d per lb. * * * The Ben Buckley syndicate drew a cash prize in the Melbourne Cup sweep. * * * Threatening weather, but not enough rain to speak of. Somo farmers have not yet got their corn in. * * * In future all advertisements of stock impounded at the Mudgee pound will appear in the GUARDIAN. There is one in to-day. * * * Some nomadic anarchist has written on Holyoak bridge, " No Law, no God, no Property, no Master." * * * The bold Pirates were defeated by a Mudgee team on Wednesday, after a sharp encounter. The second shot laid low the Major- General. * * * The scramble for wool clips is going on lively throughout the dis- trict, sporting bids being made at the little sheds especially for clips of good quality. * * * Mr. G. Kenniwell, of tho Ex- change Corner Studios, will have the finished photos, of the Pirates ready for Saturday. They will be on view in the show case, and are really excellent. * * * Miss Sarah Hazeltine, Mudgee's " Queen of Song," has been delight- ing Grenfell audiences. During the performance there were several patriotic outbursts, the whole com- pany and audience singing " Soldiers of the Queen " and " Rule Britannia." * * * Mr. E. M. Bowman, of War- gundy, was in town on Wednesday. Mr. J. M. Cox, secretary of the Agricultural Society, secured his promise to keep some fleeces for the wool section of the district exhibit for the Mudgee show. * * * The George-street electric tram- way has only cost £130,000 more than the estimate. We hope that the officers responsible will all get the sack. There is too much of this sort of thing in Government work. * * * In another column there appears a letter addressed to the Premier of the Railway Commissioners, in which the Mudgee Coonamble line is emphatically supported against the Dubbo extension. The duty of Parliament is as clear as daylight. * * * Mr. E. M. Bowman, of War- gundy, tells us his sheep are giving heavy fleeces of grand quality. When tho figures are complete we will publish them, and they will open the eyes of some people. * * * The " Guardian " is losing no op- portunity of representing to our producers and manufacturers the great advantage of a big display in the Mudgee district exhibit at the Sydney show. The project is be- ing most warmly received, and a magnificent displuy is certain. * * * Before the Australian Horse went on board the troopship for the Transvaal, Lieutenant W. V. Dowling, speaking on behalf of the officers and men, expressed appre- ciation of the good work done by Warrant Officer Duncan, and pre- sented him with a gold ring. * * * The election of directors of the Coonabarabran Co-operative Flour Mill took place last week, and the following gentlemen were appointed to the position : —Messrs J. Jones, T. Deans, John Wark, R. Murehi- son, John Knight, W. Gardiner, D. McGregor. We may mention that the directors receive no fees. —————————————— Mr. Campbell Lawson, represen- tative of the well-known firm of J. C. Young and Co., wool-brokers, was, in Mudgee this week on busi- ness. * * * It looks as though we are going to have a hot, dry summer. Large areas of wheat are now quite beyond recovery. * * * Mr. E. R. Scott, manager of the Hampden and Homeward Bound Mines, Hargraves, was in town this week. He reports that the shaft in the Homeward Bound cut the tun- nel, and that crushing will start next week. The winze is to be sunk a further depth of 50 feet. * * * Mr. W. Clark, of the Church street saddlery, has removed into the premises lately occupied by Messrs. Gordon and Pateman, tailors, opposite Rogerson's hotel, and will be pleased to see all his old friends. * * * There is serious trouble between Mr. C. A. Coghlan, of the Public Service Board, and the Govern- ment. Mr. Coghlan is also Govern- ment Statistician. He is a clever man, but appears to have become too big for his boots. * * * Up at Harry Hunt's on Sunday fully 4 inches of rain was registered during the heavy storm. We believe that fences were washed down in all directions. * * * Grass is drying fast — and bush- fires will be blazing very soon. Great care should be exercised by smokers and others against the care- less use of fires. * * * Mudgee Racing Club Committee had quite a parliamentary meeting on Monday afternoon, sitting from 3 o'clock to 9 p.m. The committee adjourned for tea, and the result as reported elsewhere. * * * There are several very important matters to be discussed at the meeting of the Agricultural Society's committee on Saturday, and it is therefore to be hoped there will be a good attendance. * * * A little deluge fell last week over a narrow strip of country stretching from Birriwa, through a portion of Bobadeen, and on north-east. It was only a patch visitation, perhaps three inches falling in less than half an hour. * * * Messrs. Scholer and Co., Coolah's well-known storekeepers, are doing a good business. No wonder, con- sidering the splendid stock kept by them, and the low prices for which the firm is noted. * * * Mr. Loban, now a resident of Sydney, is renewing his application to the Mines Department to assist, him , in looking for gold ,at a deep level at Budgee Budgee. Mr. Higgins, of Log Paddock, like many other practical miners, thinks tho Budgee deep ground should be prospected, * * * The first day labour work authorised to be done in this dis trict is being carried out at Lin burn, under tho supervision of Mr. 'Jerry' Wall, nmintainance man on that sido. Mr. Archer lias em ployed six mon on this bit of road work, for which Mr. Richards ob tained a grant of .£50. The men employed are all residents in tho immediate locality and can reach thoir homes overy night. * * * Passengers who went second class from Mudgee to Wallerawang on Monday evening were treated for the first time to a corridor car, with lavatory conveniences. The necessity for these second class lavatory cars on this principle was brought under the notice of the Railway Commissioners by Mr. Richards, and the Commissioners show their recognition by giving Mudgee line the first carriage of the kind. —————————————— Heavy storms are heard of from many parts of the district. * * * It is seventy-five years to-day since the Murray river was first crossed. * * * The committee of the Agricul- tural Society meets on Saturday afternoon at 2.30 p.m. * * * We hear that influenza is very bad in some parts of the district. There are several eases at Havilaha * * * We heard the other day that Mr. C. E. Hilton, who is in Sydney on dredging business, had been laid up with influenza. * * * The Cudgegong Council has de- cided to metal the road from Holy- oak Bridge to Lawson's Creek, on the Bombira Hill road. It will cost close on £250. * * * The Rylstone branch of the A.J.S. Bank has notified that in future 1s exchange will be charge on all cheques up to £50. Pretty stiff this. * * * Mr. J. R. Atkinson, of Cullen- bone, tells us that Hungarian mil- let for hay is a most valuable crop. Sow now. * * * Once again the fact is demon- stratad. beyond dispute that the early sowing of wheat is one of the great secrets of its successful culture. * * * This week Mr. Harold Hard- wick, architect, started Murphy Bros, (contractors) to work on Mr W. J. Mattick's fourteen-roomed residence at Forest Lodge, Har- graves. * * * Large numbers of interested wool growers have called to the GUAR- DIAN office to see the Victorian lamb's wool, which fetched 21½d per lb. * * * On Sunday Charles Bolton, of Red Flat, near Cassilis, fell from a tree, which he was climbing, and sustained fractures of the jaw and arm. He was removed to the Gulgong Hospital. * * * Mr. R. Rouse, jun., of Biragan- bil, will be leaving shortly for a health trip to New Zealand. He was to have been accompanied by Mr. B. Stacy, of the Commercial Bank, but that gentleman will not be leaving for his Maoriland trip till after the New Year. * * * The delayed subsidy due to the Mudgee hospital; is a disgrace to the Government officers concerned. The exhibition of red tape has been most extensive, and it is all non- sence for the department to try to shift the blame on to any little little minor errors at this end They were corrected at once, when they were pointed out. * * * A Guardian representative spoke to Mr. J. A. Buckland, of Pine Ridge, about bringing his champion trotters to the next Mudgee show. Mr. Buckland, after ascertaining the date of the Mudgee Exhibition, promised to consider the matter, Mr. Buckland's horses are at present located at Wonbobbie, but will be brought to Pine Ridge as soon as suitable stable premises-are erected. * * * Mr. William Standford, who was a teacher in Mudgee district some years ago, died at Manildra, in Molong district, on Sunday last. Deceased, it will be remembered, married Miss Clara Southwict, sister of Mr. George Southwick, an old and respected Mudgeeite. ln Molong district the late Mr. Stanford evidently was as popular aud respected as he was during his early life in Mudgee. The account of tht funeral shows this— the con- course gathered to pay last respects being evidence of a people's moun- ing and a Masonic burial.
