## Geolocation
# Intention
The goal in producing an individually authored heuristics was not to achieve precision, rather the intention was to remove the obfuscation of proprietary geocoding approaches, thereby, facilitating a  transparent level of confidence regarding the provisionality of the dataset itself. That is, this approach allows the author to declare the commitments of the data and enable discussion or criticism based on an understanding from first principles. And to qualify the ‘ambiguity’ of the data at each stage.
